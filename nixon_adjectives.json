        "Looking ahead to the year 2000, and it is very difficult to look much beyond that, but I think there is a better chance than there has been since World War II that because the relationships which Carl Vinson has spoken to, that we have established with countries with whom we have nothing in common as far as ideology is concerned--in fact, we differ completely with Chou En-lai, Mao Tse-tung, Mr. Brezhnev, Podgorny and their colleagues---but because of the initiatives we have taken, we may be establishing the pattern which will mean that the great powers will recognize that the risk of war is too great for them to engage in adventurism in any part of the world, and that the benefits of peace, on the other side, are so much greater that we should use our strength for peace rather than for war.",
