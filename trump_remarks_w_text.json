        "text": "SCHOTT North America Inc.\nDuryea, Pennsylvania\n5:27 P.M. EDT\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, hello, Pennsylvania!\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 To Secretary Wilbur Ross, Congressman Dan Meuser, Congressman Fred Keller, and my friend, Jay Timmons, and above all, to Jim and Rob and all of the incredible men and women of SCHOTT North America: It is great to be back in the Keystone State.\u00a0 Thank you so much for that warm welcome.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd before we get started, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine \u2014 a man who loves the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and who\u2019s been fighting every day for the last three years for manufacturing in this state and all across this country.\u00a0 I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd thanks for that great warm welcome.\u00a0 It really is great to be here \u2014 be here with all of you, and also with a company that\u2019s really creating opportunities, not only in this community, but literally all across America.\nIt is remarkable to think that, 50 years ago, SCHOTT opened its first optics location in the United States of America, right here in Pennsylvania.\u00a0 Fifty years ago, this year.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNow they have facilities all across the country, but this is where it all started.\u00a0 And this is where the confidence of this company grew in the hardworking people of this country.\nSince then, this facility, I\u2019m told, has expanded nearly five times over.\u00a0 You\u2019ve created more than 200 high-skilled jobs.\u00a0 And that\u2019s in addition to more than 1,000 other jobs that SCHOTT has created across America.\u00a0 So let\u2019s hear it for a great American success story: SCHOTT North America.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd I had a chance to meet a number of members of your team that all ended up in the balcony.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Give them a round of applause.\u00a0 This is a great group of people.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 As I told them \u2014 as I told them, this is a great company.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great corporate citizen \u2014 the second largest employer in this community.\nBut there\u2019s also something very special about this place \u2014 because from day one, 50 years ago, this company, this facility has provided the support and the equipment to the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States of America.\u00a0 And you have done it with great professionalism.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn fact, I expect there\u2019s more than a few veterans, men and women who served in the armed forces who are here with us today, members of this team and in this community.\u00a0 If you served in our armed forces, if you\u2019re able, would you mind standing up?\u00a0 Just stand up and let us say thank you one more time.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you for your service.\u00a0 Thank you for your service.\u00a0 Thank you.\nI mean, it\u2019s amazing when you think about what this company has been providing to our warfighters around the world.\u00a0 You make those rifle sites that make it possible for our team to accomplish their mission in the field.\u00a0 You make glass for the Bradley tanks, the Apache helicopters, as well as parts for night vision goggles and for\u00a0mission\u00a0[missile] guidance systems.\nAnd it\u2019s amazing to think about the difference that what you do here, what you create here, has made in securing this nation and providing for our national defense.\u00a0 So give yourselves another round of applause for 50 years of making our warfighters and making America safer.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Great job.\nAnd also, you know, I started today at a big international conference on space.\u00a0 And I\u2019m proud to report to you, under President Trump\u2019s leadership, America is leading in space once again.\u00a0 We\u2019re going back to the Moon and then to Mars.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And I got a feeling SCHOTT is going with us.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 Am I right?\u00a0 It\u2019s true.\u00a0 It\u2019s true.\nI don\u2019t know if you knew this, Wilbur, but products made right at this facility have supported America\u2019s space program from the very beginning.\u00a0 Your products aren\u2019t just used around the world, they\u2019re literally used across the solar system.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nIt\u2019s remarkable to think products here in this building have gone from Pennsylvania to the Moon, and even to the outer reaches of this solar system.\nBut I was pleased to bring with me today, also, a letter of congratulations from that friend that I mentioned.\u00a0 Fifty years of contributing to our national defense.\u00a0 Fifty years of committing to the American space program.\u00a0 I am honored today to deliver a letter congratulating SCHOTT North America from the President of the United States.\u00a0 Congratulations to this great team and this great company.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd I\u2019m glad to hear this success \u2014 50 years \u2014 is just what you all here at SCHOTT call a good start, right?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I mean, the truth is \u2014 the truth is this company is thriving.\u00a0 And under President Trump\u2019s leadership, America is thriving, our economy is booming.\nI mean, over the last three years, this company alone has invested another $32 million just in this facility, expanded the workforce here by 15 percent, and seen sales go up by a third.\u00a0 And if there are any jobseekers out there across Pennsylvania, I just heard, walking in here, SCHOTT is hiring if you\u2019re looking for a job.\u00a0 Give them a call.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Not that that\u2019s any real surprise.\u00a0 Did you know that there\u2019s more job openings today across this country than there are men and women looking for work in the United States?\nAnd I\u2019m here today to celebrate the success of this company, but also \u2014 also to say thank you to each and every one of you for contributing so much to Pennsylvania and so much to the life of this nation.\nBut I\u2019m also here on the President\u2019s behalf because we\u2019ve got a great opportunity.\u00a0 You\u2019ve heard about it from this podium before, and I mean to talk about it.\u00a0 But before I do that, I want to talk about the progress that we\u2019ve made because of the confidence the people of Pennsylvania placed in this President back in 2016.\nYou know, when I think of the last three years, I think there\u2019s only one way you can describe it.\u00a0 It\u2019s been three years of action, three years of results.\u00a0 It\u2019s been three years of promises made and promises kept!\u00a0 But we\u2019re just getting started, Pennsylvania!\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI mean, seriously, the growth in this company, the growth that we see all across America is a result of the leadership that President Trump and our allies in Congress have been delivering since day one of this administration.\nI mean, the President went right to work, from early on.\u00a0 The day after inauguration, we \u2014 we went to work to keep those promises.\u00a0 This President actually signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history.\u00a0 President Trump has already signed more laws repealing federal red tape than any President in the history of this country, and we\u2019ve unleashed American energy.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Incredible.\nDid you know, next year, America will be a net exporter of oil for the first time in 75 years?\u00a0 We\u2019re on the road to energy independence.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd in the midst of all of that tax relief, rolling back red tape, unleashing American energy, this President has also been fighting every day.\u00a0 He\u2019s been fighting every day for trade deals that are free and fair and reciprocal, and trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first.\nThe results have really been remarkable.\u00a0 Since Election Day, businesses just like this one, all across the country, have literally created 6.5 million new jobs.\u00a0 That includes more than 140,000 jobs right here in Pennsylvania.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Isn\u2019t that something?\nThe unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, and the unemployment rate for African Americans and Hispanic Americans is the lowest level ever recorded.\u00a0 The American Dream is working again for every American.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd you know what?\u00a0 It\u2019s not just been more jobs, but it\u2019s been better jobs and better pay.\u00a0 Since President Trump was elected, the average American household has seen your disposable income go up, on average, by $5,000 a year.\nAnd maybe most important to the President and me is that wages are rising.\u00a0 Wages are rising today at the fastest pace that they\u2019ve risen in more than 10 years.\u00a0 Maybe most encouraging of all, wages are rising most rapidly for hardworking, blue-collar Americans.\u00a0 The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s true.\nAnd since President Trump\u2019s election, we\u2019ve seen a real renaissance in manufacturing.\u00a0 I mean, it really is pretty incredible.\u00a0 I mean, you remember the last administration?\u00a0 The President, in the summer of 2016, actually said that 200,000 manufacturing jobs that they\u2019d lost over their eight years in the White House were never coming back.\nI remember when President Obama said, \u201cWhat do you \u2014 you have a magic wand you\u2019re going to wave to bring those jobs back?\u201d\u00a0 Well, we didn\u2019t need a magic wand.\u00a0 We just needed President Donald Trump in the White House. Five hundred thousand manufacturing jobs created in the last three years.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIncredible.\u00a0 Including nearly 2,000 manufacturing jobs just in this state alone.\nAnd results like this don\u2019t just happen.\u00a0 The truth is, all of this happens because of the policies that this President and our allies in the Congress have supported every step of the way.\u00a0 But they also have happened \u2014 they\u2019ve also happened mostly because, quite frankly, working Americans are the best workers in the world.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 All of you are driving the boom in this company, in this state, and in this country.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s true.\nPeople, like a guy I heard about on the way here, who grew up next door in Pittston and who started with SCHOTT immediately after graduating from high school.\u00a0 I\u2019m told he\u2019s actually here with us, with his wife today, who also worked at this facility for 21 years.\u00a0 Today he\u2019s a part of the glass fabrication team.\nAnd I\u2019m actually told \u2014 I had to ask twice \u2014 but he\u2019s actually celebrating 48 years of service to this company.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Would you please join me in thanking Stanley Budzilek?\u00a0 Stanley.\u00a0 Give it up.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Give Stanley and his wife a standing ovation, will you?\u00a0 I mean, that\u2019s an incredible commitment to a great company.\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 Thanks, Stanley.\u00a0 Thanks, Debbie.\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 That\u2019s incredible.\nI\u2019m also told, in addition to these incredible employees that really represent all of you in this great company, we actually have with us more than 100 employees from another great Pennsylvania manufacturer that\u2019s located right across the street.\u00a0 It\u2019s a company that makes electric wheelchairs that are used all across America and provide important service and transportation to Americans (inaudible) of need.\nJust like SCHOTT, this company is growing, I\u2019m told, hiring even more Pennsylvanians as we speak.\u00a0 It\u2019s led by the family of none other than my friend, Congressman Dan Meuser.\u00a0 So let\u2019s give a warm welcome to the workers from Pride Mobility Solutions.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 To a great family and a great company.\u00a0 Thanks, Dan.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTo all of those team members, to Stanley and Debbie, and, really, all of you: I just want to \u2014 I just want to thank you for what you\u2019re doing, seizing on the opportunity to grow this company and grow this state and grow this nation.\u00a0 I mean, each one of you are proving every single day that as long as the playing field is level, American workers can out-compete, out-innovate, and out-work anybody in the world.\u00a0 And you\u2019re doing it every day.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 You are.\nAnd that\u2019s why from the first day of this administration, President Trump has been working to open up markets all over the world.\nThe President renegotiated our trade agreement with South Korea.\u00a0 He signed two new trade agreements with Japan just in the last couple of weeks.\nNegotiations with China are ongoing \u2014 you see it all in the paper \u2014 but President Donald Trump has put China on notice that the era of economic surrender is over.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We\u2019re going to stand up for American jobs and American property in our relations with China.\nBut closer to home, what brings me here today is that this President, now more than a year ago, negotiated the largest trade deal in American history.\u00a0 We call it the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA.\u00a0 And I was there for a lot of the discussions and a lot of the negotiations.\u00a0 And I\u2019m here to tell you, the man who wrote \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d drove a hard bargain.\u00a0 He put American jobs and American workers and American agriculture first.\nAnd the truth is, as I stand here today, the USMCA is languishing in the House of Representatives, isn\u2019t it, guys?\u00a0 I mean, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress have refused to bring the USMCA to the floor.\u00a0 You see the headlines.\u00a0 These days, Democrats are spending all their time on endless investigations and a partisan impeachment, but the American people deserve better.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And I came to Pennsylvania to say it\u2019s time for the Democrats in Congress to put Pennsylvania first.\u00a0 It\u2019s time to pass the USMCA.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 True.\nAnd I came here to tell all of you that it\u2019s \u2014 the time has come for Congressman Matt Cartwright to tell his leadership in the Congress that Pennsylvania needs the USMCA and we need it this year.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYou know, according to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA is going to add more than $68 billion to our economy, right out of the gate.\u00a0 And they project it\u2019s going to create another 175,000 jobs.\u00a0 That includes nearly 50,000 good manufacturing jobs.\nAnd again, we\u2019re not just talking about creating more jobs but better jobs.\u00a0 According to the same report, under the USMCA, American manufacturing workers are going to get another raise in addition to the wage increases you\u2019ve already seen under the policies advanced by this administration.\nI mean, Pennsylvanians today already export more than $15 billion of your goods and services to Canada and Mexico every year.\u00a0 And under the USMCA, as you already heard, that\u2019s only going to grow once we sign it into law.\u00a0 And it\u2019s going to create more jobs and more opportunities here in Pennsylvania.\nBut, honestly, I can tell you, we got our work cut out for us, men and women.\u00a0 I mean, I just heard that former Vice President Biden is going to be in Scranton tomorrow.\u00a0 And before I got off the airplane, I heard he actually came out against the USMCA.\u00a0 I mean, Joe actually put out a statement saying that, quote, \u201cPennsylvanians will not\u2026be fooled\u2026by Pence\u2019s blind promotion of Trump\u2019s irresponsible trade war[s].\u201d\nWell, Joe, Pennsylvanians will not be fooled.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 They know the USMCA is a win for Pennsylvania and a win for America.\u00a0 And it\u2019s time you got on board.\u00a0 I mean, the truth is, Pennsylvania lost 51,000 manufacturing jobs when Joe was Vice President.\u00a0 And the people of Pennsylvania know we can do better than NAFTA.\u00a0 They know they deserve better than NAFTA.\nSo, anyway, if you bump into a familiar face over the next couple of days, tell Joe that Pennsylvania and America need the USMCA and we need it this year.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 But as I said, it\u2019s going to take all of us to get it done.\u00a0 It really is.\nSo I came up to Pennsylvania to tell you to turn up the heat, Pennsylvania.\u00a0 Turn up the heat on Congressman Matt Cartwright.\u00a0 Turn up the heat on the Democrats in Congress.\u00a0 Send a message from the Keystone State that we want to put our jobs and our future first.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI mean, the clock is ticking, so I want you to reach out.\u00a0 Reach out to all of our elected officials in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 I mean, tell them \u2014 say, \u201cYou know, I ran into Mike the other day\u201d \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 \u201cand he seemed very excited about this USMCA.\u00a0 He told us what it\u2019s going to mean for manufacturing, what it\u2019s going to mean for this economy.\u201d\u00a0 And just tell them how important it is.\u00a0 Set politics aside and do what\u2019s right for Pennsylvania and do what\u2019s right for America.\nSo call your elected officials.\u00a0 But let me save you a nickel.\u00a0 You don\u2019t need to call Congressman Dan Meuser or Congressman Fred Keller because they\u2019re leading the charge for the USMCA in Washington.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Great job.\nBut I\u2019ll be honest with you, the Democrats representing Pennsylvania in Washington, D.C., could use to hear from you.\u00a0 And tell them to tell Speaker Pelosi to take that trade deal that\u2019s been on her desk for a year and put it on the floor.\u00a0 I mean, we really believe that if Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Congressman Matt Cartwright put the USMCA on the floor, it\u2019s going to pass, and it\u2019s going to pass on a bipartisan basis \u2014 it truthfully is \u2014 because it\u2019s going to be good for every American.\nAnd while you\u2019re at it, after you get done calling those members of the House, you can call Senator Bob Casey and call Senator Pat Toomey, and tell them the USMCA is a win for Pennsylvania, and you\u2019re counting on their support.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd tell them all \u2014 tell them all how this agreement is going to create more jobs, more manufacturing jobs.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to increase wages all across Pennsylvania and all across America.\nSo, thanks for \u2014 thanks for hearing me out on that.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been traveling all over the country talking about the USMCA.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been traveling with the Secretary of Commerce, visiting manufacturing sites \u2014 I\u2019ll be in Wisconsin a little bit later this week \u2014 just because I know that, for all the progress that we\u2019ve made in this economy, that\u2019s just what this businessman-turned-President calls a \u201cgood start.\u201d\nYou know, one of the most amusing things that I ever hear when I\u2019m traveling around the country \u2014 and I heard it today at the airport when I landed \u2014 is they say, \u201cTell the President to just keep going.\u201d\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 You know?\nBut let me tell you, Pennsylvania, that\u2019s something you never have to tell President Donald Trump.\u00a0 All the reverse is stripped out of that pick-up truck.\u00a0 It just goes forward.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to keep fighting for jobs in Pennsylvania and America.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I\u2019m telling you.\nBut thanks for coming out today.\u00a0 And I look forward to meeting as many of you as time permits before I\u2019m headed out.\nAnd in the days and weeks ahead, I\u2019ll make you a promise:\u00a0Whatever Democrats in Washington, D.C., want to spend their time doing, President Trump and I are never going to stop fighting to keep the promises that we made to the people of Pennsylvania.\u00a0 We\u2019re never going to stop working to grow this economy and make America more safe, more prosperous, and secure.\u00a0 We\u2019re never going to stop delivering on that agenda of a strong national defense, secure borders, conservatives on our courts at every level, and jobs, jobs, jobs.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo we\u2019re going to keep going forward, and we\u2019re going to keep fighting.\u00a0 And I have to \u2014 I have to believe, the confidence of people of Pennsylvania \u2014 the confidence of people of Pennsylvania who carried us in 2016 is carrying us to this day.\nBecause the truth is, I have \u2014 I have faith.\u00a0 I have faith in this President that Pennsylvania said yes to \u2014 that, every single day, he\u2019s going to keep fighting to do all the things that have made this nation more secure and more prosperous.\nI have faith in all of you and the people of this country.\u00a0 When given the opportunity to expand and create growth, expand opportunities for yourselves and your families, make your communities more prosperous, the American people seize on that opportunity.\nAnd finally, in these too divided of times, I have that other kind of faith.\u00a0 You know, it seems like every time I turn on the television, people are talking about what divides the people of this country.\u00a0 But I\u2019ll always believe that there\u2019s always been more that unites us in these United States of America than will ever divide us.\u00a0 And chief among that is faith.\nAnd with faith in Him who planted this miracle of democracy on these wilderness shores, I know the best days for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and America are yet to come.\nSo let\u2019s go to work, Pennsylvania.\u00a0 Let\u2019s go to work with confidence and faith.\u00a0 Let\u2019s keep advancing the policies that will make this country safer and more prosperous than ever before.\nAnd with President Trump in the White House, with your continued support, with the USMCA signed into law, with strong support from our allies in Congress, and with God\u2019s help, we\u2019re going to make Pennsylvania safer than ever before.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to make Pennsylvania and America more prosperous than you could possibly imagine.\u00a0 And to borrow a phrase, we\u2019re going to keep making America great again.\nThanks, everybody.\u00a0 God bless you.\u00a0 God bless Pennsylvania.\u00a0 And God bless America.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEND\n5:53 P.M.

EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 We have a Cabinet meeting.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have a few questions after grace.\u00a0 And, if you would, Ben, please do the honors.\nSECRETARY CARSON:\u00a0 Our kind Father in Heaven, we\u2019re so thankful for the many blessings that you have bestowed upon us in this country.\u00a0 And we\u2019re thankful for the people of courage who have been here before us, who have fought hard for the rights of our country.\nAnd we thank you for President Donald Trump, who also exhibits great courage in face of constant criticism.\u00a0 And we ask that you would give him strength to endure and the wisdom lead, and to recognize you as the sovereigns of the universe with the solution to everything.\nAnd the people around the President \u2014 the Vice President, the Cabinet, the advisors \u2014 give us all an understanding heart and a compassionate heart.\u00a0 Those are the things that will keep America great.\u00a0 And help us all to recognize as a nation that separation of church and state means that the church does not dominate the state, and it means the state does not dominate the church.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t mean that they cannot work together to promote godly principles of loving your fellow man, of caring about your neighbor, of developing your God-given talents to the utmost so that you become valuable to the people around you, and having values and principles that govern your life.\nAnd if we do those things, then we will always be successful.\u00a0 And we thank you for hearing our prayer, in your Holy name.\u00a0 Amen.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 All right, thank you, Ben.\u00a0 That was a great job.\u00a0 Appreciate it.\nThe economy is doing fantastically well.\u00a0 It\u2019s getting very close to another record.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had many records since we won office.\u00a0 We\u2019re getting very close to another record.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if anybody saw it: The household median income for eight years of President Bush, it rose $400.\u00a0 For eight years of President Obama, it rose $975.\u00a0 And for two and half years of President Trump \u2014 they have it down as two and a half years \u2014 it rose $5,000, not including $2,000 for taxes.\u00a0 So it rose, let\u2019s say, $7,000.\u00a0 So in two and a half years, we\u2019re up $7,000, compared to $1,000, compared to $400.\u00a0 And that\u2019s for eight years and eight years.\nThat\u2019s a number that just came out, but that\u2019s a number that I don\u2019t know how there could be any dispute or any \u2014\u00a0I\u2019ve never heard a number like that, meaning the economy is doing fantastically well.\nWe need \u2014 for our farmers, our manufacturers, for, frankly, unions and non-unions, we need USMCA to be voted on.\u00a0 If it\u2019s voted on, it\u2019ll pass.\u00a0 It\u2019s up to Nancy Pelosi to put it up.\u00a0 If she puts it up, it\u2019s going to pass.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be very bipartisan.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that\u2019s very much needed.\u00a0 It\u2019ll be hundreds of thousands of jobs.\nMexico and Canada have approved it; it\u2019s done.\u00a0 They\u2019re waiting for our approval.\u00a0 And we can\u2019t seem to get the votes.\u00a0 I call them the Do-Nothing Democrats; I mean that.\u00a0 They\u2019ve done nothing.\u00a0 But this is something they can do very easily.\u00a0 We\u2019ll give them bipartisan approvals and credits \u2014 all the credits they want \u2014 but they have to be able to do it.\nSo the economy is doing fantastically well.\u00a0 We want to vote on USMCA.\u00a0 We have other trade deals that we\u2019ve done.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done South Korea, which is a fantastic deal for us; it turned out even better than we thought.\u00a0 South Korea was a terrible deal.\u00a0 The person in charge of that particular deal, Hillary Clinton \u2014 you\u2019ve heard of her; she\u2019s the one that\u2019s accusing everybody of being a Russian agent.\u00a0 Anybody that is opposed to her is a Russian agent.\u00a0 So that\u2019s a scam that was pretty much put down.\nTulsi \u2014 I don\u2019t know Tulsi, but she\u2019s not a Russian agent.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know Jill Stein.\u00a0 I know she likes environment.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think she likes Russians.\u00a0 If she does like them, I know she\u2019s not a asset.\u00a0 She called her an \u201casset\u201d of Russia.\u00a0 These people are sick.\u00a0 There\u2019s something wrong with them.\nBut I think that Tulsi Gabbard probably got helped quite a bit by this stir.\u00a0 I think we were helped because it shows, for two and half years, we end up winning.\u00a0 I had to go through two and a half years.\u00a0 If she would have done this earlier, people would have realized what a scam it is.\u00a0 Everybody is a Russian or a Russian agent or a Russian asset.\nThe economy, again, is at a level that it\u2019s never been.\u00a0 We are doing \u2014 whether it\u2019s household income, whether it\u2019s almost any chart \u2014 and I think maybe the best of all is unemployment.\u00a0 Unemployment has reached historic lows.\u00a0 African American, Asian American, Hispanic American reached numbers that nobody ever thought would be possible.\u00a0 Had the lowest ever in history.\nSo, if you\u2019re black, if you\u2019re Hispanic, if you\u2019re Asian \u2014 anybody \u2014 African American, Hispanic American, Asian: the lowest in history.\u00a0 For women, the lowest in 71 years.\u00a0 The best.\u00a0 When I say \u201clowest,\u201d I\u2019m talking about the best.\u00a0 Both the best unemployment numbers and the best employment numbers \u2014 either way you want to cut it.\u00a0 You can say them both because it\u2019s best in both.\nAs far as employment is concerned, we have the most people working today than ever before in the history of our country.\u00a0 We\u2019ve never had \u2014 there\u2019s close to 160 million people.\u00a0 So it\u2019s \u2014 some incredible things are happening.\nSyria: We will be giving a much fuller report.\u00a0 Mike Pompeo, Secretary of Defense Esper, and the different people that are very much involved.\u00a0 Mike Pence, Vice President.\nWe are having very good news coming out.\u00a0 The ceasefire is holding.\u00a0 The Kurds are moving out to safer areas beyond the \u201csafe zone,\u201d as we call it.\u00a0 Having the safe zone is not a bad thing; it\u2019s a good thing.\u00a0 And plenty of Turks have been killed because of conflict on their border.\u00a0 So, you know, you have to look at it both ways.\u00a0 But the ceasefire is absolutely holding.\u00a0 There\u2019s been skirmishes, but very little, relatively speaking.\u00a0 Of course, if you watch the fake news, it\u2019s like pretty \u2014 pretty wild.\u00a0 It\u2019s really holding.\nI\u2019ve watched these pundits that have been working on this thing for 20 years.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been working on the Middle East for 20 years; they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing and they\u2019re telling me what to do.\u00a0 They\u2019re saying, \u201cWhat did Trump get out of it?\u00a0 What did he get out of it?\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019ll tell you what I get out of it: We won\u2019t be fighting, and we\u2019ll bring our soldiers back home.\u00a0 They were supposed to be there for 30 days, and they\u2019ve been there now for 10 years, in Syria.\u00a0 Ten years.\u00a0 They were supposed to go in, do a quick hit on ISIS, and come out.\nNow, as far as ISIS is concerned, when I took over \u2014 November, 2016 \u2014 ISIS was all over the place.\u00a0 I\u2019m the one \u2014 meaning it was me and this administration, working with others, including the Kurds \u2014 that captured all of these people that we\u2019re talking about right now.\nBecause President Obama \u2014 it was a mess.\u00a0 And I was told and you were told, and everybody told it would be years before you ever did what I did in about a month and a half after I started.\u00a0 I went over to Iraq, I met with our generals, and we figured out a plan, and it was done within a month and a half.\u00a0 I\u2019m the one that did the capturing.\u00a0 I\u2019m the one that knows more about it than you people or the \u2014 or the fake pundits.\nBut I sort of have to smile to myself.\u00a0 I was telling a couple of people \u2014 I\u2019m watching these people that I\u2019ve been watching for 20 years.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been watching the same faces; they\u2019re just a little bit older and a little bit grayer.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been watching them for 20 years, saying about the Middle East.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve been wrong on everything they\u2019ve ever said.\nAnd now, all of a sudden, people are starting to say, \u201cYou know, what Trump is doing is great.\u201d\u00a0 And we have tremendous \u2014 a tremendous power.\u00a0 Because since the election of 2016, November \u2014 since that beautiful day, our country has picked up in value trillions and trillions of dollars of worth.\u00a0 Trillions and trillions of dollars.\u00a0 Numbers that nobody would believe.\u00a0 Numbers, if I would have said it on the campaign trail, I would\u2019ve been \u2014 I would\u2019ve been excoriated by the fake media.\u00a0 Excoriated.\nThe numbers are far greater than anything that even I predicted.\u00a0 You hear that with the household median income.\u00a0 Four hundred dollars for eight years.\u00a0 Nine hundred and seventy-five dollars for eight years.\u00a0 Seven thousand dollars for two and half years \u2014 up.\u00a0 Nobody has ever seen numbers.\nLarry Kudlow is going to speak in a minute, and he\u2019s going to tell you that\u2019s one of the greatest strengths of our country.\nAnd, by the way, other areas and countries are doing poorly.\u00a0 Europe is doing very poorly.\u00a0 Asia is doing very poorly.\u00a0 China is doing very poorly \u2014 worst year they\u2019ve had in 57 years.\u00a0 I wonder why.\u00a0 I wonder why.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure you can\u2019t figure it out.\nAnd we\u2019re doing great.\u00a0 We\u2019re taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China, and they\u2019re eating the tariffs because they devalued their currency.\u00a0 And they\u2019re pouring money into their economy because they don\u2019t want to lose the jobs, but they are losing the jobs.\u00a0 They\u2019ve having a terrible year.\u00a0 Worst in 57 years, they say.\nAnd if they say that, it means it\u2019s worse.\u00a0 And they announced that they have the worst numbers they\u2019ve had in 20 years.\u00a0 They announced six.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s six; I think it\u2019s probably minus-something.\u00a0 It could very well be minus.\u00a0 It could very well be in negative territory.\nBut we\u2019re doing great.\u00a0 And, by the way, the deal with China is coming along very well.\u00a0 They want to make a deal because they sort of have to make a deal, I think.\u00a0 They have to make a deal because their supply chain is going down the tubes.\u00a0 Their supply chain is broken like you\u2019ve never seen anything broken before.\u00a0 It\u2019s broken.\nSo, our soldiers \u2014 on Syria, they\u2019re moving out, very nicely.\u00a0 ISIS is being held by the Kurds.\u00a0 And I have an absolute commitment from Turkey that they\u2019re watching them, just in case.\u00a0 So we have a double: We have the Kurds are watching them.\nAs you know, most of the ISIS fighters that we captured \u2014 \u201cwe.\u201d\u00a0 We.\u00a0 Not Obama.\u00a0 We.\u00a0 We captured them.\u00a0 Me.\u00a0 Our country captured them, working with others, including the Kurds.\u00a0 And we helped them, don\u2019t forget.\u00a0 We helped the Kurds.\u00a0 Everyone said the Kurds helped us; that\u2019s true.\u00a0 But we helped the Kurds.\u00a0 They\u2019re no angels, but we helped the Kurds.\nAnd we never gave the Kurds a commitment that we\u2019d stay for the next 400 years and protect them.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been fighting with the Turks for 300 years, that people know of.\u00a0 And nobody ever committed, \u201cGee, if you do this, we\u2019re going to do that, and we\u2019re going to stay with you forever.\u201d\u00a0 Nobody ever said that.\nBut when I watch these pundits that always are trying to take a shot, I say \u2014 they say, \u201cWhat are we getting out of it?\u201d\u00a0 You know what we\u2019re getting out of it?\u00a0 We\u2019re bringing our soldiers back home.\u00a0 That\u2019s a big thing.\u00a0 And it\u2019s going to probably work.\u00a0 But if it doesn\u2019t work, you\u2019re going to have people fighting like they\u2019ve been fighting for 300 years.\u00a0 It\u2019s very simple.\u00a0 It\u2019s really very, very simple.\nBut we\u2019re going to bring our soldiers back home.\u00a0 So far, there hasn\u2019t been one drop of blood shed during this whole period by an American soldier.\u00a0 Nobody was killed.\u00a0 Nobody cut their finger.\u00a0 There\u2019s been nothing.\u00a0 And they\u2019re leaving rather, I think, not expeditiously \u2014 rather intelligently.\u00a0 Just leaving.\u00a0 Leaving certain areas.\u00a0 Leaving.\nWe\u2019ve secured the oil.\u00a0 If you remember, I didn\u2019t want to go into Iraq.\u00a0 I was a civilian, so I had no power over it.\u00a0 But I always was speaking against going into Iraq.\u00a0 It was not a great decision.\u00a0 But I always said, \u201cIf you\u2019re going in, keep the oil.\u201d\u00a0 Same thing here: Keep the oil.\u00a0 We want to keep the oil.\nAnd we\u2019ll work something out with the Kurds so that they have some money, they have some cash flow.\u00a0 Maybe we\u2019ll get one of our big oil companies to go in and do it properly.\u00a0 But they\u2019ll have some cash flow, which they basically don\u2019t have right now.\u00a0 Everybody is fighting.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a big oil area, but everybody is fighting for whatever there is.\u00a0 So we have a lot of good things going over there, and they\u2019re going very well.\nAs far as the continuation of the witch hunt, we beat the Russian deal.\u00a0 We beat the Mueller deal.\u00a0 Now I find out, as I said before, that they\u2019re trying to make other people into Russian agents, Russian assets.\u00a0 It has no credibility.\nNow they have what should be extremely easy to beat, because I have a perfect phone call.\u00a0 I made a perfect call \u2014 not a good call; a perfect call.\u00a0 In fact, a friend of mine, who\u2019s a great lawyer, said, \u201cDid you know this would be the subject of all of this scrutiny?\u00a0 Because the way you expressed yourself, this is like a perfect call.\u00a0 You must\u2019ve known this was going to happen.\u201d\u00a0 No, I didn\u2019t.\u00a0 That\u2019s just the way I talk to the President of Ukraine \u2014 who, by the way, said there was no pressure, there was no blackmail, there was no anything.\nAnd Congressman Hurd \u2014 I have to tell you, yesterday, he was great.\u00a0 He was great, what he said.\u00a0 I gained a lot of respect for him very quickly, because he said, \u201cYou know, with all of this going on, I haven\u2019t heard one Ukrainian saying there was pressure.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t heard one Ukrainian \u2014 not one \u2014 say that there was pressure of any kind.\u201d\u00a0 There haven\u2019t even been reports of it to our people.\u00a0 Nobody has even said it.\u00a0 And the reason you haven\u2019t heard it \u2014 because there is no pressure.\nThe conversation I had was perfect.\u00a0 And what happened is I released the conversation, and that threw Shifty Schiff off.\u00a0 Crooked \u2014 he was a corrupt politician.\u00a0 Schiff is a corrupt politician.\u00a0 That threw him off because he made up a lie.\u00a0 He made up what I said in my conversation.\u00a0 And he went before the United States Congress, and he said a made-up story; it was fabricated.\u00a0 He totally fabricated it.\u00a0 They said he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s a screenwriter.\u00a0 Well, this was screenwritten.\u00a0 It was a fabricated story.\nSo he made up a lie, and I released \u2014 they never thought that I\u2019d do this \u2014 I released a transcription, done by stenographers, of the exact conversation I had.\u00a0 And now, the game was up.\nAnd the other thing is, the whistleblower and the other whistleblower and the informer \u2014 all these people \u2014 they\u2019d seemed to have disappeared.\u00a0 You know why they disappeared?\u00a0 Because they talked about another conversation \u2014 a conversation that I never had.\u00a0 They made up a conversation.\nNow, if you look at the whistleblower report and you look at the actual transcribed conversation \u2014 the actual conversation that I had \u2014 and you couple that with the President saying that that was a perfectly fine conversation \u2014 I don\u2019t even know \u2014 he didn\u2019t even know what they\u2019re doing.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t even know about the money not being paid.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 I think that came out somewhere, that the money \u2014 he didn\u2019t know that.\u00a0 Then you also have his foreign minister saying, \u201cNo, it was a very good conversation.\u201d\u00a0 There was no anything asked for.\u00a0 There was no pressure whatsoever.\nSo this is a phony investigation.\u00a0 I watched a couple of people on television today talking about it.\u00a0 They were talking about what a phony deal it is, what a phony investigation it is.\u00a0 And Republicans have to get tougher and fight.\u00a0 We have some that are great fighters, but they have to get tougher and fight because the Democrats are trying to hurt the Republican Party for the election, which is coming up, where we\u2019re doing very well.\u00a0 We had a record crowd \u2014 the history of the arena \u2014 it\u2019s the biggest crowd they\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 And we had 20,000 people outside, at least.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing great on the election.\nYou saw what happened in North Carolina.\u00a0 We picked up two seats that people didn\u2019t think we were going to pick up.\u00a0 That was two weeks ago.\u00a0 Last week, a Governor that people thought was okay went down, and now he\u2019s got a big election.\u00a0 He was under 50 percent; nobody thought that was going to happen.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing very well.\nBut a lot of these stories that are made up, between a guy like Shifty Schiff \u2014 who\u2019s a phony guy, a corrupt politician \u2014 the media buys it.\u00a0 Because, unfortunately, the media is corrupt also.\u00a0 Much of the media \u2014 so much of it, such a big percentage of it.\u00a0 It\u2019s such a shame.\u00a0 Some great reporters and great journalists, but some really bad people.\u00a0 So, that\u2019s the story.\nThe economy is good.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing well with getting out, finally, after 10 years.\u00a0 Again, 30 days to 10 years.\u00a0 And we\u2019re getting out.\u00a0 Nobody \u2014 none of our people are injured.\u00a0 It\u2019s very smooth thus far.\u00a0 And I think that you\u2019re going to see something that\u2019s going to be good.\nRemember this: If Turkey misbehaves \u2014 I don\u2019t think they will \u2014 but we have a power that nobody thought we had, to the extent.\u00a0 It\u2019s called sanctions.\u00a0 It\u2019s called tariffs.\u00a0 We\u2019ll tariff the hell out of their product coming here.\u00a0 They send tremendous amounts of steel to the United States and other things.\u00a0 We will tariff them and we will sanction them.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t want to use that as a threat because Mike Pence and our Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, they went out and they negotiated a very good five-day ceasefire.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure if we needed a little extension, that would be happening.\u00a0 But our power is \u2014 our power of economics, it\u2019s very powerful.\nWe\u2019ve rebuilt the military since November of 2016.\u00a0 Our military was totally depleted from being in stupid situations like this for so many years.\u00a0 Our military was depleted to a level that we had very little ammunition.\u00a0 I was actually told we had no ammunition.\u00a0 Now we have more ammunition than we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 Our military is stronger \u2014 stronger than it\u2019s ever been.\u00a0 Probably stronger than ever.\u00a0 And in a few short months, as the equipment pours in from the money we spent \u2014 two and a half trillion dollars \u2014 it will be at a level that it\u2019s never even come close to.\u00a0 It\u2019s a big difference.\u00a0 All made in the USA.\u00a0 All made in the USA.\nSo, we\u2019re doing very well.\u00a0 And if anybody has any questions?\u00a0 Please.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, will you maintain a limited number of troops in Syria?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Excuse me?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Will you maintain a limited number of troops in Syria?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be necessary.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to leave troops there.\u00a0 It\u2019s very dangerous there.\u00a0 You know, we had 28 troops, as it turned out.\u00a0 People said 50; it was 28.\u00a0 And you had an army on both sides of those troops.\u00a0 Those troops would\u2019ve been wiped out.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary other than that we secured the oil in a little different section, but we did secure the oil.\nAnd the other reason \u2014 region where we\u2019ve been asked by Israel and Jordan to leave a small number of troops is a totally different section of Syria, near Jordan and close to Israel.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a totally different section.\u00a0 That\u2019s a totally different mindset.\u00a0 So we have a small group there, and we\u2019ve secured the oil.\u00a0 Other than that, there\u2019s no reason for it, in our opinion.\nAnd, again, the Kurds are going to be watching.\u00a0 We\u2019re working with the Kurds.\u00a0 We have a good relationship with the Kurds.\u00a0 But we never agreed to, you know, protect the Kurds.\u00a0 We fought with them for three and a half to four years.\u00a0 We never agreed to protect the Kurds for the rest of their lives.\nRemember this: When Iraq was fighting the Kurds, everybody thought we were going to fight with the Kurds.\u00a0 I said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s a little strange that we\u2019re fighting with the Kurds when we just spent $4 trillion on Iraq and now we\u2019re going to be fighting Iraq.\u201d\u00a0 So what I did is I said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to take a position.\u00a0 Let them fight themselves.\u201d\u00a0 I thought the Kurds would do very well.\u00a0 Everyone said, \u201cOh, the Kurds will do very well.\u201d\u00a0 Well, Iraq moved in and the Kurds left.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t fight because they didn\u2019t have us to fight with.\nA lot of people are good when they fight with us.\u00a0 You know, when you have $10 billion worth of airplanes shooting 10 miles in front of your line, it\u2019s much easier to fight.\u00a0 But with that, they were a good help.\u00a0 But we were a great help to them too.\u00a0 They were fighting ISIS.\u00a0 You know, they hated ISIS,\u00a0so they were fighting ISIS.\u00a0 But we never agreed.\u00a0 Where\u2019s an agreement that said we have to stay in the Middle East for the rest of humanity, for the rest of civilization, to protect the Kurds?\u00a0 They never said that.\nAnd we have protected them.\u00a0 We\u2019ve taken very good care of them.\u00a0 And I hope they\u2019re going to watch over ISIS, because that\u2019s \u2014 again, most of it is not in the safe zone, as we call it.\u00a0 Some places are called \u201cdemilitarized zone.\u201d\u00a0 In the old days, we\u2019d call areas like this a \u201cdemilitarized zone.\u201d\nAnd our relationship with the Kurds is good, and they\u2019re going to be safe.\u00a0 And I will say this: If shooting didn\u2019t start for a couple of days, I don\u2019t think the Kurds would have moved.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think, frankly, you would\u2019ve been able to make a very easy deal with Turkey.\nI think when it started for a few days, it was so nasty that when we went to Turkey and when we went to the Kurds, they agreed to do things that they never would have done before the shooting started.\nIf they didn\u2019t go through two and a half days of hell, I don\u2019t think they would\u2019ve done it.\u00a0 I think you couldn\u2019t have made a deal.\u00a0 And people have been trying to make this deal for years.\u00a0 But we\u2019re close to making it.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see what happens.\u00a0 Again, they\u2019ve been fighting for 300 years, that we know of.\u00a0 Three hundred years.\u00a0 So why should we put our soldiers in the midst of two large groups, hundreds of thousands, potentially, of people that are fighting?\u00a0 I don\u2019t think so.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think so.\nYes, Steve?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You said that Republicans need to get tougher and fight.\u00a0 What are you talking about, Mr. President?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I think the Democrats fight dirty.\u00a0 I think the Democrats are lousy politicians with lousy policy.\u00a0 They want open borders.\u00a0 They don\u2019t care about crime.\u00a0 They want sanctuary cities.\u00a0 They don\u2019t care about drugs.\u00a0 They don\u2019t care about almost anything.\u00a0 They don\u2019t care about USMCA. \u00a0How about that?\nI think they\u2019re lousy politicians.\u00a0 But two things they have: They\u2019re vicious and they stick together.\u00a0 They don\u2019t have Mitt Romney in their midst.\u00a0 They don\u2019t have people like that.\u00a0 They stick together.\u00a0 You never see them break off.\u00a0 You never see somebody go out and \u2014 that\u2019s why I respected so much what I watched with Will Hurd today, because he was one of the few that didn\u2019t seem to be there and yet he made a statement, and he said, \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t seen any complaints whatsoever from the Ukrainians.\u201d\u00a0 I mean, the Ukrainians didn\u2019t complain, and they didn\u2019t tell any of our ambassadors.\nThis thing is all about a letter that was perfect.\u00a0 You never hear the letter anymore.\u00a0 It was all about whistleblowers.\u00a0 You never hear \u2014 what happened to the whistleblowers?\u00a0 They\u2019re gone, because they\u2019ve been discredited.\u00a0 What happened to the informant?\u00a0 And where\u2019s the IG?\u00a0 Why didn\u2019t the IG read the letter, read the transcript \u2014 he could have gotten it, I guess, I assume.\u00a0 I would have declassified it for him, if I had to do that.\u00a0 Why didn\u2019t he read this and then see that the whistleblower\u2019s account was totally different than the letter?\u00a0 Then he would\u2019ve said, \u201cOh, there\u2019s no problem here.\u201d\u00a0 The whistleblower gave a false account.\nNow you have to say, \u201cWell, do we have to protect somebody that gave a false account?\u201d\u00a0 You know, these whistleblowers, they have them like they\u2019re angels.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 So do we have to protect somebody that gave a totally false account of my conversation?\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 You tell me.\u00a0 Do we have to protect the informant?\u00a0 Now, I happen to think there probably wasn\u2019t an informant.\u00a0 You know, the informant went to the whistleblower, the whistleblower had second- and third-hand information.\u00a0 You remember that.\u00a0 It was a big problem.\nBut the information was wrong.\u00a0 So was there actually an informant?\u00a0 Maybe the informant was Schiff.\u00a0 It could be Shifty Schiff.\u00a0 In my opinion, it\u2019s possibly Schiff.\u00a0 Why didn\u2019t Schiff say that he and his staff, or his staff, or a whole group \u2014 why didn\u2019t he say that he met with the whistleblower?\u00a0 He knew all about the whistleblower.\u00a0 Why didn\u2019t he say?\nHe\u2019s a crooked politician.\u00a0 Very bad for our country.\u00a0 This whole thing is very bad for our country.\u00a0 In the midst of that, I\u2019m trying to get out of wars.\u00a0 But we may have to get into wars too.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 We may have to get into wars.\u00a0 We\u2019re better prepared than we\u2019ve ever been.\u00a0 If Iran does something, they\u2019ll be hit like they\u2019ve never been hit before.\u00a0 I mean, we have things that we\u2019re looking at.\nBut can you imagine\u00a0I have to fight off these \u2014 these lowlives at the same time I\u2019m negotiating these very important things that should\u2019ve been done during Obama and Bush and even before that.\u00a0 All right?\u00a0 So that\u2019s where we are right now.\nActually\u00a0 very fair question.\nGo ahead.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, will the troops from Syria come home, or will you send them to other military bases?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, they\u2019re going to be sent initially to different parts, get prepared, and then ultimately we\u2019re bringing them home.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 We\u2019re bringing our troops back home.\u00a0 I got elected on bringing our soldiers back home.\u00a0 Now, it\u2019s not very popular within the Beltway, because, you know, Lockheed doesn\u2019t like it, and these great military companies don\u2019t like it.\u00a0 It\u2019s not very popular.\nOutside the Beltway \u2014 my largest cheer in Dallas \u2014 I had 25,000 people \u2014 close \u2014 in that arena.\u00a0 A record crowd.\u00a0 I had so many people outside of the arena.\u00a0 Thousands.\u00a0 My largest cheer that night was two things: We\u2019re building the wall; that\u2019s number one.\u00a0 And number two, and probably tied for number one, was we\u2019re bringing our soldiers back home.\u00a0 That was our largest cheer in Dallas.\u00a0 Great place.\u00a0 Great state \u2014 Texas.\u00a0 Tough state.\u00a0 They\u2019re tough.\nWhen I said, \u201cWe\u2019re bringing our soldiers back home,\u201d the place went crazy.\u00a0 But within the Beltway, you know, people don\u2019t like it.\u00a0 It\u2019s much tougher for me.\u00a0 It\u2019d be much easier for me to let our soldiers be there, let them continue to die.\u00a0 I go out to Dover and I have to \u2014 I meet parents.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a pleasant thing; it\u2019s the most unpleasant thing I do.\u00a0 Most unpleasant thing I do.\u00a0 When I see that big cargo plane open, and I see those coffins get rolled off, or when I go over to Walter Reed Hospital \u2014 where the doctors are incredible, by the way \u2014 saving people that could\u2019ve never been saved even five years ago.\u00a0 You know that.\u00a0 But those people are horribly wounded.\u00a0 Horribly, horribly wounded.\u00a0 Wounded warriors.\u00a0 It\u2019s the toughest thing I do.\nThe toughest thing is sending letters.\u00a0 I send many letters home to parents, and I speak to parents.\u00a0 But I send many letters home to parents; their son or daughter has been killed over in the Middle East.\u00a0 For what?\u00a0 For what?\u00a0 There are times to fight and there are times not to fight.\u00a0 There are times to be smart.\nWe have tremendous economic power, and we\u2019re using our economic power \u2014 much more powerful, in certain ways, than playing with \u2014 with guns.\u00a0 And much better for our country, and much better for everybody, and actually much better for humanity.\u00a0 Okay?\nThank you all very much.\u00a0 I appreciate it.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, on your decision to not hold the G7 \u2014 the G7 not at Doral?\u00a0 Are you planning to do it at Camp David now?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Doral \u2014 Doral was a very simple situation: I own a property in Florida.\u00a0 I was going to do it at no cost, or give it free, if I got a ruling, because there\u2019s a question as to whether or not you\u2019re allowed to give it because it\u2019s like a contribution to a country.\u00a0 I\u2019d have to get a ruling.\u00a0 But I would have given it for nothing.\u00a0 It\u2019s a lot of \u2014 a lot of money I would have given away, like I give away my salary.\u00a0 I give away my salary.\u00a0 It\u2019s, I guess, close to $450,000.\u00a0 I give it away.\u00a0 Nobody ever said he gives away his salary.\u00a0 Now it comes up because of this.\u00a0 But I give away my presidential salary.\nThey say that no other President has done it.\u00a0 I\u2019m surprised, to be honest with you.\u00a0 They actually say that George Washington may have been the only other President that did.\u00a0 But see whether or not Obama gave up his salary.\u00a0 See whether or not all of the other of your favorites give up their salary.\u00a0 The answer is no.\nThey say it\u2019s the only one.\u00a0 They think George Washington did, but they say no other.\u00a0 So I give up \u2014 it\u2019s a lot of money, $450,000, close to.\u00a0 And I give that up.\nSo I have a place that\u2019s in the best location.\u00a0 I\u2019m very good at real estate.\u00a0 Very, very good.\u00a0 Much better than you even understand.\u00a0 When you see my financials, which I\u2019ll give at the right time, you\u2019ll say, \u201cMan, he was much better than we even thought.\u201d\u00a0 This guy knows, right here \u2014 Mnuchin \u2014 because he was in the private sector.\u00a0 He knows \u2014 he knows very much what I have.\u00a0 He would tell you.\u00a0 Someday, maybe, he\u2019ll tell you.\nBut I\u2019m very good at real estate.\u00a0 There\u2019s Miami \u2014 this facility.\u00a0 Everybody would have had their own building.\u00a0 Everybody in the G7 would have had their own building.\u00a0 It was so good.\u00a0 Florida loved it.\u00a0 They love economic development.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not because \u2014 it\u2019s a beautiful place, it\u2019s new, it\u2019s been totally rebuilt.\u00a0 It\u2019s new.\u00a0 Everything is new.\u00a0 It\u2019s got massive meeting rooms.\u00a0 Unlimited for security because it\u2019s on, you know, hundreds of acres.\u00a0 Best location.\u00a0 Right next to the airport, Miami International \u2014 one of the biggest airports in the world.\u00a0 Some people say it\u2019s the biggest.\u00a0 But one of the biggest airports in the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s only minutes away.\u00a0 It would\u2019ve been great.\nBut the Democrats went crazy, even though I would\u2019ve done it free, saved the country a lot of money.\u00a0 Then they say, \u201cOh, but you\u2019ll get promotion.\u201d\u00a0 Who cares?\u00a0 You don\u2019t think I get enough promotion?\u00a0 I get more promotion than any human being that\u2019s ever lived, I think, I get.\u00a0 I think I would have that \u2014 I think I can say that fairly safely.\u00a0 I think I get more promotion than any human being that\u2019s ever lived \u2014 some good, some bad.\u00a0 The people that like me give me only good.\u00a0 The people that don\u2019t like me give me only bad.\u00a0 But that\u2019s the way life is.\u00a0 I don\u2019t need promotion.\u00a0 I don\u2019t need promotion.\u00a0 Okay?\nBut I was willing to do this for free.\u00a0 And they would\u2019ve had \u2014 it would\u2019ve been the greatest G7 ever.\u00a0 And I would\u2019ve said to my family \u2014 because they run my business now; I don\u2019t run my business.\u00a0 I actually put all the stuff in trusts.\u00a0 They run my \u2014 and I didn\u2019t have to do that.\u00a0 I was under no obligation to do it.\nYou know, I don\u2019t know if you know it: George Washington \u2014 he ran his business simultaneously while he was President.\u00a0 Many other Presidents \u2014 there weren\u2019t too many really rich Presidents, but there were a few \u2014 they ran their business.\u00a0 Hey, Obama made a deal for a book.\u00a0 Is that running a business?\u00a0 I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t even discuss it while he was President.\u00a0 Oh, yeah.\u00a0 He has a deal with Netflix.\u00a0 When did they start talking about that?\u00a0 That\u2019s only, you know, a couple of examples.\nBut other Presidents, if you look \u2014 other Presidents were wealthy.\u00a0 Not huge wealth.\u00a0 George Washington was actually considered a very, very rich man at the time.\u00a0 But they ran their businesses.\u00a0 George Washington, they say, had two desks: He had a presidential desk and a business desk.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think you people, with this phony emoluments clause \u2014\nAnd, by the way, I would say that it\u2019s cost me anywhere from $2 [billion] to $5 billion to be President \u2014 and that\u2019s okay \u2014 between what I lose and what I could have made.\u00a0 I would have made a fortune if I just ran my business.\u00a0 I was doing it really well.\u00a0 I have a great business.\u00a0 I have the best properties.\nBut between what I lose \u2014 and, in all fairness, some properties \u2014 Doral is an example.\u00a0 Doral was setting records when I bought it, because I owned it for a period of time.\u00a0 Setting records.\u00a0 It was going to \u2014 there was nothing like it.\u00a0 It was making a fortune.\nAnd then what happened?\u00a0 I announced I\u2019m going to run for office.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 And all of a sudden \u2014\u00a0and I say, \u201cWe got to build a wall, we got to have borders, we got to have this, we got to have that.\u201d\u00a0 All of a sudden, people \u2014 some people didn\u2019t like it.\u00a0 They thought the rhetoric was too tough.\u00a0 And it went from doing great to doing fine.\u00a0 It does very nicely now.\u00a0 It\u2019s actually back, I understand, very strongly.\nBut Doral was setting records.\u00a0 And I knew this would happen.\u00a0 Most of the stuff that I have \u2014 because now, instead of having 100 percent of the market that loves you and they love your brand and it\u2019s luxury and it\u2019s great, now you have 50 percent of the market.\u00a0 That\u2019s called politics.\u00a0 I fully understood that.\nSo it\u2019s cost me between $2 billion and $5 billion.\u00a0 And if I had it to do again, I\u2019d do it in an instant.\u00a0 Because who cares?\u00a0 If you can afford it, what difference does it make?\u00a0 If I had this to do again \u2014 because I\u2019m making a big difference for the country.\nThe country is stronger now than it\u2019s been in many years \u2014 maybe ever.\u00a0 Out military is rebuilt. \u00a0Our economy is hitting records.\u00a0 As I said, best unemployment numbers, best employment numbers.\u00a0 We\u2019re strong.\u00a0 We\u2019re bringing our soldiers back home from the endless wars.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing great.\nSo whether I lost $2 billion, $5 billion, more or less, it doesn\u2019t make any difference to me.\u00a0 I don\u2019t care.\u00a0 If you\u2019re rich, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0 I\u2019m doing this for the country.\u00a0 I\u2019m doing it for the people that show up.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t had an empty seat at a rally.\u00a0 I will say, \u201cWhere\u2019s the rally?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s in a certain place.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cOkay.\u00a0 Just get the biggest arena.\u201d\nI go to these massive basketball arenas, like in Dallas, where the Mavericks play, and fill it up and set a record.\u00a0 I\u2019ve set a record in almost every place I\u2019ve been because we just need a little small stage.\u00a0 We don\u2019t need basketball courts, ice hockey courts.\u00a0 And I take less than musicians, because they have bands.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have band.\u00a0 I set the world record for somebody without a guitar.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 I don\u2019t have bands.\u00a0 All right?\nSo that\u2019s the story.\u00a0 And, you know, those people are the poll.\u00a0 And I had great polls.\u00a0 I have my best polls now.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s because people think that it\u2019s terrible what they\u2019re doing.\u00a0 Pelosi, Shifty Schiff, Schumer \u2014 these people are trying to destroy the country.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very bad thing, what they\u2019re doing.\nThe President of the United States should be allowed to run the country, not have to focus on this kind of crap, while at the same time doing a great job with Syria and Turkey and all of the other things that we\u2019re doing.\nKorea \u2014 okay, maybe someday \u2014 but I\u2019ll tell you what: If somebody else became President, with that same mindset that they had, you\u2019d, right now, be in a big war with North Korea.\u00a0 You don\u2019t hear too much about it.\u00a0 It could happen.\u00a0 Could happen.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I always say, \u201cWho knows?\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s deals.\u00a0 Who knows?\nBut, in the meantime, North Korea is \u2014 I like Kim; he likes me.\u00a0 We get along.\u00a0 I respect him; he respects him.\u00a0 You could end up in a war.\u00a0 President Obama told me that.\u00a0 He said, \u201cThe biggest problem \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to solve it.\u201d\u00a0 He told me doesn\u2019t know how to solve it.\u00a0 I said, \u201cDid you ever call him?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0 Actually, he tried 11 times.\u00a0 But the man on the other side \u2014 the gentleman on the side did not take his call.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 Lack of respect.\u00a0 But he takes my call.\nThank you very much, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, the G7 \u2014 so what\u2019s the plan for the G7 now, if it\u2019s not at Doral?\u00a0 What\u2019s the plan for the G7 now?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We\u2019ll look at other locations.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be as exciting.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be as good.\u00a0 It\u2019ll cost the country a fortune because it\u2019s very expensive.\nI know France had a budget of many, many millions of dollars.\u00a0 They just did it.\u00a0 They did a great job, by the way.\u00a0 But France had a budget of many, many millions of dollars.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to cost, you know, a fortune for the country.\u00a0 I was willing to do it for free, but people didn\u2019t like that.\u00a0 They thought I may get some promotional value.\u00a0 I need promotional value so badly, right?\u00a0 I don\u2019t need promotion.\nGo ahead.\u00a0 What did you say?\u00a0 What else?\u00a0 Steve?\u00a0 No?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, could I ask you about Iran?\u00a0 Sir.\u00a0 Sir, on Iran \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, is it a forgone conclusion that the House will impeach you?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 On Iran, what?\u00a0 Say it?\u00a0 What?\u00a0 What do you mention the word \u201cimpeach\u201d?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, do you believe \u2014 do you believe it\u2019s a forgone \u2014 do believe that it\u2019s a forgone conclusion that the House will impeach?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I think they want to.\u00a0 Any Democrat wants to because they\u2019re not going to beat me in the election.\u00a0 So, of course, they want to impeach me.\u00a0 Why wouldn\u2019t they want to impeach me?\u00a0 It\u2019s so \u2014 it\u2019s so illegitimate.\u00a0 It cannot be the way the Founders \u2014 our great Founders \u2014 meant this to be.\nBut I see this guy, Congressman Al Green, saying, \u201cWe have to impeach him, otherwise he\u2019s going to win the election.\u201d\u00a0 What\u2019s that all about?\u00a0 But that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re saying.\u00a0 \u201cWe have to impeach because otherwise he\u2019s going to win.\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019m going to win the election.\nLook, I have the strongest economy ever.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 I have the strongest economy in the history of our country.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 And we\u2019re setting records.\u00a0 Over 100 times \u2014 I think it\u2019s like 118 \u2014 but over 100 times, we\u2019ve had the highest stock market in history, since November 8th.\u00a0 Over 100 times.\nAnd, by the way, the day I got elected \u2014 the following day \u2014 from there until January 20th, the market went through the roof.\u00a0 You know why it went through the roof?\u00a0 Because they got rid of Obama and they got rid of Clinton.\u00a0 And if anybody else \u2014 if any of these people that I\u2019ve been watching on this stage got elected, your 401(k)s would be down the tubes.\u00a0 They\u2019d go down not 20 percent or 30 percent; they\u2019d go down 70, 90, 80 [percent], and destroy this country.\u00a0 You\u2019d destroy the country.\nSo, I think they want to impeach me because it\u2019s the only way they\u2019re going to win.\u00a0 They\u2019ve got nothing.\u00a0 All they have is a phone call that was perfect.\u00a0 All they have is a whistleblower who has disappeared.\u00a0 Where is he?\u00a0 He\u2019s gone.\u00a0 Then they have a second whistleblower.\u00a0 \u201cThe second whistleblower has got \u2014 oh, it\u2019s going to\u2026\u201d\u00a0 Where is he?\u00a0 He disappeared.\u00a0 Then they have an informant.\u00a0 \u201cOh, the informant is\u2026\u201d\u00a0 Where is he?\nThey\u2019re interviewing \u2014 they\u2019re interviewing ambassadors who I\u2019d never heard of.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know who these people are.\u00a0 I never heard of them.\u00a0 And I have great respect for some of them.\u00a0 One of them said, just recently \u2014 a very, very highly respected man \u2014 I\u2019m not going to get into their names, but a highly \u2014 said, \u201cNo, no.\u00a0 We were very, very bothered by Joe Biden and his son back during the Obama administration.\u201d\u00a0 He said, \u201cWe were very\u2026\u201d\u00a0 He\u2019s supposed to be their witness.\nDon\u2019t forget, many of these people were put there during Obama, during Clinton, during the Never Trump or Bush era.\u00a0 You know, you had a Never Trump or Bush.\u00a0 You have heard of those?\u00a0 Those people might be worse than the Democrats \u2014 the Never Trumpers.\u00a0 The good news is they\u2019re dying off fast.\u00a0 They\u2019re on artificial respiration, I think.\nBut, no, impeachment \u2014 they want to impeach and they want to do it as quick as possible.\u00a0 And that\u2019s pretty much the story.\u00a0 Okay?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What about Republican support?\u00a0 Do you \u2014 are you working behind the scenes to shore up support in the Senate?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think I have great Republican support.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you run the risk of alienating any of the Republicans in your Party?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I don\u2019t think so at all.\u00a0 No, they \u2014 because, you know what?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some of them are very angry about the Syria decision.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Look \u2014 no, you don\u2019t \u2014 I have to do what I have to do.\u00a0 I\u2019ll tell you what: I want to bring our soldiers back home.\u00a0 If people want to leave them there, I\u2019ll take that every day.\u00a0 All I know \u2014 you were at Dallas \u2014 all I know is the place went crazy when I said, \u201cWe\u2019re bringing our soldiers back home.\u201d\u00a0 Within this little area \u2014 this is a very unique area \u2014 they may feel that.\u00a0 But I have to do what I got elected on, and I have to do what I think is right.\nNow, if I got elected on something and I think I was wrong, I\u2019d second guess myself.\u00a0 I\u2019d change.\u00a0 But they want our soldiers back home.\u00a0 And I think we can do as well, or better, frankly.\u00a0 Let them \u2014 they\u2019ve got to \u2014 they\u2019ve got to keep going at each other.\u00a0 It\u2019s artificial to have these soldiers walking up and down between two big countries.\nAnd, by the way, I\u2019m just informed: Larry Kudlow is going to say a few remarks, if you want.\u00a0 Would you like to stay for Larry\u2019s remarks?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Because he is a great, great remark-maker.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Larry \u2014 after that whole thing, Larry, get up and go get it.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be great.\u00a0 Let them know how we\u2019re doing, Larry.\u00a0 If we\u2019re doing poorly, let them know.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\nMR. KUDLOW:\u00a0 Thanks, sir.\u00a0 I appreciate it very much.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a point I want to make right at the start.\u00a0 You\u2019ve put out some great numbers on some of the recent releases.\u00a0 You know, first and foremost, this is a middle class boom.\u00a0 I can\u2019t emphasize that enough.\u00a0 This is a middle class boom, even though perhaps some people won\u2019t give us credit for it.\nYou\u2019ve been rebuilding the economy, re-incentivizing the economy, lower taxes, lower regulations, opening up the energy sector, tough trade reforms for level playing fields.\u00a0 So after two and a half years, average real family income: $65,000.\u00a0 In fact, it\u2019s really closer to $66,000.\u00a0 So $6,000 gains.\u00a0 About 8 percent.\u00a0 It\u2019s better than anything our predecessors have done, be they Democrat or Republican.\u00a0 I\u2019m not being partisan here whatsoever.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Maybe ever, Larry.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 Maybe ever \u2014 in history.\nMR. KUDLOW:\u00a0 I\u2019d have to go \u2014 I\u2019d have to go back and \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Go check it.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been done.\nMR. KUDLOW:\u00a0 But it\u2019s a long ways, you\u2019re right.\u00a0 Sixty-five thousand \u2014 almost sixty-six thousand \u2014 that is the middle of middle.\u00a0 So, I think that\u2019s very important.\u00a0 And the increase of roughly 8 percent has never been done before.\nAnd, actually, if you look at the composition of wage increases, sir, the biggest gains have come in the middle quintile, the fourth, and the fifth.\u00a0 The lowest 10 percent have had the biggest increases \u2014 not the highest wages, mind you \u2014 but the biggest gains, which is what really matters to individual people.\u00a0 So I think that\u2019s absolutely a key point.\u00a0 The policies have spurred a middle-class boom.\nNow, 3.5 percent unemployment \u2014 the lowest in 51 years. 1.4 percent inflation.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a 50 percent increase, on balance, for the stock market.\u00a0 Household net worth \u2014 household net worth of $12 trillion dollars.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re about $103 trillion \u2014 $103 trillion dollars for American household net worth.\u00a0 Disposable income is now growing at 3 percent.\nThe reason these key points \u2014 inflation, stocks, income, wages \u2014 there\u2019s a model.\u00a0 There\u2019s a couple of these models.\u00a0 They\u2019re very interesting.\nI\u2019m going to talk about the Moody\u2019s model.\u00a0 It\u2019s been run by a friend of mine; he\u2019s an old friend of mine, Mark Zandi. Does not have much sympathetic views towards our administration \u2014 or me, for that matter.\u00a0 But, nonetheless \u2014 nonetheless, he\u2019s a good guy, personally.\u00a0 I don\u2019t take this stuff personally.\nBut their model is now showing, because of stocks, inflation, what he calls the \u201cpocketbook model\u201d \u2014 which is the average family income you talked about before \u2014 $66,000 \u2014 his electoral range is 289 to 351.\u00a0 289 to 351.\u00a0 I believe you need 270 to win.\u00a0 And the most important one is the \u201cpocketbook\u201d \u2014 the \u201cpocketbook model\u201d gives you 351 thousand.\u00a0 My former boss, Ronald Reagan, used to call it \u201ctake-home pay.\u201d\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing it once again.\u00a0 We\u2019re seeing it once again.\nIs this stuff going to happen?\u00a0 Well, their view is \u2014 and Oxford economics said the same thing \u2014 if we continue along this path, those are \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Are they predicting who is going to win the election, Larry?\u00a0 Is that what you\u2019re saying?\nMR. KUDLOW:\u00a0 Those are the kinds of numbers that suggest a very substantial victory.\u00a0 A very substantial victory.\u00a0 Let me go on again.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be brief on the wrap-up here.\nAmerica is working.\u00a0 As you said, 6 million jobs, 500,000-some-odd manufacturing job increases since you took office.\nLet me make this point.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been working hard on this, trying to convince my former colleagues in the media.\u00a0 September payrolls \u2014 we\u2019re still work- \u2014 September payrolls, including the revisions, up 181,000.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 7.1 million job openings.\u00a0 7.1 million job openings.\u00a0 5.8 million unemployed.\u00a0 We have more job openings than we have unemployed.\u00a0 This is the 18th straight month.\u00a0 That is a very rare economic stat.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Almost never happens.\nMR. KUDLOW:\u00a0 But let me go under the hood, just for a second.\u00a0 Besides the payroll numbers, there\u2019s another survey from which unemployment comes from.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 That 3.5 percent unemployment rate comes from something called the \u201chousehold survey,\u201d which tends to ask individual family members, small businesses, entrepreneurs, and starters.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 Household survey in the last four months is exploding.\u00a0 And it is averaging close to 400,000 per month.\u00a0 In other words, payrolls came in at 180, and the household survey is averaging close to 400,000.\nA lot of business and financial economists believe the household survey is your leading indicator.\u00a0 It tells me, sir, we could be in for another takeoff on the jobs story.\nWages \u2014 non-supervisory production wages up 3.5 percent.\nOne more leading indicator: the housing market \u2014 which has been soft for over a year, we\u2019re now seeing single family starts and sales, and pending sales have now shown several months of steady increases.\u00a0 That\u2019s a good leading indicator that the economy is going to be speeding up, not slowing down.\nAll of this in the face of a couple of years of very tight monetary policy and the fact that the rest of world is not growing \u2014 basically, Europe has been in recession.\u00a0 The rest of world has been in a virtual recession because of our incentive-minded policies.\u00a0 Because of our emphasis on trade and energy and deregulation, we are growing twice as fast as the rest of the world.\u00a0 And the numbers are telling me we may be ready for another pickup.\u00a0 We may be poised for another pickup after a quarter or two of softness.\nSo, I think we\u2019re in pretty good shape, sir.\u00a0 These are facts.\u00a0 My colleagues \u2014 or my former media colleagues may or may not agree, but I\u2019m happy to go through the facts, which is what I\u2019m really interested in here.\u00a0 And, of course, it\u2019s not breaking news that I\u2019m a low-tax rate, supply-sider from the Reagan-Laffer years.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut I do want to bring in my friend and colleague, Russ Vought of OMB, because part of this is the regulatory story \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 It\u2019s true.\nMR. KUDLOW:\u00a0 \u2014 the deregulatory story, which is helping jobs.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We\u2019ve cut regulations more than any administration in history, and that\u2019s in two and a half years.\u00a0 So, in two and a half years, we\u2019ve cut more regulation than any administration in the history of our country.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve been \u2014 for eight years and, in one case, for more than that.\u00a0 So that\u2019s been pretty good.\nThank you very much, Larry.\u00a0 That was very good.\nMR. KUDLOW:\u00a0 I\u2019m going to give it over to Russ.\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And Russ Vought \u2014\nMR. KUDLOW:\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\u00a0 Appreciate it.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Russ, if you could talk about regulation.\nACTING SECRETARY VOUGHT:\u00a0 Yeah, we\u2019re going like gangbusters, Mr. President, as a result of your commitment to the deregulatory initiative.\u00a0 Some numbers for our \u2014 the group here: nine to one.\u00a0 You set a commitment of two for \u2014 two deregulatory initiatives for every one.\u00a0 We\u2019re now at nine, at the close of our third year.\u00a0 That is $50 billion in cost savings, up from $33 billion.\u00a0 And that\u2019s just for those who are regulatory parties.\nSo if we \u2014 if you look at the economy-wide cost savings, it\u2019s $220 billion of savings for regulations \u2014 deregulatory initiatives in the pipeline.\u00a0 And that\u2019s in just the first round.\u00a0 Right now, we\u2019re going through a process to figure out what\u2019s next.\nWe want to be finishing the big deregulatory initiatives this year that you ran on.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to go forward this year with some exciting things to make sure infrastructure and permitting happens on a much quicker basis.\nThe Vice President is going to be leading a task force with governors to really multiply the efforts that they\u2019re doing on the state level \u2014 things like occupational licensing \u2014 to make sure that a hairdresser in Montana doesn\u2019t have to \u2014 when she moves, doesn\u2019t have to go through a thousand hours of training when she moves to Idaho.\u00a0 That\u2019s the kind of thing that we want to multiply between the states and the federal government to be able to really expand on the work that you\u2019ve been doing.\nSo we\u2019re excited about that.\u00a0 And we can\u2019t think of deregulatory initiatives without thinking about the work that Andrew Wheeler is doing at EPA.\u00a0 So I would love if you want to talk to \u2014 about your initiatives as well.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Okay, good.\u00a0 I think I\u2019ll maybe start with you, Andrew, if you could.\u00a0 Please.\nADMINISTRATOR WHEELER:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 I\u2019m here to update you on the implementation of your executive order regarding the Waters of the U.S.\u00a0 As you know, under the Clean Water Act, EPA regulates the discharge of pollutants into the nation\u2019s navigable waters \u2014 also known as \u201cWaters of the U.S.,\u201d or \u201cWOTUS.\u201d\nIn 2015, the Obama administration illegally expanded WOTUS to include things such as dry channels that only flows when it rains, isolated ponds, ditches.\u00a0 That\u2019s meant \u2014 that meant that the vast majority of the nation\u2019s waters would have fallen under the federal control.\u00a0 The Iowa Farm Bureau estimated that 97 percent of the state of Iowa would have fallen under federal control.\u00a0 A North Dakota agricultural commissioner estimated that over 90 percent of North Dakota would have been under federal control.\nThe Obama EPA claimed that the rule was in the interest of water quality, but it was really about power \u2014 power in the hands of the federal government.\u00a0 The rule upset the federal-state partnership, and expanding WOTUS would have meant more landowners would have had to obtain costly federal permits for activities on private property.\nThe permit process can cost anywhere from $30,000 to $300,000 for a water permit, and it takes one to two years or more.\u00a0 So the 2015 rule was mired in litigation.\u00a0 Thirty-one states opposed it.\nMr. President, you knew that the Obama WOTUS power grab was trouble from the get-go.\u00a0 And when you took office, you immediately asked us to fix the problem.\u00a0 EPA and the Department of Army are implementing your WOTUS executive order, and it\u2019s due \u2014 two-step process.\nLast month, Army Corps head R.D. James and I signed the final step-one rule repealing the 2015 rule.\u00a0 So the 2015 rule is no longer on the books.\u00a0 We\u2019ve reverted back to previous water definitions prior to 2015.\nWe are working on finalizing step two: our new proposed WOTUS definition that we\u2019ve proposed last December.\u00a0 The proposal will clearly define what is a federal wetland, as well as what is not, which is just as important.\u00a0 And it will limit where federal regulations apply.\nOur overreaching goal is that a property owner should be able to stand on his or her property and be able to tell for themselves whether or not they have a federal waterway without having to hire outside consultants to do that for them.\nWe received over 600,000 comments on our proposal and we intend to finalize our proposal this winter.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 And I know you\u2019re working on the small refineries \u2014 getting that straightened away so that it\u2019s going to be terrific for the small refineries.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been hurt for a long time, and we gave them waivers for this year.\u00a0 And that will \u2014 that\u2019s helped them a lot.\u00a0 But I want you to work on that.\u00a0 Make sure the small refineries are happy.\nAnd for the farmers, ethanol now has been fully approved.\u00a0 We spoke with Joni Ernst.\u00a0 We spoke with \u2014 and, very importantly \u2014 and we spoke with Chuck Grassley.\u00a0 And the ethanol \u2014 the whole situation with ethanol that has been going on for so long, for so many years \u2014 we have that now where it\u2019s finished, approved, done, and we\u2019re getting things ready to sign.\nPerhaps, Sonny, you could just talk about ethanol for our farmers for a couple of minutes, please.\nSECRETARY PERDUE:\u00a0 You\u2019ve done a couple of things, Mr. President.\u00a0 You\u2019ve \u2014 you, first of all, committed to and fulfilled your promise of making the E15 year-round.\u00a0 That\u2019s what\u2019s really needed to build infrastructure.\u00a0 That\u2019s a 50 percent increase in domestic usage there, which will happen.\u00a0 Good for the economy, good for the air, and good for the ag farmers in that way.\nYou\u2019ve also balanced up the smaller refinery waivers with the farmers and RFS.\u00a0 And once they fully understand what you\u2019ve done here, they\u2019ll be fine, and \u2014 as they see it implemented.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, they seem to be very happy.\u00a0 They deserve to be happy.\u00a0 They\u2019ve gone through a lot.\u00a0 They were targeted by China, as you know.\u00a0 And we took some of the money out of the tariffs \u2014 $16 billion and $12 billion for the two last years \u2014 and we gave it back to the farmer.\u00a0 They don\u2019t even want it; they just want a level playing field.\u00a0 But they were targeted unfairly by China.\nAnd now China is buying tremendous amounts of product \u2014 agricultural product.\u00a0 They\u2019ve started \u2014 maybe Bob Lighthizer could give us just a little update.\u00a0 I noticed that, today, China sent out a statement that the deal is coming along very well, that they expect to have a deal.\nDo you want to talk about China for a couple of seconds?\nAMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER:\u00a0 Yeah, sure, Mr. President.\u00a0 We had \u2014 we had had deputy-level meetings this morning.\u00a0 Secretary Mnuchin and I were going to be talking to our counterparts on Friday, and we think we\u2019re making great progress.\u00a0 Our \u2014 as you say, our target is to have a phase-one deal done by the time you go to Chile.\u00a0 And while there are still some issues we have to resolve, we\u2019re working towards that goal.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, one little example is the farmers.\u00a0 So they were told and I was told, if we could get $20 billion a year in purchase \u2014 the biggest they\u2019ve ever done is $16 [billion], is what I\u2019ve heard and what they\u2019ve said.\u00a0 If we could get $20 billion a year from China \u2014 that China purchases $20 billion a year of agricultural product \u2014 that would be a great thing.\u00a0 So my people had $20 billion done.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cI want more.\u201d\u00a0 They said, \u201cThe farmers can\u2019t handle it.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cTell them to buy larger tractors.\u00a0 It\u2019s very simple.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019ll buy more land and they\u2019ll buy larger tractors.\u00a0 But I want more.\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cWe want $60 billion to $70 billion.\u201d\u00a0 And we agreed to $40 [billion] to $50 billion.\u00a0 So they wanted $20 billion, and I got $40 [billion] to $50 billion.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve already started buying.\u00a0 And that\u2019s just the way it goes.\u00a0 So I want to thank China for that.\nAnd they have started the buying.\u00a0 So while we\u2019re papering the deal \u2014 and that\u2019s going well \u2014 we hope to sign it probably in Chile, when we have a summit in Chile, or wherever that may be.\nBut we\u2019ll be able to, we think, sign a completed document with China on phase one.\u00a0 Then we start working on phase two.\u00a0 And actually, things in phase two are easier than phase one, but it\u2019s so big.\u00a0 Like, as an example, on the agricultural products, it\u2019s so big that we thought doing phases would be good.\u00a0 But actually, the things in the second phase are, in many ways, a lot easier than the things in the first phase.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll see how that goes.\nSECRETARY PERDUE:\u00a0 Mr. President, I\u2019m not sure who told you the farmers couldn\u2019t handle it, but it wasn\u2019t me.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think they could.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I want the farmers to come tell me, \u201cSir, we can\u2019t produce that much.\u201d\u00a0 The farmers don\u2019t know that language, right?\nSECRETARY PERDUE:\u00a0 Right.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 But we took it from $20 [billion] to potentially $50 billion.\u00a0 It will be bought \u2014 more \u2014 more agriculture will be bought \u2014 product \u2014 will be bought than any time in our history, by far.\u00a0 That\u2019s on top of the Japan deal that we just made, where Japan is buying a tremendous amount of ag and other things from our country and our farmers.\nOur farmers have been great.\u00a0 They never wavered.\u00a0 They said, \u201cThe President is doing the right thing.\u00a0 We\u2019re sticking with the President.\u201d\nI tell you, I didn\u2019t see anybody \u2014 they looked \u2014 some of the networks, they looked.\u00a0 They looked all over for somebody that can speak negatively about the President.\u00a0 And those farmers, Sonny, they stopped.\u00a0 They said, \u201cNope, he\u2019s doing the right thing.\u00a0 It may be hurting us, but he\u2019s doing the right thing.\u201d\u00a0 And I think, in many ways, the farmer maybe is going to be the biggest beneficiary of what we\u2019re doing \u2014 certainly one of them.\u00a0 I think our country is going to be the biggest beneficiary.\nSecretary, could I ask you to talk a little bit about drug pricing?\u00a0 Because we\u2019ve cut it down a lot.\nSECRETARY AZAR:\u00a0 Mm-hmm.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And we had the first year ever where prices actually went down.\u00a0 And if we had Democrat support, we could get them way down, but we don\u2019t have a lot of Democrat support.\u00a0 If you could talk about it, please.\nSECRETARY AZAR:\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 So we\u2019ve had the third year in a row under President Trump\u2019s leadership, of historic levels of approving generic drugs.\u00a0 Those are the affordable alternatives to brand drugs.\u00a0 We\u2019re approaching 3,000 generic drugs approved under your tenure.\u00a0 That led to \u2014 just in the first 18 months of your term \u2014 $26 billion of savings for people from those more affordable alternatives.\nAnd as a result, we have seen now, for the first time in 51 years, the largest decrease in prescription drug pricing under the Labor Department\u2019s inflation index \u2014 the largest decrease in 51 years.\nWe\u2019re working with Congress, of course, trying to craft a bipartisan package there.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re in agreement on about 80 percent of the items.\u00a0 We\u2019re probably the most flexible party in the negotiations between the Democrats and the Republicans, and try to deliver real savings for the American people.\nBut we\u2019re not stopping.\u00a0 We\u2019re continuing to work on your scheme to bring drugs in from Canada \u2014 to import drugs \u2014 and how we can make sure we\u2019re getting the same kind of deals for the American senior that other developed countries are getting.\u00a0 As you called it, \u201cmost favored nation status.\u201d\u00a0 So we\u2019re driving ahead.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So I\u2019ve read for years that other countries have much lower drug prices than we do.\u00a0 So I said to a couple of our governors \u2014 including Ron DeSantis of Florida, who\u2019s very much into it: \u201cGo to Canada, where the prices are 50 percent.\u00a0 Buy it from Canada.\u00a0 We\u2019ll give you the approval.\u201d\u00a0 And we\u2019re working on those final approvals now.\nSo Canada buys \u2014 because of arcane rules and because of protecting the middleman and protecting drug companies, frankly, other countries have prices that are much, much lower.\u00a0 You know, more than 50 percent, in some cases.\u00a0 Canada\u2019s pricing is much lower.\nSo I told Ron DeSantis, I told other governors, \u201cGo to Canada.\u00a0 Go to other countries.\u00a0 Buy them.\u201d\u00a0 Same product.\u00a0 Same exact manufacturer.\u00a0 Many times, they\u2019re manufactured in the same plant, and a pill will cost you 50 percent or less than it does in the United States.\u00a0 That just shows you how bad people have run our country.\nAnd we\u2019re going to get tremendous price cuts on drugs.\u00a0 And we\u2019re in the process.\u00a0 And I\u2019d like you to speed that up, Alex, if you could.\u00a0 Really speed it up.\nSECRETARY AZAR:\u00a0 Okay.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Because Canada is loving to sell it.\u00a0 I mean, we\u2019re buying the exact same product for 50 percent.\u00a0 That means people are going to get a 50 percent reduction in drug prices.\u00a0 So \u2014 and in some cases, substantially more.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to believe how this country was taken advantage of by, frankly, everybody in every different way.\u00a0 Okay?\nSo, thank you.\u00a0 And I\u2019d like to ask Gene Scalia to maybe speak.\u00a0 Gene is a highly respected gentleman and one of the best lawyers in the country.\u00a0 Focused on labor law.\u00a0 And he\u2019s now a Department of Labor Secretary.\u00a0 And it\u2019s great to have you at our first meeting.\u00a0 And thank you.\u00a0 Your first meeting.\u00a0 I\u2019m very proud of you.\u00a0 You got through.\u00a0 He got a \u2014 he passed with a massive majority of a votes.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 What was the number?\nSECRETARY SCALIA:\u00a0 53-44.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s considered a massive, massive \u2014 that\u2019s probably the largest number, if you can believe it.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY SCALIA:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great honor to join you, the Vice President, and the Cabinet in the important work you\u2019re doing for the American people, including on the economic front.\u00a0 You and Larry Kudlow mentioned some of those numbers, which really are virtually unprecedented.\u00a0 As you said, in some cases, unprecedented unemployment numbers \u2014 since we\u2019ve been tracking \u2014 for African Americans or Hispanic Americans; the lowest unemployment rate for women in generations.\nAnd as Larry said, for those at the lower end of the economic scale, they particularly are enjoying these benefits.\u00a0 Americans who don\u2019t have a high school degree have the lowest employment rate we\u2019ve ever seen.\u00a0 And this has been, in part, because of your efforts to bring about deregulation to free employers to grow, offer more jobs.\nI wanted to mention two that we\u2019re doing at the Labor Department, and they\u2019re both as a result of executive orders that you issued, Mr. President.\nThe first has to do with what we call association health plans.\u00a0 And this is for small employers who employ tens of millions of American workers.\u00a0 They\u2019re critical to our economy, but they find it hard to provide reasonably priced healthcare to their workers.\nSo what we did was we reduced some regulatory hurdles that stood in the way of small employers coming together, forming an association, working with the local chamber of commerce, for example, to provide healthcare through that association.\u00a0 That association can give the economies of scale of a larger company.\u00a0 It has leverage of a larger company.\u00a0 It has other ways that it can tailor the benefits available to these employees at the small \u2014 at the small employers.\nThe CBO has estimated that about 4 million Americans would benefit from these programs and that they\u2019ll have premium reductions of as much as $2,000 as a result of these plans.\nI should say, some disgruntled state attorneys general \u2014 this has happened before, Mr. President \u2014 they\u2019ve sued over one of your regulatory initiatives.\u00a0 But I\u2019m also pleased to say that my favorite Attorney General \u2014 yours; my former boss \u2014 Bill Barr, his lawyers at the Justice Department are defending this litigation right now.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And we should win.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSECRETARY SCALIA:\u00a0 And we\u2019ve got a related plan, what we call association retirement plans.\u00a0 And this, again, was a result of an executive order you issued, Mr. President.\u00a0 Same concept: Let smaller employers come together, achieve economies of scale, exercise leverage in negotiating to offer 401(k) plans.\nThere are about 40 million Americans who don\u2019t have a retirement plan, who don\u2019t have a 401(k) plan.\u00a0 This will make it easier for them to get those plans.\nSo, Mr. President, those are two examples of steps that are helping the economy, they\u2019re deregulating, but as I\u2019ve described, they\u2019re helping workers get healthcare, get retirement coverage.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s a big thing on the 401(k), Gene, too.\u00a0 That\u2019s very important.\u00a0 Thank you.\nKellyanne, you were going to say about buy-back?\nMS. CONWAY:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr. President.\u00a0 Because of the focus that you and the First Lady and the entire Cabinet and this administration have placed on combatting the drug supply/drug demand crisis in our nation, we are happy to report the first decline in 30 years of overdose deaths due to drugs \u2014 a decline of 5.1 percent overall \u2014 falling off of its peak in some of our states, up to 24 percent.\u00a0 A 24 percent reduction in overdose deaths in Ohio and 23 percent in Pennsylvania.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got about 19 percent in Iowa, 17 percent in Kentucky, 11 percent in New Hampshire, and 9 percent in the hardest-hit state of West Virginia.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Those are really incredible numbers, folks.\u00a0 I mean, you\u2019re not going to report them, so we\u2019re just wasting our time.\nMS. CONWAY:\u00a0 Perhaps they will.\u00a0 But it may \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Those \u2014 those are great numbers.\nMS. CONWAY:\u00a0 But this battleship is turning in the right direction, albeit slowly.\nBut, Mr. President, the most significant bipartisan accomplishment, in my view, of your presidency was HR.6.\u00a0 We\u2019re on the year anniversary of HR.6.\u00a0 Every single Democrat voted for HR.6, including the ones running for President.\u00a0 It is the largest investment of billions of dollars in prevention education, treatment, and recovery, and surveillance, and interdiction in our nation\u2019s history on any one drug crisis.\nPart of the education and equipping America is called \u201cTake Back Day.\u201d\u00a0 The Drug Enforcement Agency, the DEA, runs two Take Back Days each year.\u00a0 The next one is this Saturday.\nSince the Trump administration got into office, we\u2019ve collected 4.6 million pounds of unused prescription drugs.\u00a0 Let me repeat that: It\u2019s not four \u2014 just 4.6 million drugs; that would be something.\u00a0 4.6 million pounds.\u00a0 That\u2019s the weight of 18 Boeing 757 aircrafts just collected.\u00a0 So it is a drug supply and a drug demand crisis.\nWe have partnered with over 5,000 law enforcement agencies.\u00a0 And due to private sector partnerships with CVS, Rite Aid, Google, Walgreens, Walmart, and the rest, we have 8,300 total sites nationwide now that Google will map out for us.\u00a0 So if you just type into the computer, \u201cTake back my drugs,\u201d \u201creturn prescription opioids,\u201d they will show you locations in your area and tell you how to drive or walk there.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a safe way of returning your drugs.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s a more convenient and more compassionate way for people to return unused, unneeded, expired pills.\u00a0 That happens on Saturday.\nThe Cabinet has been so consistently and so deeply involved.\u00a0 And I want to thank each and every one of them for this effort, and Mr. President, as well as the First Lady and you.\nAlso, I\u2019m happy to report that CVS has fulfilled its commitment to double the number of Take Back sites.\u00a0 And in our effort to make every day Take Back Day, people don\u2019t need to wait any longer for every six months.\u00a0 Walgreens, CVS, they\u2019ve got sort of safe delay \u2014 safe site, safe safes, where you\u2019re delaying the distribution of pharmaceuticals to make sure it\u2019s going to the person it\u2019s intended to go.\nI\u2019m happy to report the NFL, two weeks ago, sent out a message to all of its NFL clubs, equipping them to show our Trump administration public service announcements on Opioid Take Back Day, along with graphics.\u00a0 And the NFL Network is involved.\nAnd finally, Major League Baseball, last week, agreed to show DEA\u2019s Take Back Day public service announcement this Friday during the World Series.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Kellyanne.\u00a0 Take Back Day is a big deal.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve been talking about it for a long time.\u00a0 Nobody has ever done it.\u00a0 But it is big.\nAnd Alex wanted to mention just one additional thing.\u00a0 Go ahead.\nSECRETARY AZAR:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Just on the deregulation agenda, deregulation is a \u2014 it\u2019s a key part of that great healthcare that you promised the American people, this vision of a personalized, affordable patient-centric system that puts you, the patient, in the center and in control, and treats you like a human being, not like a number.\u00a0 Because if you\u2019re focusing on the bureaucracy, that\u2019s not focusing on the patient.\nSo we\u2019ve delivered $12.5 billion of regulatory savings.\u00a0 That\u2019s over half of the entire government.\u00a0 I\u2019ll give you an example.\u00a0 We have freed up 40 million hours of doctor and nurse time to not be doing paperwork.\u00a0 Forty million hours have been freed up that they can spend with patients instead.\u00a0 But there\u2019s been incredible change, and we\u2019re going to able to just keep delivering that level of deregulation each year.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And something that some people think could be as big or bigger than healthcare is transparency.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing transparency.\u00a0 And did you want to give just a one-minute update on that transparency in pricing and transparency on the quality of your doctor?\nSECRETARY AZAR:\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 So, this is something \u2014 the President has often said that transparency \u2014 his initiatives on transparency could be bigger than any kind of healthcare \u2014 individual healthcare plan that you might have.\u00a0 What he means by that is, what we have proposed is making all of a hospital\u2019s rates \u2014 what they have negotiated with the individual insurer \u2014 transparent and available so that you, the patient, would know, before you go to the hospital, what something is going to cost you on your actual insurance plan.\nAnd then we\u2019ll do that with insurance regulations so that your insurance company will send you, before you go to the doctor\u2019s office, an advanced Explanation of Benefits that tells you the list price, the negotiated price, and what you\u2019ll pay out of pocket.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to make this information available to you, as individuals.\u00a0 This is going to empower you.\u00a0 This will shake up the entire healthcare system to put the patient at the center so that you have the right to create a real consumer experience in healthcare, unlike what we\u2019ve had for the last 50 years.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And just to end, as our \u2014 as our trade deals start kicking in \u2014 these trade deals are incredible.\u00a0 Whether it\u2019s North Korea, South Korea \u2014 North Korea is going to be \u2014 probably, something is going to be happening with North Korea too.\u00a0 There\u2019s some very interesting information on North Korea.\u00a0 A lot of things are going on.\u00a0 And that\u2019s going to be a major rebuild at a certain point.\nAnd South Korea is getting much more involved with us than we ever thought in terms of the economy and in terms of the trade deal.\u00a0 A lot of money is being spent over there, and they\u2019re going to be doing it through us.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been doing tremendous purchases.\u00a0 We had a tremendous deficit with them.\u00a0 And we\u2019re slowly eating away at these deficits.\u00a0 We had deficits with everybody.\nBut as the trade deals start kicking in with China, especially phase one with the farmers and with the banks \u2014 the banking system, financial services \u2014 as they start kicking in, you\u2019re going to see a tremendous difference in the economy.\u00a0 The economy is already, by far, number one.\nSo, if I weren\u2019t elected, by right now, China would be the largest economy in the world.\u00a0 It was expected.\u00a0 It was said by many people that China would, right now \u2014 they were expecting around the second year of this term.\u00a0 Not only aren\u2019t they the biggest economy in the world, but they are way, way, way far away.\u00a0 We are much bigger than the China economy.\u00a0 And we\u2019re getting bigger, and they\u2019re not.\nNow, they have 1.4 billion people.\u00a0 I guess you\u2019d call that an advantage.\u00a0 But we have an economy like no other.\u00a0 I think we have the strongest economy we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 And I think if you add the economy, the military, and all the other things that we\u2019ve done, there\u2019s nothing like it.\u00a0 But when trade deals start kicking in \u2014 and, as I said, the South Korea deal did kick in, and things are happening with that that are very positive.\u00a0 But as they kick in, you\u2019re going to see tremendous numbers, tremendous changes.\u00a0 Because the trade deals we had were so pathetic.\u00a0 They were so bad.\u00a0 I used to sit back and say to Lighthizer, \u201cHow did somebody actually negotiate these deals?\u00a0 How did they even negotiate them?\u201d\nThis was done at a level that \u2014 it\u2019s not even understandable why people were allowed to do it, how they were allowed, how they got passed.\u00a0 But we\u2019re making great deals.\u00a0 And when they kick in, the economy, as good as it\u2019s been doing \u2014 and I think, Larry, I can say, that as good as it\u2019s been doing, it\u2019s going to be even better than that.\nSo, our country is doing fantastically well, perhaps better than ever before.\u00a0 Thank you all very much.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nEND\n12:54 P.M.

        "text": "Walter E. Washington Convention Center\nWashington, D.C.\n10:41 A.M. EDT\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: \u00a0Well, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Administrator Jim Bridenstine.\u00a0 Thank you for those kind words.\u00a0 But more importantly, would you all join me in thanking the great administrator of NASA for the work he is doing to revive American leadership in space?\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd to all the extraordinary leaders and innovators gathered here from all across America and all around the world \u2014 men and women who are share \u2014 who share our vision for human exploration, for American and worldwide innovation, carrying us back to the vast expanse of space: It is my great honor to welcome all of you to this incredible gathering, celebrating the power of the past and the promise of the future, the Opening Ceremony of the 70th International Astronautical Congress.\u00a0 Welcome to Washington, D.C.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd as I begin, allow me to bring greetings from a man who is committed to renewing American leadership here on Earth and in the boundless expanse of space and who has brought a renewed vigor and vision to America\u2019s space enterprise.\u00a0 I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYou know, the United States has always been a nation of restless pioneers, ever striving to explore uncharted lands, reach new horizons, and venture into the unknown, including efforts to expand the boundaries of human knowledge.\nAnd earlier this year, the world paid tribute to three great Americans and to the 400,000 men and women who made their journey possible 50 years ago this year, when those three Americans and all who support them undertook \u201cthe most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure upon which mankind [had] ever embarked.\u201d\u00a0 They turned \u201cone small step for man\u201d into \u201cone giant leap for mankind.\u201d\u00a0 And today, you\u2019ll help celebrate that.\nSo would you join me in congratulating the 2019 World Space Award winners, the crew of Apollo 11?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Including the incomparable Buzz Aldrin, who is with us here today \u2014 (applause) \u2014 the grandson of Michael Collins, and the son of Commander Neil Armstrong, Mark Armstrong.\u00a0 Let\u2019s hear it, everybody.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIt\u2019s an honor to be with all of you and to remember the extraordinary contributions that you, Buzz, and your family members made to mankind 50 years ago.\nAnd as I stand before you today, as we remember the past, I\u2019m proud to report that the United States of America is renewing the legacy of those courageous space pioneers and all they represent.\u00a0 Because under President Donald Trump\u2019s leadership, America is leading in space once again.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn our first year in office, after it had lain dormant for nearly a quarter of a century, President Trump revived the National Space Council to coordinate space activities across the whole of government.\u00a0 And it is, as Jim Bridenstine said, my great honor to serve as chairman of the National Space Council, as other Vice Presidents have done before me.\nAt President Trump\u2019s direction, we\u2019ve renewed America\u2019s commitment to human space exploration, vowing to go further into space than ever before.\nIn our first year in office, the President signed what came to be known as Space Policy Directive-1, making the national policy of the United States of America to return to the Moon and prioritize crewed missions to the lunar surface.\nAnd earlier this year, President Trump made it the policy of this administration to return to the Moon by 2024, ensuring that the next man and the first woman on the Moon will both be American astronauts.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn fact, as you just heard, NASA made history this past week when it successfully performed the first unmanned spacewalk \u2014 the first all-woman spacewalk as [in] history.\u00a0 So join me in congratulating American astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch for their historic accomplishments, past, present, and future.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAs President Trump has said, we will return American astronauts to the Moon \u201cfor the first time since 1972 for long-term exploration and use.\u201d\u00a0 And not only to \u201cplant our flag and leave our footprint,\u201d but to \u201cestablish a foundation for an eventual mission to Mars.\u201d\nWith Apollo in the history books, the Artemis mission has begun, and we are well on our way to making NASA\u2019s Moon-to-Mars Mission a reality.\nIn order for us to take this next big leap, we\u2019ll develop the technologies to live on the Moon for months and even years.\u00a0 We\u2019ll learn how to make use of resources that the Moon has to offer.\u00a0 That includes mining oxygen from the lunar surface and rocks to fuel reusable landers, extracting water from the permanently shadowed craters of the south pole, and developing a new generation of nuclear-powered spacecraft that will help us fly further and farther and faster than ever before.\nSo we\u2019re going back to the Moon and then to Mars.\u00a0 And we\u2019re taking steps to ensure that the American space industry is up to the task as well.\u00a0 Working with partners from our Users\u2019 Advisory Group, we promulgated a long range of reforms to invigorate the commercial space sector across this country and across the world.\u00a0 In fact, I know that many members of the Users\u2019 Advisory Group \u2014 leaders in industry that are giving counsel to our nation\u2019s space efforts \u2014 are with us today.\u00a0 Would the members of the Users\u2019 Advisory Group please stand and allow all of these colleagues to show their appreciation to each and every one of you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you all.\nI want thank Admiral Jim Ellis and all the distinguished members of the National Space Council\u2019s Users\u2019 Advisory Group.\u00a0 And working with each and one of them, and in close cooperation with our allies around the world, including many of the nations represented here, we\u2019ve encouraged a more stable space environment by developing the word\u2019s first comprehensive Space Traffic Management Policy.\u00a0 And the guidance of our Users\u2019 Advisory Group assisted with that.\nOur administration is committed to ensuring that the United States also leverages the power of private enterprise in space.\u00a0 And even now, NASA is leading a commercial-friendly effort to develop the orbital platforms that will one day replace the International Space Station, as well as the human lunar landers that will carry us back to the Moon.\nToday, thanks to the leadership that President Trump has provided, the United States of America is open for business to all space enterprises.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAs we\u2019ve built up confidence in the opportunities that space can provide, we\u2019ve unleashed the American space industry as never before.\u00a0 Evidence of that: In August, SpaceX carried more than 3,300 pounds of samples and cargo down to Earth at the conclusion of its 18th commercial resupply mission for the International Space Station.\u00a0 Two weeks ago, Northrop Grumman made history when it launched the first-ever commercial satellite-servicing spacecraft to not only extend the lifespan of several satellites, but also pave the way for in-space manufacturing.\nAnd just last week, LeoLabs announced the operation of its advanced Kiwi Space Radar, which has the capability to track debris in space as small as two centimeters and will help protect billions of dollars in spacecraft and satellites from colliding with dangerous objects in orbit.\nAnd space companies have driven incredible economic growth across the globe. I know that\u2019s well understood in this room and by all that are looking on.\u00a0 In the first half of this year, we\u2019ve seen almost as much invested in space companies as we did in the entire year before.\u00a0 In fact, in the last decade, nearly $25 billion has been invested in nearly 500 different space companies, and I\u2019m proud to say that the majority of those investments have been directed to American businesses.\nOur continued success in space will require a close cooperation of all of us across governments, universities, and the commercial space industry, which is what makes this 70th International Astronautical Congress so important.\nThe good news is that, with the renewed American leadership in space, we\u2019re also seeing renewed cooperation among freedom-loving nations around the world to advance space exploration.\u00a0 Already, as I stand here today, 18 of the nations represented here have proven their ability to work together through the 19-year mission of the International Space Station.\nAnd just last month, Australia announced a historic $150 million investment in the burgeoning space industry in their country, including through support of NASA\u2019s Artemis lunar program and our future mission to Mars.\nCanada has already agreed to support development of the Lunar Gateway \u2014 a critical outpost and refueling station that\u2019ll help us develop technologies, test the systems, and train the astronauts for the first-ever crewed mission to Mars.\nAnd just last week, Prime Minister Abe announced Japan\u2019s intention to join our efforts, both in the Lunar Gateway and on the lunar surface.\u00a0 Japan has been a vital partner of the International Space Station, in our mutual defense and in countless other endeavors.\u00a0 And so we are grateful for this most recent sign of Japan\u2019s enduring commitment to a partnership and for their support of our Moon-to-Mars Mission.\nAnd as I stand before you today, even now I know that our friends and allies in Europe are holding active discussions about involvement in our space exploration missions.\u00a0 So on behalf of the United States of America, let me say to all of our allies and partners in space: Thank you for working with us to advance human understanding in space.\u00a0 We will do it together.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYou know, when President Trump revived the National Space Council, he said that he believed, as I do, that, \u201cIt is America\u2019s destiny\u2026to be the leader amongst nations on our adventure into the great unknown.\u201d\u00a0 And American history has proven that out.\u00a0 But to be clear, our vision is to be the leader amongst freedom-loving nations on the adventure into the great unknown.\nAnd here at this International Astronautical Congress, let me say: The United States of America will always be willing to work closely with like-minded, freedom-loving nations, as we lead mankind into the final frontier.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAs more nations gain the ability to explore space and develop places beyond Earth\u2019s atmosphere, we must also ensure \u2014 we must also ensure that we carry into space our shared commitment for freedom and the rule of law and private property.\nThe long-term exploration and development of the Moon, Mars, and other celestial bodies will require the use of resources found in outer space, including water and minerals.\u00a0 And so we must encourage the responsible commercial use of these resources, which is why the United States will continue to honor international law and existing space agreements that protect private property, while pursuing new policies that build trust with our allies, our commercial partners, and other spacefaring nations.\nWe will use all available legal and diplomatic means to create a stable and orderly space environment that drives opportunity, creates prosperity, and ensures our security on Earth and in the vast expanse of space.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSpace plays a critical role in our national security as it does for every nation around the world.\u00a0 And, to that end, President Trump has directed our administration to work with bipartisan leadership in Congress.\u00a0 And soon, we will stand up the sixth branch of our Armed Forces: the United States Space Force.\u00a0 Soon, it will be a reality and the Space Force will be a vanguard to defending our nation, defending our freedom, and defending the rights of all freedom-loving nations in the vast expanses of space.\nSo it\u2019s an honor to be with all of you today, to be able to update you briefly on the progress that we\u2019re making.\u00a0 And I know this is going to be a momentous week as you gather here at this important international conference.\u00a0 I hope you will leave America\u2019s capital with confidence that America is leading in space again, and that we are determined to lead \u2014 be the leader amongst freedom-loving nations into the vast expanse of space.\nWe\u2019re opening the doors for private space enterprise to develop the means and technology for low-Earth orbit.\u00a0 And with the President\u2019s vision for NASA\u2019s renewed Moon-to-Mars Mission, I truly believe that, working with so many of the nations gathered here, we will once again inspire the world by the heights we reach and the history we make.\nSo thank you for the opportunity of addressing each one of you today.\u00a0 You know, it is said \u2014 it is said, without a vision, that people perish.\u00a0 And I would offer today that so, too, do great endeavors.\nThe truth is, for more than a generation, a vision for human space exploration had languished in this country and around the world.\u00a0 But those days are over.\u00a0 With America\u2019s renewed vision for human space exploration, we will lead mankind into the vast expanse of space.\nThe task before us will involve hardship and hazard, sacrifice and determination.\u00a0 And it will require faith.\u00a0 Faith in the boundless capacity of American ingenuity and the ingenuity and cooperation of freedom-loving nations around the world.\u00a0 Faith in the extraordinary courage of the men and women who, even now, train and prepare to move the boundary lines of human knowledge.\u00a0 And faith, as generations of Americans have long believed, that even if we rise on the wings of the dawn, even if we go up to the heavens, even there, His hand will guide us and His right hand will hold us fast.\nSo thank you for the opportunity of addressing you today and helping you begin what I know will be an important week in the space enterprise in our nation around the world.\nAnd I\u2019m confident that with the leadership of President Donald Trump, with the courage of a new generation of explorers, with the strong support and cooperation of our private partners, and with the strong cooperation of all of our freedom-loving international allies, and with God\u2019s help, we will lead the world into the vast expanse of space once again for the benefit of all mankind.\nThank you.\u00a0 God bless you.\u00a0 God bless the nations represented here.\u00a0 And God bless America.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEND\n10:59 A.M. EDT\n"

KOCH:\u00a0 We can hear you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s great.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMS. TRUMP:\u00a0 Yes!\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s great.\u00a0 I was starting to get worried about you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I was starting to get worried about you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 You\u2019re in an interesting place.\nI thought we may have to be \u2014 a little emergency work.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think that will ever be necessary with you.\u00a0 The job that you do is incredible.\nAnd I\u2019m here with Vice President Mike Pence, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, and my daughter, Ivanka.\u00a0 We\u2019re thrilled to be speaking live with two brave American astronauts who are making history.\nJoining us during their spacewalk outside the International Space Station \u2014 and this is the first time for a woman outside of the Space Station \u2014 are Flight Engineers Christina Koch and Flight Engineer Jessica Meir.\nAnd I just want to congratulate you.\u00a0 What you do is incredible.\u00a0 It\u2019s so \u2014 you\u2019re very brave people.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think I want to do it, I must tell you that.\u00a0 But you are amazing people.\nThey\u2019re conducting the first-ever female spacewalk to replace an exterior part of the Space Station.\u00a0 They\u2019re doing some work, and they\u2019re doing it in a very high altitude \u2014 an altitude that very few people will ever see.\nCongratulations, Christina and Jessica, on this historic event.\u00a0 This is truly historic.\u00a0 And you\u2019re right now on television all over the world, so don\u2019t get nervous.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nI\u2019d like to ask you a question: What would you like to tell everyone listening and watching today, especially young women \u2014\nDR. MEIR:\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 who are interested in space?\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:\u00a0 There\u2019s about a four- or five-second delay.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Ah, okay.\nDR. MEIR:\u00a0 Hello.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 First \u2014 first of all, we don\u2019t want to take too much credit, because there have been many other female spacewalkers before us.\u00a0 This is just the first time that there have been two women outside at the same time.\nAnd it\u2019s really interesting for us.\u00a0 We\u2019ve talked a lot about it up here.\u00a0 You know, for us, this is really just us doing our job.\u00a0 It\u2019s something we\u2019ve been training for, for six years, and preparing for.\u00a0 And so, it didn\u2019t really, you know \u2014 for us, it\u2019s just coming out here and doing our job today.\u00a0 And we were the \u2014 we were the crew that was tasked with this assignment.\nAt the same time, we recognize that it is a historic achievement, and we do, of course, want to give credit to all of those that came before us.\u00a0 There has been a long line of female scientists, explorers, engineers, and astronauts, and we have followed in their footsteps to get us where we are today.\nWe hope that we can provide an inspiration to everybody, not only (inaudible), but to everybody that has a dream and has a big dream and that is willing to work hard to make that dream come true \u2014 something that all of us that have made our way up here have done all throughout our lives.\u00a0 And I can tell you, the hard work certainly did pay off.\nI\u2019ve only been up here a few weeks, actually \u2014 about three weeks I\u2019ve been in space \u2014 and this is my first flight and my very first spacewalk.\u00a0 So it is a pretty incredible feeling.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure you can all imagine.\u00a0 And it\u2019s one that I will never forget.\nI\u2019m extremely fortunate to be sharing this moment with Christina Koch, who\u2019s not only my colleague, but also a very, very close and dear friend.\nSo it\u2019s really our honor to be out here working today and to be representing whatever it is that\u2019s significant to whatever \u2014 whatever individuals\u2019 desires and hearts.\nThank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, Christina and Jessica, I would like to, if I could, just thank you.\u00a0 Jessica, I know that you\u2019ve been doing this and you\u2019ve been working hard.\u00a0 And, Christina, I\u2019ve studied your r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u00a0 It\u2019s really incredible what you\u2019ve done, what you\u2019ve both done.\u00a0 Your lives have been incredible.\u00a0 And now you\u2019re in a place that, as I said, very few people will ever get that experience.\u00a0 You\u2019re doing an incredible job.\nThis is a first step \u2014 because we\u2019re going to the Moon, and then we\u2019re going to Mars.\u00a0 We\u2019re launching from the Moon most likely.\u00a0 They seem to think that\u2019s the best way of doing it, Jim.\u00a0 So we\u2019re launching from the Moon.\nAnd I just want to congratulate you both.\u00a0 You\u2019re very brave, brilliant women, and you represent this country so well.\u00a0 And our country is very proud of you, and we are very proud of you.\u00a0 Millions and millions of people are watching you right now.\u00a0 But I will tell you: What you do is really something very special.\nSo, first the Moon, and then we go to Mars.\u00a0 Thank you both very much.\u00a0 Have a good time.\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering if we might have lost the link at this time.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 Maybe they didn\u2019t like my message.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Could be.\nAnyway, two great women.\u00a0 Two great people.\u00a0 And, you know, it\u2019s a big danger.\u00a0 Not easy.\u00a0 It\u2019s not an easy thing to do.\u00a0 A lot of people would take a pass on that one.\u00a0 But they\u2019re great women.\nOPERATOR:\u00a0 Back to the scoop.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think I heard that.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 There\u2019s the link.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s the link.\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:\u00a0 Oh, that\u2019s the link.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s the end of the link.\u00a0 So they heard my message and they tried to respond and \u2014 (laughter) \u2014\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:\u00a0 It\u2019s space.\nMS. TRUMP:\u00a0 Not the easiest of phone calls.\u00a0 (Laughs.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I assume they\u2019re okay.\u00a0 I assume they\u2019re okay.\u00a0 Anyway, they\u2019re actually outside of the ship.\u00a0 So that\u2019s something.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 That\u2019s the first time it\u2019s \u2014\nMS. TRUMP:\u00a0 The first time since 1969 that a President has spoken to astronauts outside of the spaceship.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s incredible.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That was a great \u2014 that was a great \u2014 it\u2019s a great thing.\u00a0 And when are they coming back?\u00a0 What\u2019s the timing?\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:\u00a0 So each one is different.\u00a0 Christina Koch is actually going to be \u2014 have the longest single endurance mission.\u00a0 So she\u2019s going to be on the Space Station for, I think, it\u2019s a little \u2014 about 10 months, which the longest \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Wow.\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:\u00a0 \u2014 we\u2019ve ever had a woman on the Space Station ever.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 What\u2019s the longest for a man?\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:\u00a0 Three hundred and forty five days.\u00a0 So \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So why don\u2019t you have the woman break the record?\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:\u00a0 Well, we have a very tight schedule when it comes to windows to get back and forth to the International Space Station.\u00a0 But that\u2019s within the realm of what is possible.\u00a0 We\u2019re working on schedules, sir.\nMS. TRUMP:\u00a0 And next, a woman on the Moon, right?\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0 The \u2014 by direction of the President, we will have the first man \u2014 or, I should say, the first woman and next man on the south pole of the Moon will be Americans.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And what\u2019s your timing on that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we better not say it too fast.\u00a0 Get it done before you talk about it.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Go ahead.\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:\u00a0 The goal is 2024, sir.\u00a0 We\u2019re at \u2014 if all things go according to plan, 2024 is within the realm of what is possible.\u00a0 And we\u2019re working hard to make that a reality.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And because of the fact that we\u2019ve been there, as I have said to you many times \u2014 we\u2019ve been there, a long time ago \u2014 it\u2019s really being done as a launch for Mars.\u00a0 Is that correct?\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0 We\u2019re building a habitat in orbit around the Moon \u2014 a space station, in orbit around the Moon.\u00a0 And that will be launching in 2022.\nAnd once that is deployed, that will be modified into a Mars ship that will take us all the way to Mars.\u00a0 And between now and then, we want to build a sustainable architecture at the Moon.\u00a0 We need to learn how to live and work on another world for long periods of time.\u00a0 And then, we go to Mars.\u00a0 Because when you go to Mars \u2014 Earth and Mars, we\u2019re only aligned on the same side of the Sun once every 24 months \u2014 or 26 months.\u00a0 What that means is we have to be willing to stay.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Right.\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:\u00a0 We need to learn how to live and work on another world.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Oh, I see.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Right.\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:\u00a0 So that\u2019s what the Moon is all about.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s going to be very interesting.\u00a0 Well, it\u2019s very exciting.\u00a0 Exciting times.\u00a0 And that whole program was dead when I took it over, when we came into office.\u00a0 And something that Mike liked very much and I liked very much.\u00a0 And you\u2019re both doing a fantastic job.\u00a0 And everybody is doing a fantastic job.\u00a0 It\u2019s been totally reinvigorated, I think, to a level that it\u2019s never been at.\nAnd we\u2019re also thinking in terms of defense.\u00a0 We have the Space Force happening.\u00a0 That\u2019s going along very nicely, as you know.\u00a0 We\u2019re creating a new force, and it\u2019s called the \u201cSpace Force.\u201d\u00a0 And that\u2019s a big thing.\u00a0 And that\u2019ll be working along very closely with you.\u00a0 So that\u2019s beyond going to the Moon and Mars.\u00a0 That\u2019s also defense of our nation, which is very important.\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0 Anywhere there\u2019s commerce, it needs to be defended.\u00a0 And we are industrializing space.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be an export for the United States.\u00a0 And that\u2019s going to be very positive.\u00a0 In fact, it already is.\u00a0 We need to grow it.\u00a0 And so we\u2019re working very hard to commercialize it, make it an export.\u00a0 And, of course, that requires it to be defended just like the high seas for trade.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s fantastic.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Great job.\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much, everybody.\u00a0 That was very exciting.\u00a0 And these are two great people.\u00a0 And they put themselves at risk for our nation and because they love doing it.\u00a0 And there are few people that have the ability to something like that, I will say that.\u00a0 It takes a great ability.\nSo thank you all for being here.\u00a0 It\u2019s very nice.\u00a0 Thank you.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, do you mind clarifying what Mick Mulvaney said yesterday?\u00a0 Was the aid \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think he \u2014 I think he clarified it.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 to Ukraine contingent upon investigating the Democrats?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And I do have to say this: We, yesterday, had a tremendous day in Texas.\u00a0 We opened a Louis Vuitton plant.\u00a0 One of the great brands of the world.\u00a0 And they opened it right in the heart of Texas.\u00a0 Lone Star State.\u00a0 And then, we went over to Dallas and had an event like few people have ever seen.\u00a0 We had a packed arena with thousands and thousands of people outside.\u00a0 It was an incredible evening.\u00a0 Got back very, very late.\nI did actually get to hear about Ambassador Kent.\u00a0 This is the witch hunt, you know.\u00a0 Their \u2014 their Crooked Schiff is coming after the Republican Party.\u00a0 He\u2019s coming after the Republican Party as hard as he can, considering he\u2019s really \u2014 he\u2019s been compromised very sadly and badly because of the fact, as you know \u2014 I think, as the press knows \u2014 he made a statement and he made a virtual speech about what I said, and then it turned out that I didn\u2019t say any of it because he fraudulently made this statement to Congress.\nI thought what he did was one of the worst things.\u00a0 I understand he has immunity, but he doesn\u2019t have immunity when he puts it on his Twitter, which he did.\u00a0 And he doesn\u2019t have immunity when he speaks to press, which he did.\u00a0 And he certainly won\u2019t have immunity if we ever get him into Congress and can swear him under oath.\u00a0 Because what he did was a very bad thing.\nBut what just happened is, Ambassador Kent \u2014 who I have never had the privilege, I don\u2019t believe, of meeting; I don\u2019t know him \u2014 and they brought him in as a witness against me, even though I don\u2019t know him.\u00a0 And he excoriated, from what they reported on the news \u2014 and, of course, maybe, in this case, it won\u2019t be fake news \u2014 but he excoriated the Obama administration and Joe Biden and Joe Biden\u2019s son, saying that he has tremendous problems \u2014 tremendous problems with Joe Biden\u2019s son and the Ukraine.\nSo he\u2019s got tremendous problems with Biden\u2019s son and Ukraine.\u00a0 And it\u2019s inappropriate.\u00a0 And all of the horrible things \u2014 I mean, you could get it; you could see it.\u00a0 It\u2019s been a big deal.\u00a0 And I heard Schiff is going, \u201cNo, no.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want to talk about that.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want to talk about that.\u201d\u00a0 But he talked about it.\u00a0 And it\u2019s one of those things.\u00a0 So, this is a terrible witch hunt.\u00a0 This is so bad for our country.\nI just spoke to President Erdo\u011fan of Turkey.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing very, very well with Turkey.\u00a0 There\u2019s a ceasefire, or a pause, or whatever you want to call it.\u00a0 There was some sniper fire this morning.\u00a0 There was mortar fire this morning that was eliminated quickly.\u00a0 And they\u2019re back to the full pause.\nWe have ISIS totally under guard.\u00a0 Turkey is also guarding, separately.\u00a0 They\u2019re watching over everything.\u00a0 So you have the Kurds, who we\u2019re dealing with and are very happy about the way things are going, I must say.\u00a0 The Kurds.\u00a0 And you also have the Turks watching, just secondarily watching.\u00a0 So we have ISIS under control.\nWe\u2019ve taken control of the oil in the Middle East, the oil that we\u2019re talking about; the oil that everybody was worried about.\u00a0 We have \u2014 the U.S. has control of that.\u00a0 And there are no shots being fired.\u00a0 And a lot of people are doing a lot of things.\nThis is a deal that should have been made 15 years ago, 10 years ago, over the last number of years, under the Obama administration.\u00a0 The real number is over a million people were killed.\u00a0 We have lost no \u2014 not a drop of blood since we\u2019ve started what I\u2019ve started.\u00a0 And it was \u2014 so far, it\u2019s working out.\nLook, it\u2019s a complicated region.\u00a0 Many, many people have gone down.\u00a0 I have to watch in great interest as I see people talking about what we should be doing.\u00a0 And these are the same people that have been failing for the last 20 years, didn\u2019t know what they were doing, especially when they went in and did what they did.\u00a0 They shouldn\u2019t have been there.\nBut we\u2019re doing a very, very significant amount of great work.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see if it works.\u00a0 It\u2019s very fragile.\u00a0 It\u2019s been fragile for years.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been fighting each other for centuries.\u00a0 Literally, for centuries, they\u2019ve been fighting each other.\u00a0 And years ago, we injected ourselves right into the middle of it.\u00a0 And we won\u2019t go into whether or not that was a good thing or a bad thing.\u00a0 You know how I feel about it.\nBut we\u2019ve had tremendous success, I think, over the last couple of days.\u00a0 A little bit unconventional, a little bit of hard love.\u00a0 I told you that.\u00a0 A little \u2014 there was a lot \u2014 a lot of pain for a couple of days.\u00a0 And sometimes you have to go through some pain before you can get a good solution.\u00a0 But the Kurds are very happy about it.\u00a0 President Erdo\u011fan and Turkey is satisfied with it.\u00a0 And we are in a very strong position.\nWe are also in a position where we can put tremendous, powerful sanctions on Turkey or whoever else we want to.\u00a0 Our country is a financially much stronger country than when I took it over.\u00a0 China would have been, right now, the strongest economy in the world, the number-one economy in the world.\u00a0 And right now, China is way behind us.\u00a0 We picked up trillions of dollars in value, in worth.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve lost trillions and trillions of dollars.\u00a0 And they\u2019re having the worst year they\u2019ve had in 57 years.\nWith that being said, we\u2019re working with China very well.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done, subject to getting it signed \u2014 and I think it will get signed quite easily, hopefully by the summit in Chile, where President Xi and I will both be.\nBut a lot of good things are happening.\u00a0 Our farmers are taken care of.\u00a0 Our bankers and financial services are going to have access, the likes of which they\u2019ve never had to \u2014 the largest or second largest, depending on your definitions.\u00a0 About 1.4 billion people, population, whether it\u2019s India or China.\u00a0 They\u2019re pretty close.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve done some great things.\nSo, we had \u2014 but, I just want to say, I want to thank the people of Dallas and the people of Fort Worth and the people of Texas, because yesterday was incredible.\nI want to thank Bernard Arnault, one of the great businessmen of the world, for agreeing to do something that was a first.\u00a0 He\u2019s built this incredible plant right in our great state of Texas.\u00a0 And they\u2019re going to make super luxury and super product.\u00a0 They have already started.\u00a0 It\u2019s opened.\u00a0 A big investment. \u00a0And we\u2019re very proud of it.\nThat was done with me and with the election with \u2014 even prior to the election, I said, \u201cYou have to open up a plant someplace in the United States.\u201d\u00a0 He said, \u201cWhat do you think about Texas?\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cI love Texas.\u00a0 That would be good.\u201d\u00a0 And I said, \u201cIf you do it, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d\u00a0 And so I fulfilled that commitment.\u00a0 But he opened up a beautiful plant.\u00a0 We think over 1,000 people will soon be working there.\nSo, thank you all very much.\u00a0 Yesterday was a big day.\u00a0 We had a great talk with President Erdo\u011fan, and it\u2019s going very well.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nEND\n12:45 P.M.

great gentleman, a great businessman.\u00a0 And he\u2019s really an artist.\u00a0 To me, Bernard is an artist.\u00a0 And what he\u2019s done is incredible, not only here, but in terms of the branding \u2014 the world of brands.\u00a0 And it\u2019s an honor to have him in Texas.\u00a0 And he\u2019s going to be very happy.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Tomorrow, there will be tariffs on European products.\u00a0 Why do you want to tax French wines and French cheese?\u00a0 And why won\u2019t you tax Mr. Arnault\u2019s handbags or champagne?\u00a0 For example \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I can\u2019t tax him because he moved to the United States.\u00a0 So he was \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did you discuss it?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 He was way ahead.\u00a0 I actually did discuss it.\u00a0 He has no tariffs whatsoever because he\u2019s in the United States.\u00a0 So we\u2019re very happy about that.\u00a0 Very happy.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What about the wines and the cheese?\u00a0 Why \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, that\u2019s a different story, but \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sure.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 But they owe us a lot of money.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you have confidence in Mick Mulvaney, Mr. President?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did you watch Mick Mulvaney\u2019s press conference, Mr. President?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I didn\u2019t.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t able to see it.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you aware that he suggested that there was some sort of a quid pro quo involved in Ukraine?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I didn\u2019t.\u00a0 I heard he \u2014 somebody said he did a very nice job.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you know when Rick Perry is going to leave?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You know what I\u2019ve been focused on today, very much?\u00a0 All of this, and also, if you look, Turkey and the great thing that happened in Syria.\nI don\u2019t know.\u00a0 But Mick is a good man.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I have not heard anything about that.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you still have confidence in Mick?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I have a lot of confidence.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 About Syria, Mr. Trump, are you very satisfied with the ceasefire?\u00a0 Is it the end of the crisis?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think this is beautiful.\u00a0 I really think this is beautiful.\u00a0 I think the plant is incredible, and a great company.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, did Rick Perry offer his resignation to you, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I know Rick has been with me three years.\u00a0 He\u2019s right here.\u00a0 He\u2019s with us, right here.\u00a0 And he\u2019s been outstanding.\u00a0 And we already have his replacement.\u00a0 Rick has a done a fantastic job in energy.\u00a0 But it was time.\u00a0 Yeah, three years is a long time.\u00a0 And he\u2019ll be leaving toward the end of the year \u2014 at the end of the year.\nBut his \u2014 in fact, I was going to announce it tonight at the rally in Texas.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Who are you looking at?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We have the man that we\u2019re going to \u2014 it\u2019s a man, in this case, we\u2019re going to be putting in Rick\u2019s place.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be announcing it very shortly.\u00a0 Okay?\nHow are you?\u00a0 How are you?\u00a0 Good job, you do.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 About the ceasefire, Mr. Trump, it\u2019s a big deal.\u00a0 How did you manage to get it?\u00a0 Is it the end of the crisis?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 This is a great deal.\u00a0 This is a great deal for Texas and for our country.\u00a0 And to have this incredible company and brand in Texas is an honor for all us.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No, but I mean with Syria.\u00a0 What you got today \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re very happy.\u00a0 And I want to thank President Erdo\u011fan of Turkey.\u00a0 I want to thank all of the leaders of the Kurds.\u00a0 Many people came into store for this.\u00a0 And it was unconventional, but they saw that was not working out, what they were doing.\u00a0 And we\u2019re very happy with the way that worked out.\u00a0 Very, very successful.\nAnd now, over the next number of days, things are going to happen that are going to be very positive.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of goodwill going on right now in Turkey with the Kurds and with everybody involved.\u00a0 Many, many people are involved.\u00a0 But I want to thank Mike Pence.\u00a0 I want to thank Mike Pompeo.\u00a0 They did a fantastic job.\u00a0 All of my representatives who went over there two days ago, late in the evening, and got there \u2014 and not easy to do, and little bit dangerous to do, also \u2014 they did a fantastic job.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And do you think it\u2019s solved?\u00a0 It\u2019s over?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, I do.\u00a0 I think it\u2019ll all work out now.\u00a0 I think they needed an unconventional touch.\u00a0 And I am very unconventional, right?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Were you surprised by Rick Perry\u2019s announcement \u2014 decision?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I knew six months ago.\u00a0 He told me at the end of the year he\u2019d like to go.\u00a0 And he\u2019s got some ideas for doing something else.\u00a0 He\u2019s a terrific guy.\u00a0 He\u2019s here with us now.\u00a0 Here\u2019s here.\u00a0 He\u2019s right here.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can we talk to him?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So what happened on the plane today?\u00a0 Did he just formalize it and hand you the letter?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 With what?\u00a0 Rick?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, no.\u00a0 Rick and I have been talking for six months.\u00a0 In fact, I thought he might go a little bit sooner.\u00a0 But he\u2019s got some very big plans.\u00a0 He\u2019s going to be very successful.\u00a0 We have his successor.\u00a0 We\u2019ll announce it pretty soon.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is it Governor Abbott?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 He\u2019d be a good one.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is it the Governor of Alaska?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I\u2019ll tell you, he would be a \u2014 they would be both be very good.\u00a0 No, it\u2019s not.\u00a0 But they both would be very good.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you have any comment, sir, for Fort Worth, on the death of Atatiana Jefferson, the woman who was found killed in her home?\u00a0 You just came from Fort Worth.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I think it was terrible.\u00a0 I think it was a terrible thing.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You have very low unemployment rate in the U.S., and we have a very high unemployment rate in France.\u00a0 How come?\u00a0 What\u2019s the recipe for \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, maybe we have a better President than you do.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you any closer to sending Anne Sacoolas back to the UK?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\nEND\n5:03 P.M.

        "text": "Ramstein Air Base\nRamstein-Miesenbach, Germany\n1:02 A.M. CEST\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, hello, Ramstein!\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you all for being up so late.\u00a0 I just couldn\u2019t pass through without having a chance to meet as many of you as I could.\u00a0 To General Jeffrey Harrigian, Lieutenant General Steven Basham, Major General John Wood, Colonel Matthew Husemann, but most especially to all of the outstanding men and women wearing the uniform of the United States Air Force and all of our Armed Forces: Thank you for coming out tonight.\u00a0 And thank you for your service.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIt really is an honor to be back \u2014 to be back at Ramstein Air Base with the men and women of the 435th Air Ground Operations Wing \u2014 (applause) \u2014 the 521st Air Mobility Operations Wing \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and, of course, the enduring courage of the 86th Airlift Wing.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYou know, I know it\u2019s awful late here tonight, y\u2019all stayed up late to see me, and I\u2019m very honored by that.\u00a0 I really am.\u00a0 Giving me this warm welcome to Ramstein.\u00a0 So \u2014 I don\u2019t know about you, General Harrigian, but it looks to me like these airmen might just have earned a three-day weekend.\u00a0 What do you say?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I had to suggest it.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut speaking of people that admire all of you, allow me to bring greetings tonight from a great admirer of all the men and women who wear the uniform of the Armed Forces of the United States, a great champion of our military and their families.\u00a0 I bring greetings from your Commander-in-Chief, the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd I\u2019m looking forward to meeting as many of you as time permits tonight.\u00a0 But I really just wanted to stop by, on behalf of your President and his Vice President, and a grateful nation, to deliver a very simple message to each and every one of you:\u00a0 The United States Armed Forces is the greatest force for good the world has ever known.\u00a0 And you are that force.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd I promise you, men and women, your Commander-in-Chief, his number two, and the American people are proud of you.\u00a0 This country is more thankful for the service that you render every day than you will ever know.\u00a0 But, first and foremost, thank you for your service.\nYou know, many people spend all their lives wondering if \u2014 if they\u2019ve made a difference.\u00a0 But you\u2019ll never have that problem.\u00a0 Because each and every one you stepped up.\u00a0 You raised your right hand.\u00a0 You swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America and defend the American people.\u00a0 You chose to be a part of something larger than yourselves.\u00a0 You joined this all-volunteer military.\u00a0 And as the Good Book says: You did not love your lives so much as to shrink from this calling.\nTruthfully, the day you took that oath, you decided that our lives were more important than yours.\u00a0 And I want you to know the American people understand that and admire you deeply.\u00a0 You have chosen to do your part to keep the flame of freedom alive.\u00a0 And I want you to know that you have your Commander-in-Chief\u2019s and my own deepest respect for your courage and your valor.\u00a0 So give yourselves a round of applause because America is proud of you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThe truth is, you come from the rest of us, but you are the best of us \u2014 heroes all. \u00a0And I\u2019m here not only to say thank you for your service, but to also assure you that you have a Commander-in-Chief who will always have your back.\u00a0 I truly believe, serving alongside him every single day, that President Donald Trump is the greatest friend the United States Armed Forces have ever had.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI mean, from the earliest days of our administration, our President has taken decisive action to make the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still.\nIn our first year in office, President Trump signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan, including the biggest pay raise for our troops in more than 10 years.\u00a0 And you deserved every single penny.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAs the President said not long ago, our active-duty personnel are now the best-equipped, best-trained, and most technologically advanced fighting force in the history of the world.\u00a0 And it\u2019s true.\u00a0 And with this renewed American strength, we\u2019re once again embracing America\u2019s role as leader of the free world.\nUnder this President\u2019s leadership, and by virtue of your service, we\u2019re standing with our allies and we\u2019re standing up to our enemies.\nHere in Europe, I\u2019m proud to report that our NATO Allies are contributing more to our common defense than ever before.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 As the home of the United States Air Forces-Europe, your service here at this historic base supports NATO missions all over the world.\u00a0 You support our armed forces, our allies, and our partners on three continents, it\u2019s amazing to think, and 124 countries.\u00a0 And you make it possible to move troops and supplies wherever they need to be, anywhere in the world, 24/7, 365 days a year.\nRamstein Air Base is the heart of the American military on the European continent, and the free world is safer because of all of you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd speaking of security, I\u2019m pleased to report to all of my fellow Americans that, just a few hours ago, at President Trump\u2019s direction, we concluded a successful negotiation in Turkey that directly impacts missions that you support here at Ramstein Air Base every day.\nAs you all know, one week ago, Turkish forces crossed into Syria.\u00a0 Earlier this week, President Trump took decisive action and called on Turkey to stand down, to end the violence, and agree to come to the table for negotiations.\nAnd today, I\u2019m proud to report, thanks to the President\u2019s strong leadership, the United States and Turkey have agreed to a ceasefire in Syria.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd I know all of you here at Ramstein Air Base have been vital to our mission in that region for years.\u00a0 The progress that we made today, I believe, is directly owing to the work that all of you have labored so nobly to advance here.\nYou played a vital role in the campaign to defeat ISIS.\u00a0 And today, we have a framework for peace in that region of Syria that will bring security to our allies in Turkey, our allies in Syrian Defence Forces, and it\u2019ll advance peace and security for all the men, women, and children who have suffered for years of war and terror.\u00a0 It is progress being built on your service here at Ramstein.\nAs you stand your post, I want you to know that your Commander-in-Chief, and all of the American people, are behind you 100 percent.\nYou know, I say that from a grateful heart, but I also say that with true humility.\u00a0 It\u2019s always humbling for me to stand before men and women who wear that the uniform of the United States because my life did not take me into service in our armed forces.\u00a0 I\u2019m proud to say I\u2019m the son of a combat veteran from the Korean War in the Army.\u00a0 And Karen and I are the proud parents of a United States Marine.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And if it helps, my daughter just got engaged to a Navy pilot.\u00a0 So I\u2019ll soon be the father-in-law of a Naval aviator as well.\nBut, you know, as I stand before you today, I often think it might be altogether fitting for an American like me to come before you, simply to speak a word of gratitude \u2014 not so much as your Vice President, but just as a fellow American; a fellow American who lives under the umbrella of protection that you provide from here in Ramstein and across the free world, every day.\nBut I want to leave you with this admonition, even at this late hour.\u00a0 On behalf of your Commander-in-Chief, I want to urge all of you: Mind your mission, stay sharp, be vigilant, respect the unified chain of command, take care of each other \u2014 especially those under your command \u2014 and you will succeed in serving this country with distinction.\nAnd as you do this, never doubt for one second that the service that you render here on this continent so far from home matters more to the American people than you will ever know.\nThe American people are grateful for your service because we know that your service comes with sacrifice for you and for your families.\u00a0 You\u2019ve stepped forward in a calling that has, as I said before, counted our lives more important than your own.\nBut I want to assure you, as you go forth, defending America and defending freedom here at this outpost in Europe: In those times that it may seem a little too far from home, and those times that you may \u2014 you may feel a sense of loneliness or separation, just know that you do not bear this burden you carry alone.\nAs you serve here, I want to assure you that wherever you are called to serve, wherever you are deployed, you will carry with you the strength and pride of the American people.\u00a0 You will carry with you the confidence of your Commander-in-Chief.\u00a0 And I also know that, every day, you are carried by the prayers of the American people.\nI know, as I travel across this country, when I\u2019m home, that the prayers of the faithful carry the men and women of our armed forces every day.\u00a0 The American people will continue to pray as you serve and protect our nation.\nWe pray that, as the Old Book says, \u201cNo harm would befall you, no plague would come near your tent,\u201d and that as you serve on the ground or in the skies that His \u2014 that, \u201cHe would command his angels concerning you to watch over you in all your ways.\u201d\u00a0 And that\u2019ll be our prayer, as I know it is the prayer of millions.\nSo, to the men and women of Ramstein Air Base, thank you for staying up so late to greet your Vice President.\u00a0 I\u2019m honored to be with you today.\u00a0 I look forward to meeting as many of you as time permits.\nBut I have to tell you, I leave here today, even at this hour, with renewed confidence, looking at all your shining faces and the grit and resolve that I see in your eyes.\u00a0 And I know, as long as we have men and women like you with the courage to step forward and serve; as long as we have heroes willing to put your lives on the line for freedom; as long as we have patriots, like all of you, to defend our nation, I know America will be safe, our freedom will be secure, and the best days for the greatest nation on Earth are yet to come.\nSo, God bless you.\u00a0 God bless Ramstein Air Base.\u00a0 And God bless America.\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEND\n1:17 A.M.

CDT\nTHE PRESIDENT: \u00a0Well, thank you very much.\u00a0 I\u2019m very happy to report tremendous success, with respect to Turkey.\u00a0 And I want to thank President Erdo\u011fan.\u00a0 I want to thank our Vice President Mike Pence, our Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\u00a0 Great job.\u00a0 All of the people that we sent over the last three days.\u00a0 We sent an early group.\nThis is an amazing outcome.\u00a0 This is an outcome \u2014 regardless of how the press would like to damp it down, this was something that they\u2019ve been trying to get for 10 years.\u00a0 You would have lost millions and millions of lives.\u00a0 They couldn\u2019t get it without a little rough love, as I called it.\u00a0 I just put out \u2014 they needed a little bit of that at the beginning.\u00a0 And then everybody said, \u201cWow, this is tougher than we thought.\u201d\u00a0 When those guns start shooting, they tend to do things.\nBut I will tell you, on behalf of the United States, I want to thank Turkey.\u00a0 I want to thank all of the people that have gotten together and made this happen.\u00a0 This is an incredible outcome.\nSo you have a 22-mile strip.\u00a0 And for many, many years, Turkey \u2014 in all fairness, they\u2019ve had a legitimate problem with it.\u00a0 They had terrorists.\u00a0 They had a lot of people in there that they couldn\u2019t have.\u00a0 They\u2019ve suffered a lot of loss of lives also.\u00a0 And they had to have it cleaned out.\u00a0 But once you start that, it gets to be to a point where a tremendous amount of bad things can happen.\nSo a process started and we started to negotiate.\u00a0 And I think that, obviously, the sanctions and tariffs were going to be very biting.\u00a0 I\u2019m glad we don\u2019t have to do it.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be taking them off very quickly, as soon as this is finalized.\nBut this is an incredible outcome.\u00a0 This outcome is something they\u2019ve been trying to get for 10 years \u2014 everybody \u2014 and they couldn\u2019t get it, other administrations.\u00a0 And they never would\u2019ve been able to get it unless you went somewhat unconventional.\u00a0 I guess I\u2019m an unconventional person.\nI took a lot of heat from a lot of people, even some of the people in my own party, but they were there.\u00a0 In the end, they were there.\u00a0 They\u2019re all there.\u00a0 Look, this is about the nation.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t about Republicans or Democrats.\u00a0 This is about our nation.\nSo, we have a five-day ceasefire.\u00a0 During that five days, the Kurds and other people \u2014 they\u2019re going to be taken great care of.\u00a0 They\u2019re going to be moving around \u2014 moving out of a safe zone, which is something that Turkey has always wanted.\nThe ISIS \u2014 they call them \u201cDaesh,\u201d but we call them \u201cISIS.\u201d\u00a0 The ISIS fighters that we have captured, they\u2019ll be under very, very strict control of various different groups.\u00a0 But we will be watching, we will be in charge, and they\u2019ll be under very, very powerful and strict control.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve gotten everything we could\u2019ve ever dreamed of, and we\u2019re also going to be able to bring our people back home.\u00a0 But we\u2019ll be able to have control of ISIS \u2014 total.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be able to do whatever we have to do to get the rest of ISIS, wherever they may be.\u00a0 They\u2019re never going to be ruling us.\nAnd I want to thank everybody.\u00a0 And the other thing, I want thank \u2014 as a group, I want to thank the Kurds because they were incredibly happy with this solution.\u00a0 This is a solution that really \u2014 well, it saved their lives, frankly.\u00a0 It saved their lives.\nSo we\u2019ve done a great thing for our partner.\u00a0 If we didn\u2019t go this unconventional, tough-love approach, you could\u2019ve never gotten it done.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been trying to do this for many, many years.\u00a0 You could\u2019ve never gotten it done.\nSo, I want to thank everybody.\u00a0 I want to thank everybody back in Washington.\nWe\u2019re in Texas now and we\u2019re going to be opening up a phenomenal new plant.\u00a0 One of the greatest men in business \u2014 in all of business \u2014 is here with us.\u00a0 You know who he is.\nAnd they\u2019re opening up a plant in Texas.\u00a0 The first time, I believe \u2014 one of the great companies of the world \u2014 first time ever in the United States.\u00a0 And then we\u2019re having a big rally in Dallas tonight at the American Airlines Center.\u00a0 So we look forward to that.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been \u2014 they\u2019ve been standing on line for three days, as you know.\u00a0 So it\u2019s a record crowd over in Dallas.\nBut I didn\u2019t know it was going to work out this quickly.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know it would work out this well.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great day for the United States.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great day for Turkey.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great day for our partners, who have really worked.\u00a0 I mean, a lot of people questioned some of them; I\u2019m not questioning anybody.\u00a0 They really did.\u00a0 The Kurds were great.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great day for the Kurds.\u00a0 It\u2019s really a great day for civilization.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great day for civilization.\nSo I just want to thank everybody.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you expect Congress now to call off their sanctions effort?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, sanctions won\u2019t be necessary because Turkey is doing what they\u2019re doing.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t need Congress for sanctions because I can do sanctions that are tougher than Congress.\u00a0 And I was prepared to do that.\nI just want to thank and congratulate though, President Erdo\u011fan.\u00a0 He\u2019s a friend of mine and I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have a problem.\u00a0 Because, frankly, he\u2019s a hell of a leader, and he\u2019s a tough man.\u00a0 He\u2019s a strong man.\u00a0 And he did the right thing, and I really appreciate it.\u00a0 And I will appreciate it in the future.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, isn\u2019t Turkey getting everything they want from this?\u00a0 Don\u2019t they effectively just get control of the safe zone?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, Turkey has a great military power.\u00a0 Turkey is a friend of ours, a neighbor of ours, and they\u2019re a member of NATO.\u00a0 And what Turkey is getting now is they\u2019re not going to have to kill millions of people, and millions of people aren\u2019t going to have to kill them.\nI mean, this was going to be a war of lots of other groups coming in; this wasn\u2019t going to stop with Turkey against the Kurds.\u00a0 A lot of different groups were coming in.\u00a0 We might not have been involved.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to be involved in that kind of a war.\nAnd, by the way, we have the strongest military in the world.\u00a0 But we\u2019ve been there for 10 years.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been in the Middle East for nineteen and a half years.\u00a0 So this was a great thing for everybody.\u00a0 And Turkey is \u2014 I really appreciate what they\u2019ve done.\u00a0 They did the right thing.\u00a0 And I have a great respect for the President.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Your decision not to keep any of the sanctions in place \u2014 doesn\u2019t that effectively let Turkey just get off with no punishment for this incursion?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 No.\u00a0 If you let this go, you would\u2019ve lost millions of lives.\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget: Your friend, President Obama, lost more than a half a million lives in a very short period in the same reason \u2014 region.\u00a0 We\u2019ve lost very little.\nBut without that gunfire going back and forth, without those rockets going in both directions, without other countries moving in, and potentially moving in and creating virtually a world war \u2014 without all of that happening, you would\u2019ve never been able to make this deal.\nWe\u2019ve tried \u2014 we have tried, but everybody has tried to make this deal for 15 years.\u00a0 They could never do it.\u00a0 It was only when it started \u2014 people started seeing how nasty it was going to be.\u00a0 It was going to be very nasty.\u00a0 Not only sanctions and tariffs, the war itself would\u2019ve been very nasty.\nSo, they did things that they wouldn\u2019t have done.\u00a0 I just put out. \u00a0Everything agreed to things that, three days ago, they would have never agreed to.\u00a0 That includes the Kurds.\u00a0 The Kurds are now much more inclined to do what has to be done.\u00a0 Turkey is much more inclined to do what has to be done.\u00a0 Turkey wouldn\u2019t have done this three days ago.\u00a0 The Kurds would not have done it three days ago.\nThis is a situation where everybody is happy.\u00a0 And I\u2019m happy because there\u2019s no fighting.\u00a0 We can bring certainly most of our people back home for the first time in many years.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, you\u2019re talking about all of this shooting as though it was part of plan.\u00a0 Are you saying that you planned for these people to attack each other so you could resolve it?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 No.\u00a0 But I do think this, David: I think it had to be an unconventional solution.\u00a0 Because the conventional solution is to sit down, negotiate, and they\u2019ve done that for 15 years.\u00a0 Actually more than that, I understand.\u00a0 And that was never going to work.\nBut all of a sudden when they saw \u2014 and how nasty it was and how rough it would get; it would get 100 times worse than what was happening.\u00a0 But when they saw the level of nastiness, they said, \u201cLet\u2019s make a deal \u2014 everybody together.\u00a0 Let\u2019s make a deal.\u201d\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you sure that this will last more than five days?\u00a0 A lot of stuff can disappear in five days.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think so.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s going to last.\u00a0 I think that President Erdo\u011fan is very smart.\u00a0 I think he wants it to last.\u00a0 He wants safety for his people.\nLook, say what you want.\u00a0 A lot of bad things happened to Turkey from that district, from that 22-mile stretch.\u00a0 A lot of people in Turkey were killed.\u00a0 So that\u2019s not fair.\u00a0 Nobody likes to mention that.\u00a0 This was a great thing for the Kurds.\u00a0 This was a great thing for Turkey.\u00a0 This is great for everybody.\nAnd, frankly, the thing that I\u2019m most happy about is that we were \u2014 I took a lot of heat \u2014 but that we were able to do it so fast.\u00a0 I thought this would go on for longer.\u00a0 This was such a smart thing to get it done so fast.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is President Erdo\u011fan still coming next month to the White House?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, now I would say that would be very much open.\u00a0 I would say that, yeah, he would come.\u00a0 He did a terrific thing.\u00a0 He\u2019s a leader.\u00a0 He\u2019s a leader.\u00a0 He had to make a decision.\u00a0 A lot of people wouldn\u2019t have made that decision because they don\u2019t know; they ultimately would\u2019ve made it.\u00a0 But what he did was very smart and it was great for the people of Turkey.\u00a0 And they\u2019re lucky it was him that was making the decision, I will tell you that.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The U.S. military \u2014 will you leave anybody in this zone to help monitor this ceasefire?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have people that watch it.\u00a0 And most particularly, we\u2019re going to have people that are watching ISIS.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have people watching.\u00a0 And ISIS will be largely again controlled by the Kurds.\u00a0 Because what a lot of people don\u2019t know: Most of the areas where ISIS is, is outside of the war zone or the 22 miles.\nSo ISIS will be \u2014 very few have gotten out.\u00a0 Most of them have been recaptured.\u00a0 And what\u2019s happened is ISIS is outside of the war zone.\u00a0 So that\u2019s going to be controlled very much by the Kurds, with our supervision.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And the Kurdish general, General Mazloum, who you talked to before \u2014 are you going to talk to him again to get him to \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 He\u2019s very happy.\u00a0 They\u2019ve spoken to him.\u00a0 The Kurds are very happy.\u00a0 Turkey is very happy.\u00a0 The United States is very happy.\u00a0 And you know what?\u00a0 Civilization is very happy.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great thing for civilization.\nThank you, everybody.\nEND\n"

CDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much, everybody.\u00a0 Very, very much appreciated.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a tremendous day today in the Middle East.\u00a0 We were a little bit unconventional, and we did something that nobody has been able to do for many, many years.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been trying to put things together.\u00a0 So we went the unconventional way, and they had some fighting and they said, \u201cWe don\u2019t like this fighting too much.\u00a0 This is a little more difficult than people thought.\u201d\nBut I want to thank President Erdo\u011fan of Turkey, and I want to thank the Kurds and Kurd leadership.\u00a0 I want to thank certain other countries that, behind the scenes, were helping us out.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a tremendous thing.\nISIS is totally under control, and we\u2019re continuing to capture more.\u00a0 We have a tremendous situation worked out in so many different ways.\u00a0 And it\u2019s an honor to have been involved in it.\nI want to thank Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Pompeo.\u00a0 They traveled through the night.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know how safe this travel was.\u00a0 I had a lot of different reports going on.\u00a0 But they got there, and they did a fantastic job.\nWe sent some early representatives to the site and the area where they negotiated, and we made a deal that\u2019s, I think, in the best interest of civilization.\u00a0 It\u2019s beyond Turkey and beyond Syria and beyond all of the countries that could have been involved in a disastrous war where millions of people could\u2019ve been killed.\u00a0 Millions and millions of people could\u2019ve been killed.\u00a0 And we were able to do something, and I think we\u2019ll get it done, and I think now we get it done.\nSo we have a pause for a period of time \u2014 a ceasefire, a pause.\u00a0 And during that pause, a lot of things are happening.\u00a0 Already, they\u2019re starting to happen.\u00a0 People want to see it happen.\u00a0 And it was a great thing.\u00a0 So I just wanted to thank everybody.\nAnd, Bernard, I want to thank you for the incredible job you do.\u00a0 You\u2019re one of the truly great business people but, really, visionaries.\u00a0 It\u2019s much more than a business person.\u00a0 I know a lot of great business people, but they\u2019re not necessarily visionaries.\u00a0 There are very few.\u00a0 You\u2019re an artist and a visionary, and I want to congratulate you because this is a great vision that you had for the state of Texas and for our country.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nToday, we continue the extraordinary revival of American manufacturing, and we proudly celebrate the opening of the brand-new Louis Vuitton \u2014 a name I know very well.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It cost me a lot of money over the years.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It\u2019s a workshop right here in Johnson County, Texas.\nWe\u2019re honored to be joined today \u2014 (applause) \u2014 thank you.\u00a0 We\u2019re honored to be joined today by some of the great members of my Cabinet.\u00a0 They wanted to be here.\u00a0 This is a very important event.\u00a0 And we really do \u2014 we work very hard on jobs.\u00a0 Our country is setting records on jobs in so many ways.\nWe have Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.\u00a0 Wilbur, thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Labor Secretary Gene Scalia.\u00a0 Gene.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Gene.\u00a0 And a very good friend of mine who\u2019s been with me right from the beginning, and somebody that\u2019s going to be going, I guess, at the end of the year.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to miss you so much.\u00a0 A man who has been your long-term, talented governor, Energy Secretary Rick Perry.\u00a0 Rick, fantastic job.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Fantastic.\u00a0 Stand up, Rick.\u00a0 He\u2019s done a fantastic job for a long period of time, and we really appreciate it.\nThe Department of Energy has far, far progressed from those days three years ago when you took it over.\u00a0 So, thank you very much.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be announcing the replacement.\u00a0 And he, I think \u2014 it\u2019s a \u201che\u201d in this particular case \u2014 I think he\u2019ll do a fantastic job.\u00a0 We worked on that together.\u00a0 Right, Rick?\u00a0 So thank you very much.\nAlso joining us is your great Congressman, Roger Williams \u2014 a friend of mine, a very brave gentleman, too.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, Roger.\u00a0 And \u2014 is this your territory, Roger, huh?\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 I\u2019ve known him for so long, and now I go to your territory.\u00a0 Now I see why they like you, and I know why they like you, Roger.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nREPRESENTATIVE WILLIAMS:\u00a0 They like you too.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I hope so.\u00a0 They better.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It\u2019s Texas.\u00a0 They like me in Texas, I will say.\nAnd our terrific U.S. Ambassador to France, Jamie McCourt.\u00a0 Jamie, thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Great job.\nBut we\u2019re especially grateful to Bernard and everyone at Louis Vuitton and the Louis Vuitton family: Alexander \u2014 I\u2019ve gotten to know Alexander.\u00a0 He is going to be something.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know, he may surpass you.\u00a0 Do you mind that?\u00a0 No, I don\u2019t think so, right?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 He\u2019s a special young man.\u00a0 And Global Chairman \u2014 thank you very much, Alexander.\u00a0 Where are you?\u00a0 We don\u2019t lose him much with that height.\u00a0 Well, how tall are you, Alex?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Huh?\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 Thank you very much. \u00a0Great job you\u2019re doing.\nAnd Global Chairman and CEO Michael Burke.\u00a0 Michael, thank you very much.\u00a0 Good job.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Been with the company a long time, I understand.\u00a0 Four-oh?\u00a0 Is that true?\u00a0 Forty?\u00a0 Forty years.\u00a0 He said before, he was as tall as Alexander when he started.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Great job.\nAnd Chairman and CEO for North America, Anish Melwani.\u00a0 Where is \u2014 thank you very much.\u00a0 Great job you do.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAlso, the President and CEO of Louis Vuitton Americas Zone, Lanessa Elrod.\u00a0 Thank you, Lanessa.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nI want to thank you all for your confidence in the United States and your confidence and investment in the Lone Star State, the great state of Texas.\u00a0 You\u2019ll be very happy.\u00a0 You\u2019ll be very, very happy.\nAs Bernard mentioned, we met shortly after the election to discuss my vision for creating an American manufacturing renaissance through historic tax cuts, and better trade deals, and deregulation.\u00a0 And we\u2019re making trade deals like nobody has ever seen before.\u00a0 We just did one with China, phase one.\u00a0 We\u2019ll get it signed very quickly, for the farmers.\u00a0 Far, far bigger than anyone ever thought possible.\u00a0 Also, financial services and many other things.\nBut the trade deals we\u2019ve made with South Korea, with Mexico, Canada \u2014 assuming the Democrats ever get it passed, which is a question, because they don\u2019t seem to like to make deals very much.\u00a0 They have to get that one done.\u00a0 That\u2019s a very important transaction, the USMCA.\u00a0 And we\u2019re \u2014 and has tremendous support.\nWe\u2019re joined also by Jared and Ivanka, who are both here today as \u2014 where is Ivanka?\u00a0 Jared?\u00a0 Stand up.\u00a0 What a good job you do.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Even though they\u2019re related to me, just slightly, I will tell you, what a job.\u00a0 Ivanka is responsible for 14 million jobs this year, over the last couple of years, with companies going out and training people.\u00a0 And it\u2019s been an incredible success.\nShe started off two and a half years ago; she wanted 500,000 jobs.\u00a0 That\u2019s a lot.\u00a0 But it was typical Ivanka.\u00a0 It ended up \u2014 and now, the number, I think it just crossed 14 million jobs going to Walmart, going to ExxonMobil, going to the great companies.\u00a0 And they train people.\u00a0 And the numbers are incredible, and that\u2019s one of the reasons that our numbers are so good.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nAnd, Jared, great job you\u2019re doing.\u00a0 Thank you very much, both.\nBernard had faith in that vision \u2014 the vision of doing something right here in this incredible state \u2014 and promised to bring a brand-new factory to the United States.\u00a0 And today, wow, has he delivered.\u00a0 He\u2019s really delivered.\u00a0 This is some place.\nJohnson County is home to some of the hardest-working patriots in America.\u00a0 Louis Vuitton\u2019s 50-million-dollar investment will be especially big and especially incredible to the small town of Alvarado, a community of fewer than 5,000 people.\u00a0 And this workshop, as they call it \u2014 it\u2019s a very big workshop \u2014 it\u2019s a great name though, actually.\u00a0 I could learn something from you about branding.\u00a0 I like that.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 The \u201cworkshop.\u201d\nBut this workshop will soon employ 500 of the most highly skilled workers anywhere in the world.\u00a0 No one can match the precision and perfection of an American artisan.\nWorkers here will have great pay, quality healthcare, 401(k)s.\u00a0 And, by the way, the 401(k), since my election, have gone through the roof.\u00a0 And nobody wants to see them be cut in half, go down 82 percent.\u00a0 They\u2019re going to go up.\u00a0 They\u2019re only going in one direction, but they are up 70, 80, 82, 91 percent.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been up.\u00a0 And when they go and get to go and press that lever to vote for who \u2014 I have a feeling we\u2019re going to do very well \u2014 very well \u2014 as we\u2019ve done in Texas and as we did in 2016, in Texas.\u00a0 One of the reasons I love this state so much.\u00a0 And also, profit sharing.\nEvery year, Louis Vuitton will pay more than $26 million in wages, and that number will increase even higher as the facility doubles to 1,000 workers in a very short period of time.\nEvery purse, handbag, and piece of luggage produced here in Johnson County will be made by hand, and it will bear the symbol of excellence envied all around the world.\u00a0 And it will also have \u201cMade in the USA\u201d stamped on it.\u00a0 So, we appreciate that.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Appreciate that.\u00a0 Made in the USA.\nUnder my administration, we believe that we can build it, grow it, or make it in the United States.\u00a0 And we are doing that in record numbers.\nToday, we have more people working in the United States that have ever worked in our country before.\u00a0 Almost 160 million people working with jobs and doing well.\nAfter losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, we have now gained nearly 10,000 new factories under my administration in just a very short period of time.\u00a0 And they\u2019re coming in, in droves.\nLast year, we saw the biggest increase in manufacturing jobs in more than two decades.\u00a0 Investments like the one we celebrate today have given the United States the hottest economy anywhere on Earth.\u00a0 Nobody close.\nSince the election, we have created more than 6.4 million jobs.\u00a0 We have gained 775,000 new jobs here in Texas, including more than 70,000 manufacturing jobs.\u00a0 Nearly 7 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.\u00a0 Median household income has increased by $1,400 to a new all-time high.\u00a0 And median \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen this, but it was out yesterday \u2014 median household income, it\u2019s more than $5,000 higher, and that doesn\u2019t include the tax cuts, which is another $2,000.\u00a0 That\u2019s something.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 That\u2019s something.\nUnemployment is at the lowest rate in more than half a century.\u00a0 African American and Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country.\nThe Texas unemployment rate is the lowest in our history.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t know if the governor is here right now.\u00a0 He\u2019s going to be joining me in a little while.\u00a0 But our governor has done a great job.\u00a0 Our lieutenant governor has done a fantastic job.\nOur senators \u2014 I mean, we have really \u2014 we\u2019ve got some fantastic people:\u00a0Ken, everybody.\u00a0 We\u2019ve really done a brilliant job.\u00a0 Led by the former governor, as we said.\u00a0 Because Rick was \u2014 what were you?\u00a0 Twelve years, Rick, right?\u00a0 Twelve years as the \u2014 how much?\nSECRETARY PERRY:\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 I thought you corrected me.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I hate to be corrected.\u00a0 I\u2019m glad I was \u2014 glad I was right.\nThese amazing achievements are the result of a policy that puts American workers first.\u00a0 Since our tax cuts and regulation cuts, American companies have brought nearly $1 trillion back to our shores \u2014 money that could never have come back.\u00a0 It was restricted.\u00a0 Would never have come back.\u00a0 Over a trillion \u2014 actually, it\u2019s now over a trillion dollars.\nWe\u2019ve ended the war on American energy.\u00a0 America is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, with Texas producing 30 percent more natural gas and 60 percent more oil.\u00a0 And that means more jobs, higher wages, and lower prices at the pump.\u00a0 It\u2019s an incredible number.\nWe\u2019re forging a new trade agenda based on fairness and reciprocity \u2014 maybe my favorite word: \u201creciprocal\u201d trade.\u00a0 That includes replacing NAFTA \u2014 which was a terrible deal \u2014 with a brand-new USMCA, which, if adopted, will be a massive win for the state of Texas, its ranchers, its growers, producers, farmers, and factory workers.\nCompanies around the world are realizing that there\u2019s never been a better time to hire, invest, build, and grow in the United States of America.\u00a0 This is the hottest time we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 It\u2019s incredible what\u2019s happening in our country.\nTo maintain our nation\u2019s competitive advantage, my administration started the Pledge to American Workers.\u00a0 Thanks to, again, Ivanka\u2019s leadership, in this case, private sector partners are going to be producing many, many more jobs over a very short period of time.\nAnd today, I\u2019m pleased to announce that Louis \u2014 Louis Vuitton is also signing the Pledge, ensuring an opportunity for all 1,000 Texas workers here in Johnson County.\u00a0 And I want to thank you.\u00a0 So we have 1,000 more workers that we can add onto the list.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Louis Vuitton, thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd it\u2019s truly fitting that the name of this facility is Rochambeau Ranch, named for the French general who helped General George Washington win the decisive battle of the American Revolution and secure American independence.\u00a0 That\u2019s great.\nToday, France remains not only our oldest ally, but one of our most trusted and cherished.\u00a0 We have a great relationship with France.\u00a0 We have our little disputes with Emmanuel every once in a while.\u00a0 Say hello to Emmanuel.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But we\u2019re doing very well, and France is a great country and a wonderful group of people.\u00a0 We have a lot of fun.\u00a0 And I do \u2014 I like \u2014 I like your President very much, actually.\nToday, with the help of a great French partner, we are achieving a true victory for the people of Texas and the United States.\nOnce again, I want to express my deep appreciation to everyone at Louis Vuitton and to all of our incredible, devoted, skilled, and beloved American workers.\nAnd it\u2019s now my honor to cut the ribbon and officially welcome Louis Vuitton to the great state of Texas.\nThank you, Bernard.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n(The ribbon is cut.)\u00a0 (Applause).\nEND\n5:32 P.M.

TRT\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 One week ago, Turkish forces crossed into Syria.\u00a0 Earlier this week, President Trump took decisive action to call on Turkish forces to stand down, to end the violence, to agree to negotiations.\u00a0 And today, I\u2019m proud to report, thanks to the strong leadership of President Donald Trump and the strong relationship between President Erdo\u011fan and Turkey and the United States of America, that today, the United States and Turkey have agreed to a ceasefire in Syria.\nThe Turkish side will pause Operation Peace Spring in order to allow for the withdrawal of YPG forces from the safe zone for 120 hours.\u00a0 All military operations under Operation Peace Spring will be paused, and Operation Peace Spring will be halted entirely on completion of the withdrawal.\nOur administration has already been in contact with Syrian Defence Forces, and we have already begun to facilitate their safe withdrawal from the nearly 20-mile-wide safe zone area, south of the Turkish border in Syria.\nLet me say this also includes an agreement by Turkey to engage in no military action against the community of Kobani.\nAnd in addition, the United States and Turkey have both mutually committed to a peaceful resolution and future for the safe zone, working on an international basis to ensure that peace and security defines this border region of Syria.\nIn addition to the settlement today with the ceasefire, Turkey and the United States mutually committed to the Defeat ISIS activities in northeast Syria.\u00a0 This will also include an agreement renewed today to coordinate efforts on detention facilities and internally displaced persons in formerly ISIS- controlled areas.\nAlso, Turkey and the United States agree on the priority of respecting vulnerable human life, human rights, and particularly the protection of religious and ethnic communities in the region.\nI spoke to President Trump just a few moments ago, and I know the President is very grateful for President Erdo\u011fan\u2019s willingness to step forward and to enact the ceasefire, and to give an opportunity for a peaceful solution of this conflict that commenced one week ago.\nFor my part, I\u2019m grateful for the President\u2019s leadership.\u00a0 I\u2019m grateful for the more than five hours of negotiations with President Erdo\u011fan and his team that arrived at a solution that we believe will save lives.\nAnd let me also say I\u2019m very grateful for this team.\u00a0 To be able to have, alongside the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo; our National Security Advisor, Robert O\u2019Brien; Ambassador Jim \u2013Jim Jeffrey; and Ambassador David Satterfield was a great privilege.\u00a0 And each of the members of this team contributed equally to achieving this outcome, which is a great contribution to security in this region, and it\u2019s a great contribution to the strong and enduring relationship between the United States of America and Turkey.\nLastly, I want to express my appreciation to millions of Americans who I know were carrying this moment in prayer.\u00a0 We heard from people all over the country whose hearts were heavy with the loss of life in this conflict over the last week \u2014 longed to see it brought to an end.\u00a0 And I believe their prayers, the strong leadership that President Trump provided to this moment, and the cooperation with President Erdo\u011fan and Turkey has made this possible.\nAnd so again, let me say: A week after Turkish forces crossed into Syria, Turkey and the United States of America have agreed to a ceasefire in Syria.\u00a0 It will be a pause in military operations for 120 hours, while the United States facilitates the withdrawal of YPG from the affected areas in the safe zone.\u00a0 And once that is completed, Turkey has agreed to a permanent ceasefire.\u00a0 And the United States of America will work with Turkey, will work with nations around the world, to ensure that peace and stability is the order of the day in this safe zone on the border between Syria and Turkey.\nWith that, let me recognize Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\u00a0 And thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your great work.\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 I think the Vice President said it well.\u00a0 I just wanted to add to this thought: There obviously remains a great deal of work to do in the region.\u00a0 There\u2019s lots of challenges that remain.\u00a0 But this effort tonight sets the conditions for the successful resolution of this particular piece, which created enormous risk and a real risk of instability.\u00a0 And President Erdo\u011fan\u2019s decision tonight to work alongside President Trump to achieve this end will be one that I think will benefit Turkey a great deal.\u00a0 Thanks.\nI know you want to take some questions.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 Humeyra.\u00a0 Where are you?\u00a0 Go right ahead.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 What do you \u2014 how do you overcome \u2014 how will you overcome the damage that\u2019s been caused over the past week?\u00a0 There has been a lot of animosity between U.S. and Turkey.\u00a0 A lot of things have been said and a lot of threats of economic sanctions have been made.\u00a0 How are you going to repair the relationship going forward?\u00a0 Thank you.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, first, as you\u2019ll see from the agreement, part of our understanding is that, with the implementation of the ceasefire, the United States will not impose any further sanctions on Turkey.\u00a0 And once a permanent ceasefire is in effect, the President has agreed to withdraw the economic sanctions that were imposed this last Monday.\nBut make no mistake about it: President Trump was very clear with our ally, Turkey, about American opposition to Turkish military forces entering Syria.\u00a0 The President made that clear in his discussions, in his correspondence with President Erdo\u011fan.\u00a0 And I believe that the candor and frankness that President Trump applied to this and the strength of his relationship with President Erdo\u011fan both contributed to the ability for this agreement to come about.\nAnd now, we will \u2014 we will work together to implement this agreement.\u00a0 As I said, our team is already working with YPG personnel in the safe zone for an orderly withdrawal outside the 20-mile mark.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to go forward together to bring peace and security this region.\u00a0 I\u2019m very confident of that.\nOkay, I \u2014 Gonca Senay.\u00a0 Gonca.\u00a0 Please.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Gonca Senay from TRT World.\u00a0 There are reports by some international organizations on how YPG is treating ethnic and religious minorities in northern Syria, and Christian leaders in Turkey are making calls to the country to ensure peace and security in the region.\u00a0 I\u2019m wondering your thoughts on this.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, let me \u2014 let the Secretary also address that.\u00a0 But I can tell you that President Erdo\u011fan and I spoke at great length about the importance of protecting religious minorities in the region.\nPresident Erdo\u011fan also shared with me the perspective of many leaders in religious communities here in Turkey, who had great concerns about violence and persecution taking place along the border.\nAnd so, part of our agreement is to continue to work very closely to ensure that religious minorities can thrive and that religious pluralism is \u2014 is one of the characteristics of this \u2014 of this safe zone for some time to come.\u00a0 Mr. Secretary?\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\u00a0 I\u2019d add only this: We\u2019ve certainly heard from \u2014 the Vice President heard from Christian leaders around the world who expressed much of the same concern that you just described.\nWe think this reduction in violence, this ceasefire, reduces the risk of that.\u00a0 So we think this greatly contributes to protecting religious minorities throughout \u2014 throughout Syria and throughout the broader Middle East as well.\u00a0 This all obviously happens in the context of lots of religious challenges, lots of challenges of religious persecution in Iraq and other places as well.\u00a0 We think this is an important contribution in that regard.\nThe other thing is \u2014 that we talked about at some length \u2014 is that, to the extent there are abuses that are identified, we\u2019ll ask each leader \u2014 certainly President Erdo\u011fan and his team and others \u2014 to investigate any allegations of abuse that have taken place.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And let me maybe add an addendum to that.\u00a0 One of the things I know the President and the American people are most proud of is the investment of hundreds of millions of dollars to help rebuild Christian, Yazidi, and other religious minority communities in the aftermath of the horrifying violence during the \u2014 during the ISIS period, both in Syria and in northern Iraq.\nWe\u2019ll continue to flow those resources to support those communities. But as you\u2019ll see from this agreement, it is a specific undertaking by Turkey and by the United States to ensure \u2014 to protect religious minorities in the affected region.\nShaun Tandon.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\u00a0 You mentioned that there\u2019s an organized withdrawal of the YPG fighters.\u00a0 Could you explain that a little bit more?\u00a0 You said there\u2019s been an agreement with them.\u00a0 Where are they going to withdraw to?\u00a0 What do you see of the future of them?\nAnd while there are obviously concerns here in Turkey about the YPG and their links to PKK, many in Washington say, for example, that they lead part of the fight against the Islamic State group, against ISIS.\u00a0 What do you see for the future of northern Syria?\u00a0 Do you see any future for the Syrian Kurds, politically, there?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, our commitment with Turkey is that we will work with YPG members and \u2014 we also know as Syria Defense Forces \u2014 to facilitate an orderly withdrawal over the next 120 hours.\u00a0 Let me say that\u2019s literally already begun.\u00a0 And where they will be withdrawing from is the demarcation line, roughly 20 miles south of the border.\nTurkey\u2019s willingness to pause and to embrace a ceasefire of military operations, to enable us to \u2014 to see to that orderly withdrawal of YPG will, we believe, make it possible for that to occur.\u00a0 And it \u2014 I know it\u2019s already \u2014 already underway, as we speak.\nBut, look, Turkey has had a great concern about their border.\u00a0 And while the United States of America did not approve of their military crossing into Syria, we have always endorsed a safe zone.\u00a0 And it was a matter of discussion and negotiations.\nAnd we believe that \u2014 that the Kurdish population in Syria, with which we have a strong relationship, will continue to endure.\u00a0 The United States will always be grateful for our partnership with SDF in defeating ISIS, but we recognize the importance and the value of a safe zone to create a buffer between Syria proper and the Kurdish population and \u2014 and the Turkish border.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to be working very closely.\nSo we \u2014 we think the agreement today first ends the violence, which is what President Trump sent us here to do.\u00a0 I said it again and again to President Erdo\u011fan \u2014 is President Trump sent us here to end the violence and to achieve an immediate ceasefire.\u00a0 And thanks to the agreement that we negotiated today and the strong stand that President Trump took in the preceding days, we \u2014 we\u2019ve achieved that.\nWe\u2019ve also achieved an opportunity, by working with YPG, to move out of the area to create more peace and security and stability in that buffer zone.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to be working very earnestly to accomplish that.\u00a0 We believe that can be accomplished during the 120-hour period, and after which, there\u2019ll be a permanent ceasefire, and then we\u2019ll continue to engage.\nAgain, not militarily. \u00a0The President made it clear that we\u2019re not going to have military personnel on the ground.\u00a0 But the United States will continue to engage diplomatically, politically, and, of course, in humanitarian aid and support to affect all of the people affected in this region.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Go ahead there, Zeke.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\u00a0 You mentioned that \u2014 excuse me.\u00a0 You mentioned that the United States opposed to Turkey\u2019s incursion into northern Syria \u2014 that Erdo\u011fan had always wanted a sort of safe zone here.\u00a0 What concessions did you actually get out of President Erdo\u011fan, number one?\nNumber two: Have you gotten specific assurances from the YPG that they will comply with the terms of this agreement? Because this is something that they have said that they would not do.\nAnd finally, with the Kurds moving south and now with sort of \u2014 with the U.S. sanction, in terms of them moving south, what \u2014 how would you address critics who would call this potentially a second abandonment of the Kurds?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I think you\u2019ll be able to see from the agreement itself what concessions were made.\u00a0 President Trump, in his telephone call with President Erdo\u011fan earlier this week and in the directive that he gave us to deliver, was very clear that he \u2014 he wanted a ceasefire.\u00a0 He wanted to stop the violence.\nTurkey is engaged in an active military operation.\u00a0 I can tell you that, as our discussions began, over the course of the five-hour period of time, we \u2014 we reached a place of agreement about how a ceasefire could benefit Turkey, achieve President Trump\u2019s objectives, and also contribute to a peaceful resolution of the safe zone.\u00a0 And I believe that \u2014 I believe that we\u2019ve accomplished that.\nWith regard to the YPG, the Syrian Defence Forces, we have been in contact today and we have received repeated assurances from them that they\u2019ll be moving out, that they greatly welcome the opportunity for a ceasefire to make a safe and orderly withdrawal from those areas in the safe zone where they still have a presence.\u00a0 And we\u2019re very confident that that\u2019s already taking place.\nAnd we\u2019re going to be using all the leverage that we have, of having fought alongside the Syrian Defense Forces in the battle against ISIS to facilitate their safe withdrawal. But we think we \u2014 we think this is an outcome that will greatly serve the interests of \u2014 of the Kurdish population in Syria, it\u2019ll greatly serve the interests of Turkey, and it\u2019ll create the kind of long-term buffer zone that will ensure peace and stability in the region.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. Vice President \u2014\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Go right ahead.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I just want to follow up on that question.\u00a0 What specific concessions did Turkey receive?\u00a0 Specifically, I want to ask you if they brought the issue of the bank \u2014 Halbank \u2014 Halkbank, rather.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Not in the context of these negotiations.\u00a0 I think when we had concluded the negotiations, I know the topic was raised.\u00a0 And we informed them that that was a matter for the Southern District of New York and the Justice Department.\nBut let me say the \u2014 the concessions that the United States made have to do with the fact that the President had made it clear that if there had not been a ceasefire today, there would have been a new round of massive sanctions against Turkey.\u00a0 And you\u2019ll see in the agreement that \u2014 on the basis of the pause of 120 hours; a ceasefire over the next five days \u2014 that we will not be implementing additional sanctions during that period of time.\nOnce we have a permanent ceasefire, following the orderly withdrawal of all YPG forces, the United States also agreed to withdraw the sanctions that were imposed on several Cabinet officials and several agencies earlier this week.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To be clear though, just to nail this down: So, it was simply the sanctions that would be removed?\u00a0 Nothing else was offered or given to the Turks?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Right.\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\u00a0 That\u2019s correct.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s \u2014\nYeah.\u00a0 Go ahead.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\u00a0 While you were here negotiating with the Turks for several hours, both of you \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Cross-talk.)\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can I finish real quick?\u00a0 Wait.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you think the YPG \u2014 do you think the sanctions is a blackmail against your NATO Ally for the sake of PKK, YPG terrorist organizations?\u00a0 This is a (inaudible).\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 The United States of America did not support Turkey\u2019s military action in Syria.\u00a0 President Trump made that very clear to his friend, President Erdo\u011fan.\u00a0 And the United States imposed sanctions earlier this week.\u00a0 And the President made it clear yesterday, and we made it clear again today, that there would be additional sanctions coming to bring an end to the violence, to the loss of innocent lives in this border conflict.\nThat being said, let me say: I really believe today \u2014 today\u2019s ceasefire is a credit to President Trump and to President Erdo\u011fan.\u00a0 It\u2019s a credit to the strong relationship between the United States and Turkey.\u00a0 It\u2019s also a credit to the strong relationship between our two leaders.\nI mean, where there are differences between friends, it\u2019s important that the friends let their feelings be known. President Trump did that, in this case.\u00a0 But it facilitated us being able to reach an agreement that has now resulted in a ceasefire and, we believe, will set the stage for creating a peaceful and stable safe zone in the United States.\u00a0 He\u2019s committed to achieving that for all the people of this region.\nThank you all.\nEND\n8:58 P.M.

to Frank Capra; from Joe DiMaggio \u2014 he was a great player, great player; to Vince Lombardi \u2014 what a coach; and from Mother Cabrini, to the late, great Justice Antonin Scalia, the father of Gene.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Soon he\u2019ll be known as \u201cthe father of Gene.\u201d\u00a0 Right, Gene?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 He was a great man and a great guy.\nCountless Italian-Americans have answered the call to defend our nation in uniform, serving in every war and every branch of our armed forces.\nAmong those we\u2019re honored to have with us tonight, the first Marine to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a proud Italian American: General Peter Pace.\u00a0 Peter?\u00a0 Where are you, Peter?\u00a0 Peter?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 That\u2019s fantastic.\u00a0 The Chairman \u2014 that\u2019s a big position, Peter, right?\u00a0 That\u2019s a great position.\u00a0 We have a great new Chairman, now, as you know.\u00a0 I want to thank you, Peter, for being here and heroism on the battlefield, your lifetime of service to our nation.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nThis evening, we\u2019re also thrilled to be joined by another very special guest \u2014 an Italian-American legend who truly knows about winning and he knows about speed.\u00a0 I had the privilege of being driven by him one day along \u2014 we were doing a show along Central Park West.\u00a0 He took off in a car \u2014 four blocks.\u00a0 We covered the blocks in about one second.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cGet me \u2014 get me out of here.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And you\u2019ll see what I\u2019m talking about.\u00a0 But it was a seriously fast and I\u2019m very happy to be with you tonight.\nHis family immigrated to the United States in 1955 with just $125 dollars to their name.\u00a0 As a boy, he dreamed to be like his heroes in Formula One racing.\u00a0 And sure enough, he grew up to be one of the fastest men alive, one of the greatest racers of all time.\u00a0 He is the only driver in world history to win the Indy 500, the Daytona 500, and the Formula One World Championship. Not bad.\u00a0 I guess he likes speed.\u00a0 He has 111 career wins in races all across the globe, which has to be a record of some kind.\u00a0 That\u2019s a lot of wins.\u00a0 That\u2019s a lot of non-choking.\u00a0 There\u2019s no choke when you win that much.\u00a0 A lot of people choke.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t choke.\nHe is a legendary racecar driver, and somebody that\u2019s very special in the annals of sport, Mario Andretti.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Mario, wherever you are, come on up.\u00a0 Come up, Mario.\u00a0 Come up, Mario.\u00a0 There he is.\u00a0 Boy, you look good, Mario.\nYou remember you took me on that ride?\u00a0 I said, \u201cGet me out of here.\u201d\u00a0 He said \u2014 we were together.\u00a0 I said, \u201cMario, get me out of here.\u00a0 I want to get out of this car.\u201d\u00a0 We went so fast.\u00a0 We literally \u2014 we covered four blocks in like a second.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And he said, \u201cSir, that\u2019s actually going very slow.\u201d\u00a0 He wanted to go faster.\u00a0 I said, \u201cWe did it enough.\u201d\u00a0 That was for \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d\u00a0 We had fun.\nSay a few words to your friends, please.\u00a0 Thank you, Mario.\nMR. ANDRETTI:\u00a0 I\u2019m also not very tall, as you can see.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Well, thank you so much.\u00a0 And as you said, I\u2019m an Italian immigrant.\u00a0 I\u2019m very, very \u2014 as you can imagine \u2014 proud of my heritage.\u00a0 But I also found we, as a family \u2014 we found our home here in America.\u00a0 And I\u2019m the true, true, I think, example of what the American Dream is about.\nAnd I always said, because of that, with pride and gratitude, I salute the Stars and Stripes.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 That\u2019s great, Mario.\nMR. ANDRETTI:\u00a0 Yes, indeed.\u00a0 And, again, I can only thank you and thank you for having me up here.\u00a0 And I know that you made the show, right?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\nMR. ANDRETTI:\u00a0 And we made it so \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Absolutely.\nMR. ANDRETTI:\u00a0 \u2014 so that was mission accomplished.\u00a0 And I appreciate that fact.\u00a0 So thank you very much, Mr. President.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Do you remember that day?\nMR. ANDRETTI:\u00a0 Yeah, I remember.\u00a0 Yes, I \u2014 actually it\u2019s on YouTube.\u00a0 I showed it to some of our friends back here.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Yeah.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure I want to watch.\nMR. ANDRETTI:\u00a0 I didn\u2019t mess up your hair either.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 No, he didn\u2019t.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, Mario.\nMR. ANDRETTI:\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 One hundred and eleven wins \u2014 think about that \u2014 for speed.\u00a0 And that has to be in your blood, Mario, right?\nLet him say hello to the President.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I think they like each other.\nHey, Mario, so when you have 111 wins, that\u2019s in your blood, right?\u00a0 It\u2019s got to be in the blood.\u00a0 Can you do that if you don\u2019t like going fast, huh?\u00a0 Yeah, you get \u2014 you get a driver, that\u2019s the way you do it, right?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nAnyway, thank you very much.\u00a0 Stay up here if you\u2019d like, Mario.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nTo all Italian-Americans in the room and across our country: Again, thank you for uplifting our communities, thank you for strengthening our nation, and thank you for everything you\u2019ve done to unleash American greatness.\u00a0 You\u2019re an amazing group of people.\u00a0 I know so many people in the room tonight.\u00a0 We have so many successful people, great people.\nAs many of you know, our guest of honor tonight, President Sergio Mattarella, entered politics to combat the mafia \u2014 that means he\u2019s tough; that\u2019s a tough deal \u2014 and spent much of his career rooting out corruption.\u00a0 He is a crime-fighter and a patriot \u2014 two things we love in America.\u00a0 He\u2019s also the first Sicilian President of the Italian Republic.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMr. President, we are delighted to have you both with us at the White House.\u00a0 And I really have a lot of respect for you.\u00a0 We spent the day together.\u00a0 It was a wild day.\u00a0 He said, \u201cYou know, your news conferences are tougher than most.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2014 every question is a kill.\u00a0 They go in for the kill \u2014 the fake news back there.\u00a0 Every question is a kill.\u00a0 But he got it.\u00a0 He\u2019s a pro.\u00a0 He\u2019s really amazing.\u00a0 He\u2019s an amazing guy.\nAnd I\u2019d like to invite you up, Mr. President, to say a few words.\u00a0 Please.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nPRESIDENT MATTARELLA:\u00a0 (As interpreted.)\u00a0 Mr. President, I am very grateful for your words of friendship \u2014 words that I wish to reciprocate.\u00a0 Also, on behalf of my daughter and of my accompanying delegation, thank you also very much for your very, very warm welcome here in Washington, D.C.\nAnd I also listened with a great deal of pleasure to the words you have spoke a few minutes ago, mentioning all of the bonds we share and all the great people that are of Italian heritage.\nAnd I am happy to be able to greet representatives of the U.S. institutions and civil society, along with representatives of the American community of Italian descent, all of whom are citizens who, through their labor, their dignity, and their sacrifice, have contributed to the progress of this great nation and to its identity, thereby honoring the motto, \u201cE Pluribus Unum,\u201d which has been accompanying the country for over two centuries.\nMore and more people, including many youngsters, now consider the United States and Italy as a home which they can live in and move back and forth in, and therefore supporting our countries with passion and determination as they head towards the future.\nAnd by doing so, our deep friendship is strengthened.\u00a0 It is a friendship fostered by the Trans-Atlantic Alliance, and it was fostered very much after World War Two.\u00a0 The United States contribution to the liberation of Europe from Nazi fascism is priceless, and Italy and Europe\u2019s gratitude towards your American people is everlasting.\u00a0 We are part of a community of values and principles.\nThe United States of America\u2019s responsible leadership in the free world, also thanks to the impulse it gave to the creation of the United Nations, has had Italy\u2019s full support in striving towards peace and international security, as recently happened in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Balkans, the Horn of Africa, and the Sahel, within the framework of the Coalition to Defeat Daesh and Transnational Terrorism.\u00a0 And, together, as loyal allies, Washington and Rome have faced the challenges of an ever-changing global context.\nMr. President, peace and development in Europe have been guaranteed by the integration of countries which used to be opponents.\u00a0 The United States were a key player in calling for intense cooperation between European countries after World War Two, and we still acknowledge the importance of that choice in striking a global balance in which freedom and the rights of mankind are respected.\nTo us, the European Union \u2014 besides being a driver for growth and prosperity, much like the Atlantic Alliance, is a community we were destined for \u2014 one founded on the values and rights we share with the United States.\nTo our countries, Mr. President, the Trans-Atlantic bond resonates in our common foreign and defense policies, and in our close social relations, our cultural cooperation, our traditional economic cooperation, and trade \u2014 which we hope will develop with the broadest and fairest freedom of trade and growth and investments.\nOur bond embraces research and involves scholars, universities, businesses, and professionals from both our countries.\u00a0 It\u2019s something we\u2019re witnessing in the fascinating quest to increase our knowledge regarding space \u2014 a journey which was started when the U.S., and mankind with it, allowed the first human being to step onto the moon\u2019s soil.\nAnd I wish to celebrate that feat by sending my thoughts to the astronauts, including Nick Hague, Andrew Morgan, Christina Koch, and our own Luca Parmitano, who are currently working on the International Space Station.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMr. President, these women and men orbiting the Earth speak to us of hope, and they speak to us of the future of mankind.\u00a0 They represent the progress shared by the U.S., Europe, and Italy.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThank you very much.\u00a0 And, Mrs. Scalia, thank you very much.\u00a0 A special woman.\u00a0 I just spotted you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEND\n7:19 P.M.

EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great honor to have the President of Italy with us.\u00a0 He is a man of great distinction.\u00a0 He\u2019s highly respected in this country.\u00a0 And it\u2019s nice to have you at the White House.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr. President.\nWe\u2019ve had a great relationship with Italy for a long time.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been closer than it is now.\u00a0 We have won a $7.5 billion award from, as you know \u2014 I guess it\u2019s been pretty big news.\u00a0 And I know that this is against the European Union and World Trade \u2014 good ole World Trade.\u00a0 For a long time, they\u2019ve been taking advantage of the United States.\u00a0 And I know Turkey is going to talk to us about their share of it because they feel they shouldn\u2019t have to pay so much.\nAnd if you look at what\u2019s going on, Italy is complaining about it.\u00a0 Turkey is com- \u2014 everybody is complaining about it.\u00a0 Turkey is complaining about a lot of things, and we\u2019re handling Turkey very nicely.\u00a0 But we have many countries complaining about the different awards that we\u2019ve been winning lately from the courts.\u00a0 And the reason we\u2019re winning is we\u2019re properly represented.\nWe\u2019re winning, in the case of the European Union, $7.5 billion.\u00a0 And Italy has a percentage of that to pay.\u00a0 And, in the \u2014 in other cases, we\u2019ve won.\u00a0 And we have a lot of money coming into the United States for the first time ever.\u00a0 Tremendous amounts of money in many different forms, including tariffs.\nOur farmers now have been taken care of well.\u00a0 China has already started their purchases.\u00a0 There was some misreporting, which does not \u2014 frankly, I\u2019m not at all surprised \u2014 but there\u2019s been some misreporting that China will start purchasing when the deal is signed.\nThe deal is being papered right now.\u00a0 Bob Lighthizer is with us.\u00a0 Mike Pompeo is with us.\u00a0 And they\u2019re going to be joining us for the discussion.\nBut there have been some reports that China is not buying until the deal is signed.\u00a0 No, China has started buying already from the farmers.\u00a0 It\u2019ll be anywhere from $40 [billion] to $50 billion, which is far more than anybody thought or expected.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great deal for the farmers.\u00a0 I think the farmers will come out \u2014 along with many other industries in the United States \u2014 will come out as one of the big beneficiaries of the trade deal with China.\nBut they have already started purchasing; in fact, they started purchasing three weeks ago.\u00a0 You can see the numbers for yourself.\u00a0 It\u2019s great for our country.\u00a0 It\u2019s great for \u2014 I think it\u2019s great for China, too.\u00a0 But it\u2019s something that\u2019s already taken effect, even though the deal won\u2019t be signed probably until I meet with President Xi in Chile, where we have a summit.\u00a0 So that\u2019ll be good.\nBut the World Trade \u2014 as you know, we won $7.5 billion, and that is being distributed among various countries in the European Union.\u00a0 Italy is one of those countries.\u00a0 And I know that the President of Italy wants to discuss that, and it\u2019s one of the discussions.\nAnd the other thing, of course, is trade and numerous elements of the military, and terrorism, and security.\u00a0 So, we\u2019ll be discussing everything.\nPlease.\n(Interpreter provides translation.)\nAnd I\u2019m pleased to report that in Syria, Turkey \u2014 the border \u2014 we only had 28 soldiers, not 50.\u00a0 We thought it was 50.\u00a0 Somebody reported 50.\u00a0 It was actually down to 28.\u00a0 They were removed a while ago.\u00a0 All American soldiers are away from the site.\nSyria and Turkey may fight.\u00a0 Syria is friendly with the Kurds.\u00a0 The Kurds are very well protected; plus, they know how to fight.\u00a0 And, by the way, they\u2019re no angels, but they were with us.\u00a0 They are no angels.\u00a0 But they are fighting.\u00a0 We are largely out of that area.\u00a0 We\u2019re very well set.\u00a0 We have quite a contingent, right nearby, of soldiers and of the finest equipment in the world.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have to use it.\nSo, Syria is either negotiating with or talking to Turkey.\u00a0 We\u2019re also talking to Turkey.\u00a0 We\u2019ve put massive sanctions on Turkey.\u00a0 Sanctions work, frankly, better than fighting.\u00a0 Certainly when you\u2019re down to 28 people, we\u2019re not going to be fighting.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t want to fight anyway.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to, from the United States\u2019 standpoint.\nNow, as to Syria wanting to take back their land, that\u2019s a whole different story.\u00a0 If Syria wants to fight for their land, that\u2019s up to Turkey and Syria, as it has been for hundreds of years, they\u2019ve been fighting.\u00a0 And the Kurds have been fighting for hundreds of years \u2014 that whole mess.\u00a0 It\u2019s been going along for a long time.\nSyria may have some help with Russia, and that\u2019s fine.\u00a0 It\u2019s a lot of sand.\u00a0 They\u2019ve got a lot of sand over there.\u00a0 So there\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\nBut we were supposed to be there for 30 days; we stayed for 10 years.\u00a0 And it\u2019s time for us to come home.\u00a0 We\u2019re not a policing agent, and it\u2019s time for us to come home.\nBut we\u2019re working with Turkey.\u00a0 We\u2019re working with talking to everybody in the area \u2014 whatever we can to do keep it stable or stabilize it as much as possible, knowing that it\u2019s possibly never going to be very stable.\nAnd we are \u2014 I think we\u2019re in a very good position in the Middle East.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re very, very strong in the Middle East.\u00a0 Iran is going to hell; their economy is in deep trouble.\u00a0 Their GDP went down 20 percent, which nobody ever even heard of before.\u00a0 Probably 25 percent.\nWe\u2019ll be talking to Iran also.\u00a0 They want very much to talk.\u00a0 The sanctions with Iran \u2014 all of the things that we\u2019ve done, including some tariffs and different things having to do with countries that are dealing with them that we put on \u2014 all of the economic sanctions are working very well.\nSo, Iran will be an interesting case, but we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 They want to talk.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see whether or not they talk.\u00a0 If they talk, good.\u00a0 And if they don\u2019t talk, that\u2019s okay, too.\u00a0 But I think we\u2019re doing a very good job in the sense of, strategically, we have Syria talking about their land.\u00a0 It\u2019s not our land.\u00a0 Turkey has gone on to Syria.\u00a0 And, if Turkey goes into Syria, that\u2019s between Turkey and Syria; it\u2019s not between Turkey and the United States, like a lot of stupid people would like us to \u2014 would like you to believe.\nAnd I watched, last night \u2014 a couple of people understood.\u00a0 Actually, a couple of the Democrats \u2014 I won\u2019t say which ones \u2014 but a couple of the more competent Democrats actually understood what I was doing and what the plan is.\nBut, really, the plan is to get out of endless wars, to bring our soldiers back home, to not be policing agents all over the world.\u00a0 If you look at other countries \u2014 Russia, China \u2014 they don\u2019t have countries to take care of.\u00a0 We have \u2014 we\u2019re close to 90 countries, in one form or another.\u00a0 We\u2019re in 90 countries all over the world, policing and \u2014 frankly, many of those countries, they don\u2019t respect what we\u2019re doing, they don\u2019t even like what we\u2019re doing, and they don\u2019t like us.\nSo, we\u2019re looking all over the world.\u00a0 There\u2019s tremendous amounts of money, manpower, lives that we save by doing it much differently.\u00a0 If people aren\u2019t respecting what we\u2019re going to be doing, that\u2019s too bad.\nYou read where we\u2019re sending some troops to Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 That\u2019s true.\u00a0 Because we want to help Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 They have been a very good ally.\u00a0 They\u2019ve agreed to pay for the cost of those troops.\u00a0 They\u2019ve agreed to pay fully for the cost of everything we\u2019re doing over there. \u00a0That\u2019s something you have never heard before, I think, as long as you\u2019ve been standing out there.\u00a0 I think you \u2014 the media has never heard that before.\nBut Saudi Arabia has graciously agreed to pay for the full cost of everything we\u2019re doing for them.\u00a0 We\u2019re sending some tremendous missiles over.\u00a0 We\u2019re sending some great power over to Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 Saudi Arabia is paying for 100 percent of the cost, including the cost of our soldiers.\u00a0 And that negotiation took a very short time \u2014 like, maybe, about 35 seconds.\nAnd I would like now to introduce the President of Italy to say a few words.\u00a0 And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to have many questions for him.\nThank you.\nPRESIDENT MATTARELLA:\u00a0 (As interpreted.)\u00a0 Well, Mr. President, thank you very much for your kind invitation and for a very warm welcome to the White House.\u00a0 Thank you for the very interesting remarks you just made.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure we will be discussing all of these issues during our talks later on in a full spirit of loyalty and cooperation, which is what friends and allies have to do.\nItaly and the U.S. share a set of values, a set of cultures.\u00a0 Our bond is fostered by our human relations.\u00a0 And I\u2019m very pleased to be here in this moment in time as we celebrate the Italian-American Heritage Month.\nAnd again, I\u2019m very happy to be here to meet with you, Mr. President.\u00a0 It\u2019s a pleasure to see you again after we met at the G20 Summit in Taormina, Sicily.\u00a0 Our meeting, again, is proof of the friendship between our countries, as also testified by our common belonging to the Atlantic Alliance and, of course, by the human bonds that our countries share and by the long friendship and alliance that we have.\nAnd as you may remember, Mr. President, when we met in the summit in Taormina, the weather was wonderful.\u00a0 It was also beautiful here yesterday, as well.\u00a0 And, of course, the fact that we can meet in different places around the world testifies to how solid our bonds are.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I think the bonds between Italy and the United States have never been more solid.\u00a0 I have so many Italian friends.\u00a0 I can\u2019t tell you how many Italian friends.\u00a0 And we have a lot also in your government.\u00a0 We have a lot of great friends in your government.\nI think the WTO award has been testament to a lot of good work by the Trump administration.\u00a0 We never won with the WTO, or essentially never won.\u00a0 Very seldom did we win.\u00a0 And now we\u2019re winning a lot.\u00a0 We\u2019re winning a lot because they know if we\u2019re not treated fairly, we\u2019re leaving.\u00a0 Because we were a piggybank that every other country was robbing.\u00a0 And China became rich because of the WTO.\u00a0 That\u2019s when China really ascended.\u00a0 That\u2019s when China went up.\u00a0 That\u2019s when they made their great rise.\u00a0 They were flat lining, and then, all of a sudden, around the year 2000, 2001, when they got involved with the WTO, it became a whole different story.\nAnd China was taking $500 billion a year out of the United States, plus intellectual property theft and many other things.\u00a0 And it was \u2014 I give China a lot of credit.\u00a0 I give the people that ran our country no credit.\u00a0 I give them discredit for what they allowed to happen.\nBut the WTO \u2014 that\u2019s the World Trade Organization \u2014 has been very unfair to the United States.\u00a0 They know I feel that way, and I think since they know I feel that way, all of a sudden, we\u2019re starting to win very big awards.\nThe $7.5 billion that we won is going to be discussed.\u00a0 The percentage \u2014 a percentage of that is to be paid by Italy.\u00a0 And Italy thinks that we\u2019re charging them too much, and we will certainly take that under consideration.\u00a0 And we will discuss that today.\nWe\u2019re also discussing some very big trade deals.\u00a0 Actually, Italy is a very major trade partner with us.\u00a0 We do a lot of trade together.\u00a0 And they make incredible product.\u00a0 We buy and they buy.\u00a0 And we have a very good relationship \u2014 sometimes stymied by the European Union, which is, frankly, very tough to deal with and very tough negotiators, very unfair negotiators.\u00a0 They know I feel that way.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll see what happens, ultimately, with the European Union.\u00a0 But they have been very unfair to the United States.\u00a0 Italy, on the other hand, they\u2019ve been a great partner.\nPlease.\n(Interpreter provides translation.)\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you okay \u2014 are you okay with Erdo\u011fan saying that he is not going to do a ceasefire?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 He didn\u2019t say that at all.\u00a0 He\u2019s meeting.\u00a0 And he\u2019s meeting today with some of our representatives.\u00a0 Mike Pence is leaving today, as you know.\u00a0 We needed to take an extra day for security reasons.\u00a0 But Mike is leaving.\u00a0 Mike Pompeo will be meeting also, who is here right now with us.\u00a0 And he is going to be joining the meeting. \u00a0We have a lot of great people over there.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see.\nIn the meantime, our soldiers are not in harm\u2019s way \u2014 as they shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 as two countries fight over land that has nothing to do with us.\nAnd the Kurds are much safer right now, but the Kurds know how to fight.\u00a0 And, as I said, they\u2019re not angels.\u00a0 They\u2019re not angels, if you take a look.\u00a0 You have to go back and take a look.\u00a0 But they fought with us.\u00a0 We paid a lot of money for them to fight with us, and that\u2019s okay.\u00a0 They did well when they fought with us; they didn\u2019t do so well when they didn\u2019t fight with us.\nWhen I refused to allow the Americans, a year and a half ago, to fight with the Kurds against Iraq, I said, \u201cWait a minute, this country, stupidly, just spent a fortune on fighting for, with, around Iraq.\u201d\u00a0 Nobody knows how they spent it.\u00a0 But they spent \u2014 actually, we\u2019re in the Middle East now for $8 trillion, if you can believe that stupidity.\u00a0 But, in Iraq, we\u2019re in for probably $5.5 trillion.\u00a0 So they\u2019re telling me, \u201cWait a minute, we just spent $5.5 trillion fighting in Iraq and with Iraq.\u00a0 And now we\u2019re supposed to spend money to fight with the Kurds against Iraq.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d\nSo what happens is, when I said we\u2019re not going to fight with the Kurds, the Kurds left.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t want to fight against Iraq, which right now isn\u2019t the greatest fighting force in the world.\u00a0 That happened twice.\u00a0 The Kurds, actually, are pulling back substantially from Turkey.\u00a0 And Syria is pulling in.\u00a0 Syria probably will have a partner of Russia \u2014 whoever they may have.\u00a0 I wish them all a lot of luck.\u00a0 You know, Russia was involved in Afghanistan.\u00a0 Used to be called the Soviet Union.\u00a0 Now it\u2019s called Russia for a reason, because they lost so much money in Afghanistan, that they had to downsize.\u00a0 A very big downsizing.\nSo, if Russia wants to get involved with the \u2014 with Syria, that\u2019s really up to them.\u00a0 They have a problem with Turkey, they have a problem at a border.\u00a0 It\u2019s not our border.\u00a0 We shouldn\u2019t be losing lives over it.\nBut again, we only had 28 soldiers.\u00a0 It was 26, 28.\u00a0 I got all different numbers.\u00a0 It ends up being 28 \u2014 between the 26, 28.\u00a0 Two people, and they\u2019re fully accounted for.\nSo, that\u2019s the story.\u00a0 It\u2019s very simple.\u00a0 And we\u2019re watching and we\u2019re negotiating, and we\u2019re trying to get Turkey to do the right thing, because we\u2019d like to stop wars regardless.\u00a0 Whether Americans are in or whether they\u2019re not in, we want to see wars stopped.\u00a0 That\u2019s a very important thing.\u00a0 On a humanitarian basis, we want to see that happen.\nSteve?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How confident are you that Mike Pence will be able to arrange a ceasefire?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Why don\u2019t you go and dictate?\nINTERPRETER:\u00a0 Yes.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yes, please.\nINTERPRETER:\u00a0 The answer was \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I\u2019ll let you go.\nINTERPRETER:\u00a0 \u2014 \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d\u00a0 Excuse me. (Laughs.)\nPRESIDENT MATTARELLA:\u00a0 (Speaks Italian.)\nINTERPRETER:\u00a0 (Continues translation in Italian.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 So I view the situation on the Turkish border with Syria to be, for the United States, strategically brilliant.\u00a0 Our soldiers are out of there.\u00a0 Our soldiers are totally safe.\u00a0 They\u2019ve got to work it out.\u00a0 Maybe they can do it without fighting.\u00a0 Syria is protecting the Kurds. \u00a0That\u2019s good.\nWe are \u2014 and, by the way, every player hates ISIS.\u00a0 Everybody we\u2019re talking about.\u00a0 Syria more than us.\u00a0 Russia more than us.\u00a0 They\u2019ve done a big number on Russia.\u00a0 And we\u2019re over there fighting ISIS, but they\u2019re over there fighting ISIS, too.\u00a0 They can handle it, and they should handle it.\u00a0 We can fight our own battles on our own territories.\nBut you have a lot of countries over there that hate ISIS as much as we do; in some cases, probably more.\u00a0 So they can take care of ISIS.\u00a0 We have them captured.\u00a0 The United States captured them.\u00a0 Some were released just for effect \u2014 to make us look a little bit like, \u201cOh, gee, we\u2019ve got to get right back in there.\u201d\u00a0 But you have a lot of countries over there that have power and that hate ISIS very much, as much as we do.\nSo I think we\u2019re in a very strategically good position.\u00a0 I know the fake news doesn\u2019t make it look that way, but we have \u2014 we\u2019ve removed all of our, as we said, 50 soldiers, but much less than 50 soldiers.\u00a0 They\u2019re now in a very \u2014 very safe location, heading into an even safer location.\nAnd we will help negotiate.\u00a0 We have tremendously powerful sanctions.\u00a0 Our country has become economically much more powerful than, frankly, it ever was.\u00a0 We\u2019ve picked up trillions and trillions of dollars in worth.\u00a0 The market was up big yesterday.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be up big today, it looks like.\u00a0 The trade deal with China, just having to do with what we\u2019ve done with the financial services, with banks, with the farmers, has been incredible \u2014 far greater than anyone ever thought.\nI agree, it hasn\u2019t been papered yet, but it\u2019s being papered.\u00a0 But, in the meantime, as you know and as we\u2019ve said many times, China has already started buying.\u00a0 They want to buy.\u00a0 They want to make a deal.\u00a0 They really have to make a deal.\u00a0 Their economy has been hurt very badly by what we\u2019ve done and by the tariffs that we\u2019ve charged.\nAnd we\u2019ve taken in tremendous amounts of tariffs.\u00a0 A small portion of them we\u2019ve given to the farmer, which \u2014 the farmers \u2014 which has more than made up for what they\u2019ve lost.\nGo ahead.\n(Interpreter provides translation.)\nAnd because of the newfound economic power of the United States, because of the fact that we\u2019ve made so many trillions \u2014 many, many trillions of dollars in worth of the United States \u2014 I call it the \u201cnewfound economic power\u201d\u00a0\u2014 if my opponent would\u2019ve won, China would right now be the most powerful nation, economically, in the world.\u00a0 And, right now, they\u2019re not even close.\u00a0 And if we\u2019re smart, they never will get close.\u00a0 But it depends on who sits in this chair.\nBut the United States has tremendous economic power.\u00a0 Far more power than playing around with having a few soldiers shooting each other at the border.\u00a0 I mean, you have a few soldiers back and forth, killing each other at the border.\u00a0 The power we have with sanctions and tariffs is far greater than what we\u2019re talking about.\nWith that being said, our military has been completely rebuilt.\u00a0 Much of the equipment has already been delivered.\u00a0 We spent two and a half trillion dollars rebuilding it over the last three years.\u00a0 And our military power is at the highest level, and our economic power is at the highest level.\u00a0 But I\u2019d always rather use economic power before I use military power, because people aren\u2019t getting killed with economic power.\u00a0 Okay?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, you\u2019re scheduled to see House Speaker Nancy Pelosi today.\u00a0 How do you expect that meeting to go?\nPRESIDENT MATTARELLA:\u00a0 (As interpreted.)\u00a0 Before the members of the press introduce topics that have already been discussed this morning, President Trump was talking about the possible implementation of tariffs on European products following the whole Airbus affair.\u00a0 Of course, that\u2019s a topic that we will certainly be discussing this morning, and I do hope that we can come up with a cooperative-based approach and a frank discussion, so we can avoid retaliation between the two parties.\nItaly and I \u2014 myself, personally \u2014 have always felt that it\u2019s better to talk things through to find a common solution, to find some sort of understanding for one another\u2019s stances.\u00a0 Because the alternative to that would be tariffs followed by retaliation, followed by further tariffs.\u00a0 And we also have to understand that we are waiting for a solution of the Boeing affair, as well.\nSo, of course, within the spirit of the Atlantic Alliance, within the spirit of the friendship we\u2019ve always had, I do feel it would be best to discuss these things and understand one another.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, in theory, there can\u2019t be retaliation because this was an award that we got because of the fact that the European Union took advantage of past Presidents, and this was an award that we got for the unfair treatment given to the United States by the European Union.\u00a0 So there should be no retaliation.\nThis was getting us even because $7.5 billion worth of things happened \u2014 bad things happened, unfair things happened \u2014 to the United States by the European Union.\u00a0 So this was just getting us back to even.\u00a0 And nobody else but me would\u2019ve gotten that $7.5 billion back for the taxpayers of the United States.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, I\u2019m sure you saw reports that John Bolton said that Rudy Giuliani was like a \u201chand grenade\u201d the way he was acting.\u00a0 And are you concerned that Bolton could be called to testify in your impeachment inquiry?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Look, John Bolton \u2014 I got along well with him.\u00a0 Some people didn\u2019t; some people didn\u2019t like John Bolton.\u00a0 I actually got along with him pretty well.\u00a0 It just didn\u2019t work out.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know that he got along with Rudy Giuliani.\nRudy Giuliani was seeking out corruption, and what happens mostly in the 2016 election, because there was tremendous corruption in the 2016 election.\u00a0 I think even you would admit that.\u00a0 The election was \u2014 it was disgraceful what happened, and what happened to me, and what happened to the Republicans.\u00a0 And that continues with Nancy Pelosi and with Schiff.\u00a0 Adam Schiff got caught making up statements that he said I said, that I didn\u2019t say \u2014 which is fraud.\u00a0 I mean, it\u2019s purely fraudulent.\u00a0 So it continues.\nSo, Rudy was a great prosecutor.\u00a0 He was the best mayor in the history of the city of New York, as far as I can see.\u00a0 I think he\u2019s pretty much acknowledged \u2014 what he did for crime and everything else.\u00a0 And when he saw what was going on with our election of 2016 \u2014 the election I won, but the election that was absolutely corrupted by things that took place in government.\u00a0 Now, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u00a0 The IG report is going to come out soon, and we\u2019ll see what happens.\nI think people \u2014 I know nothing about it, in terms of the report.\u00a0 I\u2019m waiting for the report like everybody else.\u00a0 But I predict you will see things that you don\u2019t even believe, the level of corruption \u2014 whether it\u2019s Comey; whether it\u2019s Strzok and his lover, Page; whether it\u2019s so many other people \u2014 McCabe; whether it\u2019s President Obama himself.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see whether or not it\u2019s President Obama.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see whether or not they put that in.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Wait a minute.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see whether or not.\nSo, Rudy saw that.\u00a0 And I can tell you, Rudy Giuliani \u2014 because was very, very incensed at the horrible things that he saw, as are many people, okay?\u00a0 And many Republicans.\u00a0 And the Republicans have been treated very unfairly by the Democrats.\u00a0 I\u2019ll say this: Paul Ryan would never issue a subpoena.\u00a0 I don\u2019t say right or wrong.\u00a0 He wouldn\u2019t do it.\u00a0 He had too much respect for our country.\u00a0 Nancy Pelosi hands them out like cookies.\u00a0 Everybody \u2014 I don\u2019t even know these people.\u00a0 And for the most part, people like that are test- \u2014 I don\u2019t even know who they are.\u00a0 I never even heard of some of them, most of them.\nBut I have all these people testifying.\u00a0 And then they leak out.\u00a0 They don\u2019t say the goods parts; they only say the bad parts.\u00a0 We\u2019re not allowed to representation.\u00a0 We\u2019re not allowed to lawyers.\u00a0 We\u2019re not allowed to have anything.\u00a0 The Democrats are treating the Republicans very, very badly.\u00a0 Fortunately, we have a lot of good, strong, smart Republicans.\u00a0 But they never dealt, Jon, with the Democrats the way the Democrats deal.\u00a0 And the Republicans won\u2019t forget it because what they\u2019re doing, what the Democrats are doing to this nation is a disgrace.\nWhat they have done \u2014 the disrespect that they\u2019ve shown to the presidency \u2014 and it\u2019ll happen to them.\u00a0 Because if the Republicans have the House, which I think they will \u2014 because of impeachment, I think \u2014 because of this nonsense impeachment.\u00a0 It\u2019s based on a perfect phone conversation \u2014 an absolutely perfect phone conversation with the President of Ukraine.\nA friend of mine, who\u2019s a top lawyer, read it.\u00a0 He said, \u201cThis is perfect.\u00a0 You didn\u2019t say\u2026\u201d\u00a0 Did you know this was going to happen?\u00a0 I actually thought it was going to happen.\u00a0 There were many people listening to that conversation, because when I speak to a leader \u2014 like, if I speak to the President of Italy, if I speak to anybody \u2014 I know that there are many intelligence people on the line.\u00a0 I know that, I mean, with my understanding and knowledge.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know exactly who, but I assume there are many people.\nFortunately, they had transcribers, stenographers \u2014 people that do this for a living \u2014 on the line because we have an exact copy of the report, of the call.\nSo the call was put out immediately when I started hearing about the whistleblower.\u00a0 Well, the whistleblower\u2019s report was totally wrong.\u00a0 The whistleblower didn\u2019t know what he was talking about, or was given false information, or it was even worse than that.\u00a0 Now, all of a sudden, Schiff doesn\u2019t want to talk to the whistleblower.\u00a0 Now, all of a sudden, quid pro quo doesn\u2019t matter because now they see, in the call, there was no quid pro quo.\nSo, with Rudy, Rudy was seeking out corruption.\u00a0 And I think there\u2019s nothing wrong seeking out corruption.\nDid you have \u2014 Steve?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But should Rudy have registered as a foreign lobbyist, though?\u00a0 That\u2019s the question here.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what he did.\u00a0 I \u2014 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 That\u2019s up to him.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He had clients and he was talking to you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 That, you have to ask \u2014 excuse me, no.\u00a0 You have to ask Rudy those questions.\u00a0 Don\u2019t ask me.\u00a0 But Rudy was one of many people that was incensed at the corruption that took place during that election.\u00a0 Pure corruption.\nFor instance, I still ask the FBI: Where is the server?\u00a0 How come the FBI never got the server from the DNC?\u00a0 Where is the server?\u00a0 I want to see the server.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see what\u2019s on the server.\u00a0 So, the server, they say, is held by a company whose primary ownership individual is from Ukraine.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to see the server.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s very important for this country to see the server.\u00a0 Nobody wants to see it.\u00a0 The media never wants to see it.\u00a0 But I\u2019ll tell you, Republicans want to see it.\nSo, Republicans aren\u2019t treated well.\u00a0 And here\u2019s the problem: I think we\u2019re going to take the House, based on what\u2019s happening with the impeachment stuff.\u00a0 And the Republicans can do the same thing in reverse if they ever have \u2014 and I hope it\u2019s going to be a long time, because nobody has done a better job with the economy, with our military, with \u2014 I\u2019ve rebuilt the military.\u00a0 Our economy is the best it\u2019s ever been.\u00a0 We have numbers that just came out where, not including taxes, the median household income for the average American has increased $5,000 in a very short time since I\u2019ve been President.\u00a0 Nobody has ever heard of numbers like that.\nSo, people want to find out: Why was it so corrupt during that election?\u00a0 And I want to find out more than anybody else.\nSteve, go ahead.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of the things that has been exposed by this Turkey situation is that as many as 50 nuclear weapons are at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey.\u00a0 How confident are you of those weapons\u2019 safety?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 We\u2019re confident, and we have a great \u2014 a great air base there, a very powerful air base.\u00a0 That air base alone can take any place.\u00a0 It\u2019s a large, powerful air base.\nAnd, you know, Turkey \u2014 just so people remember \u2014 Turkey is a NATO member.\u00a0 We\u2019re supposed to get along with our NATO members, and Turkey is a NATO member.\u00a0 Do people want us to start shooting at a NATO member?\u00a0 That would be a first.\u00a0 And that\u2019s all involved having to do with NATO.\nYeah.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, you\u2019re going to be seeing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi today.\u00a0 How do you anticipate that conversation?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I\u2019d say this: I think that she\u2019s done this country a tremendous disservice.\u00a0 She\u2019s created a phony witch hunt \u2014 another one.\u00a0 The first one failed.\u00a0 They\u2019re all failing.\u00a0 This one is just absolutely crazy.\u00a0 All you have to do is read the transcript of the call.\u00a0 Read the transcript.\u00a0 This is a open and shut, simple case.\u00a0 They\u2019re desperate because they know they\u2019re going to lose the election.\u00a0 They\u2019re desperate to do something because they know they\u2019re going to lose the election.\nThis administration has created the strongest economy in the history of our country.\u00a0 We have the greatest stock market.\u00a0 We had \u2014 over 100 times, we broke the record for stock market.\u00a0 People\u2019s \u2014 if you look at people\u2019s stocks, their 401(k)s; if you look at anything you want to look at, they\u2019re far better off now than they probably ever have been in this country.\u00a0 Record stock markets.\u00a0 And don\u2019t forget, stock market is not just rich people; it\u2019s all people.\u00a0 Because all people own in the stock markets.\u00a0 The New York Stock Exchange, all of them \u2014 they\u2019re at record highs.\u00a0\u00a0 Nobody has ever done what we\u2019ve done.\nSo, they\u2019re playing games.\u00a0 They figure they can\u2019t win the election, so maybe we can find some ground.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019ll get somebody that Trump never met, and maybe they\u2019ll say something bad about Trump.\u00a0 And if they do really bad, maybe it can stick a little bit.\u201d\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work.\u00a0 They\u2019ve treated the Republican Party with great disrespect.\nOkay, thank you very much.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, how was your meeting with the Dunn family yesterday?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 My meeting with the family was really \u2014 it was beautiful, in a certain way.\u00a0 They did not want to meet with the person in question.\u00a0 But we had a very good meeting.\u00a0 They\u2019re very nice people.\u00a0 And we met with the full group.\u00a0 It was four people, actually, as you \u2014 you know how it\u2019s all broken up.\u00a0 And the meeting took place right here at about 6 o\u2019clock last night, and it was very sad, to be honest.\u00a0 She lost, and they lost, their son.\u00a0 I believe it was going down the wrong way, because that happens in Europe.\u00a0 You go to Europe and the roads are opposite.\u00a0 And it\u2019s very tough.\nIf you\u2019re from the United States, you do make that decision to make a right turn where you\u2019re supposed to make a left turn.\u00a0 The roads are opposite.\u00a0 And she said that\u2019s what happened.\u00a0 That happens to a lot of people, by the way.\u00a0 But she said that\u2019s what happened.\u00a0 She was in the room right out there.\u00a0 We met right here, in these \u2014 this area.\u00a0 And I offered to bring the person in question in, and they weren\u2019t ready for it.\u00a0 But I did offer.\nI spoke with Boris.\u00a0 He asked me if I\u2019d do that, and I did it.\u00a0 Unfortunately, they wanted to meet with her, and unfortunately when we had everybody together, they decided not to meet.\u00a0 Perhaps they had lawyers involved by that time.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know exactly.\u00a0 I know the people were lovely.\u00a0 They were very nice.\u00a0 And they were, you know, desperately sad.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And, sir, did you suggest that the family had indicated at one point that they were interested in meeting with her?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I thought they were.\u00a0 Based on what I saw, they wanted to meet.\u00a0 But now they say they only want to meet if they\u2019re in the UK.\u00a0 And that\u2019ll be up to them.\u00a0 But I did meet the family, and I expressed condolences on behalf of our country.\nThank you very much, everybody.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, because you\u2019re winning so much with the WTO, because you\u2019re growing the biggest economy \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Wait, there\u2019s a great question I\u2019m being asked.\u00a0 This is maybe the greatest question I\u2019ve been asked in a long time.\u00a0 Please put those mics over here.\u00a0 Go ahead.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Because you\u2019re winning with the WTO, because you\u2019re growing the biggest economy the world, are you willing to give Italy a break on tariffs?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 We are looking at Italy very strongly.\u00a0 And, as you know, the seven and a half is to be divided the way we say.\u00a0 We\u2019ve divided it up.\u00a0 Italy has got a problem with the way we\u2019ve divided it up because they said they had much less to do with it, and Germany had more to do with it, and France had more to do with it, as an example.\u00a0 So we are going to look at that very strongly.\u00a0 Ambassador Lighthizer is here.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to look at it very strongly.\nOkay?\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Good question.\u00a0 I love that question.\nThank you all very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you going to open up the meeting with Pelosi?\u00a0 Are you going to open up the meeting with Pelosi and bring us in?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yeah, I\u2019ll bring you in, right?\u00a0 I\u2019ll bring you in.\u00a0 They\u2019re doing a bad thing.\u00a0 I\u2019ll talk to you.\u00a0 I\u2019ll talk to you.\nThank you very much, everybody.\nSteve, please treat them nicely.\u00a0 Treat Italy nicely, please.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The translator did an amazing job.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Huh?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The translator did an amazing job.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t always happen.\u00a0 Thank you.\nEND\n11:06 A.M.

EDT\nPresident Trump Honors 2019 Stanley Cup Champions!\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great honor today.\u00a0 These are great champions behind me, great athletes.\u00a0 I always respect great athletes.\u00a0 But they\u2019re also very smart, because you can\u2019t win unless you\u2019re smart.\u00a0 It takes more than just the muscles, right?\u00a0 I think we\u2019ve all learned that.\nToday, it\u2019s my pleasure to welcome the Stanley Cup Champions, the St. Louis Blues.\u00a0 I watched it very carefully.\u00a0 I watched that season, and I saw, gee, they\u2019re not doing very well this year.\u00a0 But you\u2019ll see the story; it\u2019s an amazing story of comebacks.\nCongratulations to Head Coach Craig Berube and the Blues organization.\u00a0 And I just want to congratulate you guys.\u00a0 That is something.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Fantastic.\u00a0 Fantastic.\u00a0 And the entire team on winning your first Stanley Cup.\u00a0 And you\u2019ll probably have many more, based on what I\u2019m hearing.\nWe\u2019re delighted to be joined by Second Lady Karen Pence.\u00a0 Karen, thank you very much.\u00a0 Appreciate it.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Mike is getting ready to make a big trip.\u00a0 He\u2019ll be leaving tomorrow.\u00a0 We have a delegation leading today.\u00a0 And Mike is heading it up with Secretary Pompeo.\u00a0 They\u2019ll be leaving tomorrow.\nAnd we\u2019re having very strong talks with a lot of people.\u00a0 We want to bring our soldiers back home after so many years.\u00a0 And they\u2019re the greatest warriors in the world.\u00a0 They\u2019re policing.\u00a0 They\u2019re not a police force; they\u2019re a different kind of a force.\nWe want to bring our soldiers back home.\u00a0 And we\u2019re being very tough on Turkey and a lot of others.\u00a0 They have to maintain their own properties now.\u00a0 They have to maintain peace and safety.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll see what happens \u2014 the delegation.\u00a0 We\u2019re asking for a ceasefire.\u00a0 We put the strongest sanctions that you can imagine, but they get a lot.\u00a0 We have a lot in store if they don\u2019t \u2014 if they don\u2019t have an impact, including massive tariffs on steel.\u00a0 They ship a lot of steel to the United States.\u00a0 They make a lot of money shipping steel.\u00a0 They won\u2019t be making so much money.\nI just want to tell you that the stock market is way up today because of probably the trade deal that we made with China. We made a fantastic deal.\u00a0 You guys would\u2019ve been very proud of it.\u00a0 Your agents would\u2019ve been \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 your agents would\u2019ve been very proud.\u00a0 Those agents, right?\u00a0 They sit in bed, they weigh 350 pounds, and they complain: \u201cYou\u2019re not playing very well today.\u00a0 Come on.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So \u2014 the good, old agents.\u00a0 But they would\u2019ve been proud.\nWe\u2019re going to be selling to China about $50 billion worth of farm agricultural products.\u00a0 And \u2014 it\u2019s amazing.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And China has been great.\u00a0 China has really been great on this.\u00a0 And we have a phase two, and we\u2019re doing a lot with banking and with financial services already in phase one.\u00a0 Phase one is massive, actually.\u00a0 It\u2019s probably the simpler stuff, but, in some ways, maybe it\u2019s the most complicated.\u00a0 But it\u2019s very big numbers.\nSo I hear the most the farmers ever did was $16 billion, so I said, \u201cAsk for 70.\u201d\u00a0 They said, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t mean 70.\u00a0 Sixteen.\u00a0 Ask for 70.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cYeah, ask for 70.\u201d\u00a0 So we agreed on 50.\u00a0 And the only problem is they say the farmers can\u2019t produce it; it\u2019s too much.\u00a0 I said, \u201cDon\u2019t reduce it.\u201d\u00a0 My people said, \u201cAll right, make it 20.\u201d \u00a0I said, \u201cNo, make it 50.\u00a0 Let the farmers tell me we can\u2019t do it.\u201d\u00a0 The farmers will never say that because they\u2019ll do it.\u00a0 You guys know that, right?\nSo we have $50 billion worth of agriculture.\u00a0 It\u2019s the largest contract of its kind, by three times, ever signed.\u00a0 And China is starting immediately, even though the agreement will take \u2014 Gary, you get agreements done much more quickly.\u00a0 Gary Bettman, what a job.\u00a0 But the agreement will take probably until Chile.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to Chile for a meeting \u2014 as you know, a summit.\nAnd \u2014 hello, Mr. Senator.\u00a0 Look at my two great senators.\u00a0 Roy, stand up \u2014 even though I\u2019m going to introduce you in a second.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 How\u2019s our young \u2014 how\u2019s our young, incredible \u2014 how\u2019s our young, incredible Josh doing?\u00a0 Good job?\u00a0 Come on.\u00a0 Stand up, Josh.\u00a0 What a job.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nRoy and I said back \u2014 we said, \u201cWe need somebody that\u2019s really outstanding to beat her.\u201d\u00a0 I won\u2019t mention names.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And they had four or five candidates.\u00a0 I looked at four or five candidates.\u00a0 I said, \u201cI want him.\u201d\u00a0 And he really, under pressure, was unbelievable.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 We made a good choice, Roy, right?\u00a0 What do you think?\u00a0 Yes?\u00a0 One thing with Roy, he\u2019ll tell if it was no good.\u00a0 He\u2019ll tell you now.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s always dangerous.\u00a0 Right, Josh?\u00a0 Anyway, congratulations.\u00a0 Great job.\nBut we\u2019re delighted to be joined also by Secretary Alex Azar, who has been fantastic; and Andrew Wheeler, EPA \u2014 Andrew, thank you very much; and Robert Lighthizer.\u00a0 How are you doing with trade with other countries?\u00a0 Doing all right?\u00a0 All he does is contracts.\u00a0 He does contracts.\u00a0 In fact, he probably wants to leave now because he\u2019s got another contract.\u00a0 We just did one with Japan.\u00a0 We just did one with South Korea.\u00a0 China is happening.\u00a0 Mexico, Canada is happening, if they can ever get it approved.\u00a0 I doubt they will because it\u2019s Nancy Pelosi.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 They\u2019re too busy working on impeachment.\nAnd, by the way, we just hit the greatest economy we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s impeach the President.\u201d\u00a0 Isn\u2019t that a good idea?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t worry about it, fellas.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t worry about it.\u00a0 Don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t worry too much.\nHow are we doing, Roy?\u00a0 Okay in the Senate?\u00a0 I hear we\u2019re looking very good.\u00a0 I hear our senators \u2014 they\u2019re the greatest.\nI want to start by introducing a man that I\u2019ve known a little bit, but he\u2019s been a great business success: Tom Stillman.\u00a0 He\u2019s the majority owner of the St. Louis Blues.\u00a0 And Tom became the chairman of the Blues \u2014 had a great success in business, but we won\u2019t bore them with that.\u00a0 And \u2014 tremendous success, actually.\u00a0 Became the chairman of the Blues.\u00a0 And, in May of 2012, when he took over, he said, \u201cI have a plan for five years, six years, eight years.\u00a0 We got to make \u2014 we have to have a champion.\u201d\u00a0 And within seven years, they won the Stanley Cup \u2014 the beautiful Stanley Cup, right here.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 So that\u2019s a great job.\nYou know, he wasn\u2019t on the list to introduce.\u00a0 I said, \u201cWait a minute, he\u2019s the owner.\u201d\u00a0 They want to introduce everybody but the owner.\u00a0 I said, \u201cGive me a little information.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s a very good thing \u2014 seven years.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been waiting a little longer than that in New York, you know?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 We\u2019ve been waiting, but we\u2019ll get there.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to get there.\nWe also have some very proud Blues fans here with us.\u00a0 And we just introduced Senator Roy Blunt, who is a fantastic man, a great friend of mine.\u00a0 He\u2019s done an incredible job, and he loves your state very much.\u00a0 He loves your team.\u00a0 He loves your team.\u00a0 Roy, thank you very much.\nAnd, as I said, Josh Hawley \u2014 (applause) \u2014 who is a young, brilliant star of the Senate.\u00a0 And he\u2019s been doing fantastically well.\u00a0 And I want to thank you very much, Josh, for the job you\u2019re doing.\nRepresentatives Mike Bost \u2014 where\u2019s Mike?\u00a0 Mike.\u00a0 Stand up, Mike.\u00a0 Just stand up as I introduce.\u00a0 You got so many political people here.\u00a0 They\u2019re so \u2014 they\u2019re so afraid of not being here.\u00a0 They\u2019ll lose half of their vote if they\u2019re not here today.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 They all came back early because they didn\u2019t want to not be here.\u00a0 Right, Mike?\nRodney Davis \u2014 a great guy.\u00a0 Thank you, Rodney.\u00a0 John Katko.\u00a0 The great Billy Long.\u00a0 Thanks, John.\u00a0 Where\u2019s Billy?\u00a0 Billy, do an auction for the St. \u2014 auction the team off, please.\nREPRESENTATIVE LONG:\u00a0 (Inaudible) auction the Stanley Cup.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, come on.\u00a0 Come on over here, Billy.\u00a0 Come here.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 Auction.\u00a0 Auction off the Stanley Cup.\u00a0 And he didn\u2019t know I was going to \u2014 you won\u2019t believe this.\nREPRESENATIVE LONG:\u00a0 And I \u2014 I\u2019ve never been to auction school either, so.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 (Inaudible) buy the Stanley Cup.\nREPRESENATIVE LONG:\u00a0 All right, going to buy the Stanley Cup here.\u00a0 Hey, here \u2014 taking 25.\u00a0 What do you \u2014\u00a030 thousand dollars?\u00a0 How about a 30?\u00a0

(Inaudible.)\u00a0 Thank you.\nREPRESENTATIVE LONG:\u00a0 Hey, will you sign this?\u00a0 The last one brought $15,000.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I will.\u00a0 Give me a pen.\nREPRESENTATIVE LONG:\u00a0 He signed my St. Jude tie at the State of the Union.\u00a0 We gave the money \u2014 we auctioned it off for $15,000 to St. Jude.\u00a0 He\u2019s going to sign this one here.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I will sign it.\nREPRESENTATIVE LONG:\u00a0 This will be in next year\u2019s auction.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 This was not planned, by the way.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nREPRESENTATIVE LONG:\u00a0 What do you mean it wasn\u2019t planned?\u00a0 That plan \u2014 they stopped me at the gate.\u00a0 They said, \u201cStand over here.\u201d\u00a0 They didn\u2019t know I was coming!\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you, Billy.\u00a0 Oh, Billy.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Pretty \u2014 pretty good job, though.\u00a0 Didn\u2019t he do \u2014 isn\u2019t that pretty good?\u00a0 I think it\u2019s pretty good.\nAnd Blaine.\u00a0 Where\u2019s Blaine?\u00a0 Blaine Luetkemeyer.\u00a0 A friend of mine.\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Thank you, Blaine.\u00a0 Great job.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 That\u2019s a great job.\nJason Smith.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Jason.\u00a0 Thank you, Jason.\nA great hockey player \u2014 I must tell you, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re in that category, though, Pete.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 What do you think?\u00a0 I know you were really good.\u00a0 Do you know that he was a great player in his own right?\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 Pete Stauber.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 He was a good one.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd Ann Wagner.\u00a0 She wasn\u2019t a great player, but she\u2019s a great person.\nREPRESENTATIVE WAGNER:\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thanks, Ann.\nMissouri Governor, Mike Parson.\u00a0 Mike, great job.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And Attorney General Eric Schmitt.\u00a0 Eric.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd many other leaders \u2014 great leaders.\u00a0 And another leader \u2014 and I introduced him a little bit before, but the NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman.\u00a0 I\u2019ve known him so long; I refuse to say how long.\u00a0 It\u2019s a lot of years, right?\u00a0 A lot of years.\u00a0 A lot of success, too.\u00a0 Way to go, Gary.\u00a0 Way to go.\u00a0 It\u2019s an honor to have you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo what we were alluding to before is: In 2019, when the year started, you were true underdogs.\u00a0 Midway through the season, the Blues were ranked last in the NHL.\u00a0 I can\u2019t believe that, fellas.\u00a0 But don\u2019t worry, it gets better.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nYou only had 15 wins, you had 18 losses, and 4 ties.\u00a0 On January 6th, fresh off another really bad loss \u2014 a hard one; it was close, but it was bad \u2014 a few of the Blues players \u2014 it\u2019s still a loss, right?\u00a0 The losses are no good no matter by what.\u00a0 Does it matter if you lose them close, Tom, or \u2014 a loss is a loss, right?\nMR. STILLMAN:\u00a0 It\u2019s a loss.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, I think so.\u00a0 At least you have a little hope when they\u2019re close, right?\nBut they gathered at a bar in Philadelphia where they heard the 1982 hit, \u201cGloria.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s where you were \u2014 that\u2019s why we were playing that song, for those of you that don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened here.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 \u201cGloria.\u201d\nThe next day, you shut out the Flyers, who were hot, and \u201cGloria\u201d became your new \u201cwin song.\u201d\u00a0 It was a \u201cwin song\u201d; that\u2019s why we played it.\u00a0 So now everybody gets it, otherwise the fake news would be criticizing me.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 They\u2019d say, \u201cWhat kind of a song \u2014 you\u2019re playing this song.\u00a0 What does that have\u2026\u201d\nLook at that guy.\u00a0 Look at that mouth on that guy.\u00a0 Come here a minute.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Come here.\u00a0 Come here.\nDo you think he\u2019s taken a few hits?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Huh?\u00a0 Do you think he\u2019s tough?\u00a0 Do you think I could take him in a fight?\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 How do mine look?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 No hockey.\u00a0 That\u2019s great.\nOver the next few weeks, the Blues notched 11 straight wins, the longest winning streak in team history, and soon earned a place in the playoffs.\nIn the first round, you took on the Winnipeg Jets.\u00a0 Moments away from overtime in game five, the Blues\u2019 left wing, Jaden Schwartz, scored the winning goal in the last 15 seconds of regulation.\u00a0 And everybody else just took a deep breath and said, \u201cThat was close.\u201d\u00a0 Where\u2019s Jason?\u00a0 Jason?\nMR. PIETRANGELO:\u00a0 Jaden.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Oh, Jaden.\u00a0 Come here.\u00a0 Say a few words.\u00a0 Jaden.\nMR. SCHWARTZ:\u00a0 Oh, boy.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Jaden.\u00a0 And they say he\u2019s a great golfer, but \u2014\nMR. SCHWARTZ:\u00a0 Well \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t be able to score if it wasn\u2019t for partner passing me the puck.\u00a0 Where are you, Tyler?\u00a0 Golf partner, too.\nUndefeated.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Ooh.\nMR. SCHWARTZ:\u00a0 If you want to take us on sometime \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMR. SCHWARTZ:\u00a0 \u2014 let us know.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Fantastic job.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Fantastic.\u00a0 Thank you, Jaden.\nThe next game, St. Louis clinched the series after Jaden scored all three \u2014 Jaden, you\u2019re pretty good \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 all three of the Blues\u2019 goals.\u00a0 And, Jaden, your persistence made you the Blues\u2019 leader in the playoff goal scoring.\u00a0 That\u2019s a great job.\u00a0 After winning two more series, the Blues were off to the legendary Stanley Cup Finals, which everybody watches, everybody loves.\u00a0 Very special.\nIt was a matchup for the ages.\u00a0 With the series tied at 3-3, the Blues headed to Boston for the final showdown against a great team.\u00a0 Watching from the bleachers was your biggest fan, 11-year-old Laila Anderson, who is here with us today.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Where\u2019s Laila?\u00a0 Laila, stand up.\u00a0 Come on up here, Laila.\u00a0 Come on up here.\u00a0 Good job.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo, you all know Laila.\u00a0 Laila is a bigger celebrity than our two senators.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 They just hope that she\u2019s not going to be running against them someday.\u00a0 But it\u2019s a \u2014 really, an extraordinary story of a very heroic young woman.\nThroughout the season, Laila was bravely battling an extremely rare, life-threatening immune disease called HLH.\u00a0 Blues players visited her in the hospital constantly, and they hosted a bone marrow registry drive to help her get lifesaving treatment.\u00a0 Laila\u2019s mother, Heather, said \u2014 who is here \u2014 \u201cThese boys are what keeps [her] going.\u00a0 They\u2019re just incredible, incredible young men.\u201d\u00a0 Thank you very much for being here.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Very \u2014 very nice.\u00a0 Very nice.\nLaila received a bone marrow transplant in January and was strong enough to cheer the team on to victory in the final game. Laila, your exceptional courage and, frankly, the fact that you brought the team some luck \u2014 which is important, right?\u00a0 We all need a little of that.\u00a0 But we just want to thank you.\u00a0 You inspired the Blues all season, and today you continue to inspire all Americans.\u00a0 We all know your story.\nRight now, see all of those people back there?\u00a0 See?\u00a0 They look so friendly; they\u2019re not.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 They\u2019re not.\u00a0 They\u2019re tougher than these guys, okay?\u00a0 But I\u2019ll bank on these guys.\u00a0 So congratulations, darling.\u00a0 You take care of yourself, okay?\nMS. ANDERSON:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you, honey.\u00a0 Be careful.\nSo, the Stanley Cup Final was an extraordinary finish to a miraculous season.\u00a0 So you think of that, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re referring to.\u00a0 They started off so bad.\u00a0 It was so bad that even the commissioner was telling me it wasn\u2019t looking too good for this team.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 But they \u2014 they set records.\nWhen the puck dropped, the Blues did not strike right away.\u00a0 You only knew it took one shot on goal until the final minutes of the first period.\u00a0 Then, Stanley Cup MVP \u2014 what happened to Jaden with all the goals you \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 I think Jaden should be the MVP.\u00a0 No, I\u2019m only kidding.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Where\u2019s Ryan?\u00a0 Ryan O\u2019Reilly.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Where\u2019s Ryan?\nMR. STILLMAN:\u00a0 He\u2019s over here.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Come here.\u00a0 Come on up.\u00a0 That\u2019s pretty good. Say a couple of words.\nThanks, Ryan.\u00a0 That\u2019s enough.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMR. O\u2019REILLY:\u00a0 Well, I couldn\u2019t do it without these guys behind me.\u00a0 And we\u2019re a great team and it was a heck of a run.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And you\u2019re not Irish, are you, by any chance?\nMR. O\u2019REILLY:\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 I am.\u00a0 I am.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Great going, Ryan.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nRyan O\u2019Reilly.\u00a0 He scored the first goal of the game and became the first player since Wayne Gretzky \u2014 a great guy; really, a fantastic guy \u2014 in 1985 to score four consecutive Cup Final games.\u00a0 He scored in all of them.\u00a0 Ryan, congratulations on winning the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nAs the first period came to a close, Team Captain Alex Pietrangelo \u2014 where is he?\nMR. PIETRANGELO:\u00a0 Right here.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Where\u2019s Alex?\u00a0 Come on over here.\nMR. PIETRANGELO:\u00a0 Oh, boy.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Look at this guy.\u00a0 Come on, say a couple of words, Alex.\u00a0 Look, see that?\nMR. PIETRANGELO:\u00a0 Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You don\u2019t even get that for sports, right?\nMR. PIETRANGELO:\u00a0 No, no, no, no.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 This is a bigger deal than the sports.\u00a0 This is pretty cool.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 This is part of everything.\nMR. PIETRANGELO:\u00a0 Yeah, it\u2019s a pretty good group of guys back here, huh?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You better believe it.\nMR. PIETRANGELO:\u00a0 Yeah, big golfers.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\nMR. PIETRANGELO:\u00a0 Big golfers.\u00a0 I know you like that.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\nMR. PIETRANGELO:\u00a0 Well, thanks for having us.\u00a0 We appreciate it.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Great job.\nMR. PIETRANGELO:\u00a0 Appreciate it.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Great job.\u00a0 Thank you, Alex.\nAlex rushed forward and found that the back of the net was his, taking a two-nothing lead.\u00a0 But Boston didn\u2019t let up.\u00a0 It\u2019s a tough team.\u00a0 And I know the owner too.\u00a0 How\u2019s he doing?\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 Good man, right?\u00a0 Not so happy, unfortunately.\u00a0 But he\u2019s my friend. \u00a0But he wasn\u2019t so happy.\nThe Bruins took 33 shots on net during the game, and the Blues rookie goaltender \u2014 that\u2019s pretty good \u2014 Jordan Binnington \u2014 where\u2019s Jordan?\u00a0 Jordan.\u00a0 I got to find \u2014 come here.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 He stopped 32 of 33, so why didn\u2019t you stop the other one, Jordan?\u00a0 You could have made the game a lot easier.\u00a0 Come on.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMR. BINNINGTON:\u00a0 Yeah, first off, you know, that\u2019s my bad, I guess.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Could have had a shut-out there.\u00a0 But, you know, we went all that way so we had to finish the job and \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You did it.\nMR. BINNINGTON:\u00a0 \u2014 it was a great game.\u00a0 And, yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Fantastic.\nMR. BINNINGTON:\u00a0 We\u2019re happy we\u2019re here.\u00a0 Thanks.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So have you always had good reflexes?\nMR. BINNINGTON:\u00a0 I guess so.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 If you didn\u2019t, you\u2019d be in trouble.\nMR. BINNINGTON:\u00a0 Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 If you didn\u2019t, it wouldn\u2019t \u2014 wouldn\u2019t be pretty.\nMR. BINNINGTON:\u00a0 I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be here.\u00a0 No.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be \u2014 I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be here, right?\nMR. BINNINGTON:\u00a0 No.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s \u2014 great job, Jordan.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThirty-two of thirty-three.\u00a0 I guess that\u2019s good.\u00a0 Commissioner, that\u2019s pretty good, right?\u00a0 I think so.\nJordan, your astounding 97 percent save percentage held Boston to a single goal.\u00a0 That\u2019s pretty good, huh?\u00a0 After 52 years, the Blues finally, and triumphantly, raised the Stanley Cup.\u00a0 That\u2019s amazing.\u00a0 Fifty-two years.\u00a0 And you did it in seven, huh?\u00a0 Come here.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd the St. Louis Blues\u2019 amazing comeback reminds us to never give up, never lose faith, never, ever quit.\u00a0 Just keep forging ahead.\u00a0 You never know.\u00a0 Just keep forging ahead.\u00a0 But this team is really exemplary.\u00a0 Starting a season so badly, where they were in last place and people had written them off.\u00a0 And I think your fans are so loyal, frankly.\u00a0 They don\u2019t stop coming, Roy, do they?\u00a0 I don\u2019t think so.\u00a0 Josh, they came anyway.\u00a0 But they probably, sort of, gave up.\u00a0 They started \u2014 some of them.\u00a0 But it\u2019s incredible.\u00a0 Think of that: So they had a record streak, and then all of a sudden, they\u2019re in it and then they win and they keep winning.\nWhen you work hard, support each other, believe in yourself, and give everything you\u2019ve got, victory is always within reach.\nTo the St. Louis Blues: Congratulations again on your unforgettable season \u2014 that was a really a tremendous final; incredible \u2014 and the thrilling Stanley Cup win.\nAnd it\u2019s now my honor to invite up the Chairman \u2014 the man that we\u2019ve been talking about \u2014 seven \u2014 and we\u2019re going to call him Seven-Year Tom.\u00a0 That\u2019s actually a very quick period of time.\u00a0 But he\u2019s a great gentlemen and he\u2019ll say a few words about the team.\u00a0 Thank you.\nTom Stillman.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR. STILLMAN:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 And thanks so much for welcoming us to the White House today.\u00a0 It is a really an honor to be here and to be here with you.\u00a0 It\u2019s also an honor to be here with the group of guys that\u2019s behind me here.\u00a0 They showed tremendous not only skill and ability in their sport, but great character and persistence.\u00a0 I think they serve as a model for not only our sport, but other sports, about how to \u2014 how to live your life and, as you said, never giving up.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s a proud moment to be here with all of them.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And, Tom, you worked here, didn\u2019t you?\u00a0 Right in the area.\u00a0 You were working in government.\nMR. STILLMAN:\u00a0 I did work in government for a while.\u00a0 I was over there at the \u2014 at the Commerce Department in export controls for a while.\u00a0 So \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, if you ever get tired of doing this, maybe we can get you get back over there.

STILLMAN:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 Sure.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Come on over, Coach.\nMR.

BERUBE:\u00a0 It\u2019s all right.\u00a0 Up and down a little bit.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Better than \u2014 hey, better than last year, huh?\nMR. BERUBE:\u00a0 Yeah, better.\u00a0 It\u2019s been a little bit better.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been on a \u2014 quite a road trip here.\u00a0 A lot of stuff going on.\u00a0 Up in Canada, we went to the Hockey Hall of Fame, and we presented a Stanley Cup Ring to the Hockey Hall of Fame.\u00a0 So, these guys are going through a lot right now with a lot of travel and everything.\u00a0 And come \u2014 you know, coming here.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great honor.\u00a0 It\u2019s a \u2014 you know, we love it all, but it\u2019s just a lot on everybody right now.\u00a0 But we\u2019re getting home here today and \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 But now the pressure is off because you\u2019ve done it, so there\u2019s a lot less pressure.\nMR.

        "text": "Omni Shoreham Hotel\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 12, 2019\n6:47 P.M. EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 It is a great honor to be here.\u00a0 Tony; Pastor Brunson, who I have gotten to know very well \u2014 that was not easy, but we got him out, and got him back to his family.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And I want to thank you for that beautiful prayer.\u00a0 It means a lot.\nThis evening, I am deeply honored to be back with so many pastors and leaders and friends and patriots at the 2019 Values Voter Summit.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 You are the warriors on the frontiers defending American freedom.\u00a0 We meet tonight at a crucial moment in our nation\u2019s history.\u00a0 Our shared values are under assault like never before.\u00a0 Extreme left-wing radicals, both inside and outside government, are determined to shred our Constitution and eradicate the beliefs we all cherish.\u00a0 Far-left socialists are trying to tear down the traditions and customs that made America the greatest nation on Earth.\u00a0 They reject the principles of our Founding Fathers \u2014 principles enshrined into the Declaration of Independence, which proclaims that our rights come from our creator.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut despite the delusions of the radical left, all of us here today know that our rights come from God almighty, and they can never be taken away.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTogether, we will protect those God-given rights for our children, our children\u2019s children, and generations of Americans to come.\u00a0 On every front, the ultra-left is waging war on the values shared by everyone in this room.\u00a0 They are trying to silence and punish the speech of Christians and religious believers of all faiths.\u00a0 You know it better than anyone.\u00a0 They are trying to use the courts to rewrite the laws, undermine democracy, and force through an agenda they can\u2019t pass at the ballot box.\u00a0 They just can\u2019t seem to do it, can they?\nThey are trying to hound you from the workplace, expel you from the public square, and weaken the American family, and indoctrinate our children.\u00a0 They resent and disdain faithful Americans who hold fast to our nation\u2019s historic values.\u00a0 And, if given the chance, they would use every instrument of government power, including the IRS, to try to shut you down.\u00a0 They are using the IRS against me.\nGenerations of Americans before us did not work.\u00a0 They fight, they sacrifice, they do so much, but we will never ever \u2014 no matter what happens \u2014 surrender our liberty.\u00a0 The word \u201cliberty\u201d is so important.\u00a0 To the radical left: Together we will stand up to the socialists and we will win massive victories for family, for faith, and for freedom, just like the victory we had in 2016.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\nWith every bit of heart and soul, we will defend our country \u2014 the most just and virtuous republic in the history of the Earth.\u00a0 And yet I say that, and those words are beautiful, but it is starting to change.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to stop that start.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThe hateful spirit that consumes the modern left violates every tenant of the American tradition.\u00a0 The radical left tolerates no dissent.\u00a0 It permits no opposition.\u00a0 It accepts no compromise.\u00a0 And we \u2014 look, we have all seen it; we see what\u2019s going on.\u00a0 There is no compromise.\u00a0 Frankly, these people are crazy.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 They\u2019re crazy.\u00a0 They are crazy.\u00a0 I shouldn\u2019t say it, because we\u2019re all the same, but they are crazy.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nAnd as we have seen in the last three years, the extreme left has absolutely no respect for the will of the American people.\u00a0 They are determined to stop our movement and impose their agenda by any means necessary.\u00a0 It makes no difference to them.\nFirst, it was the Russia hoax.\u00a0 It was a total hoax \u2014 made up.\u00a0 Then there was the outrageous smearing of Justice Kavanaugh \u2014 that goes on.\u00a0 They want him impeached, even when the woman said, \u201cI don\u2019t know that anything happened.\u00a0 Nothing happened.\u201d\u00a0 They said, \u201cLet\u2019s impeach him anyway.\u201d\u00a0 And the whole thing was phony.\u00a0 So phony.\u00a0 He\u2019s a good man.\u00a0 What he\u2019s gone through, I don\u2019t know if anyone\u2019s ever gone through anything like that.\nYou know, when I chose Justice Kavanaugh, I said, \u201cBrett, congratulations.\u00a0 I\u2019m choosing you.\u201d\u00a0 Many years, they were talking he would be on the Supreme Court.\u00a0 He said, \u201cSir, this is the greatest honor of my life.\u201d\u00a0 This was in the White House.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s the greatest honor of my life.\u201d\nI said, \u201cBrett, this will go so fast.\u00a0 This will be so easy.\u00a0 You\u2019re perfect.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 \u201cYou have the perfect family, the perfect wife, the perfect education.\u00a0 You\u2019re the best student.\u00a0 You went to the best school.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been talking about you for 10 years.\u00a0 This will go quick and easy.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So much for predictions, folks.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut we stuck with him, I\u2019ll tell you.\u00a0 A lot \u2014 a lot of people said, \u201cLet\u2019s do it (inaudible).\u201d\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Plenty of people said, \u201cCut him loose, President.\u00a0 Cut him loose, President.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 You know that.\u00a0 You know a lot of the people \u2014 a couple of the people in this room.\u00a0 I love you; I\u2019m never going to reveal your name, but the people in this room.\u00a0 They said, \u201cCut him loose, President.\u00a0 Cut him loose.\u201d\nI said, \u201cCan\u2019t do it.\u00a0 He\u2019s done nothing wrong.\u00a0 They\u2019re phony stories about him.\u00a0 They were made up, just like they were made up about me and other people.\u00a0 They were phony stories.\u00a0 Can\u2019t do it, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nAnd we got him through.\u00a0 And I give a lot of respect to those people that went up there, and they endured a lot.\u00a0 That was the worst thing that many people have seen in this country for years.\u00a0 Justice Kavanaugh.\u00a0 It\u2019s a big moment in our country\u2019s history.\nAnd now it is the outrageous impeachment \u2014 look, impeachment.\u00a0 I never thought I\u2019d see or hear that word with regard to me \u2014 \u201cimpeachment.\u201d\u00a0 I said, the other day, \u201cIt\u2019s an ugly word.\u201d\u00a0 To me, it\u2019s an ugly word \u2014 a very ugly word.\u00a0 It means so much.\u00a0 It means horrible, horrible crimes and things.\u00a0 I can\u2019t even believe it.\nIt\u2019s a witch hunt.\u00a0 It\u2019s based on a single phone call of congratulations to the President of Ukraine, which they fraudulently mischaracterized to sound absolutely horrible.\u00a0 This crooked Adam Schiff \u2014\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Booo \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 made a statement \u2014 long, beautiful statement \u2014 and it was a fraud.\u00a0 He repeated my call, but it wasn\u2019t me.\u00a0 He made it so bad.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to go after him.\u201d\u00a0 They say, \u201cSir\u2026\u201d\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 They say, \u201cSir, he has immunity because he said it in Congress.\u00a0 He has immunity.\u201d\u00a0 I say, \u201cI don\u2019t care about immunity.\u00a0 He can\u2019t have immunity; he made up a phone call.\u201d\nBut then I did something that they didn\u2019t expect.\u00a0 I immediately called up Ukraine, through my representatives \u2014 in this case, our great Secretary of State, who\u2019s doing a fantastic job.\u00a0 Mike Pompeo.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And got approval \u2014 because I have to do this, because I don\u2019t like the idea of having these calls \u2014 do you do how bad that is for us as a nation?\u00a0 And got approval to immediately make that call public.\nAnd they thought it was strange, you know?\u00a0 They thought it was a little bit strange. \u00a0\u201cWhy would you want to do that?\u201d\u00a0 You know, other countries are looking at us like, \u201cWhat the hell is going on in the United States?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Seriously.\nNow, does this mean that every leader that I deal with \u2014 and we do great things.\u00a0 Look at we did yesterday with China for our farmers and for our people.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 But does that mean, every time I speak to the head of a country, they\u2019re afraid that it\u2019s going to be broadcast all over the world?\u00a0 You\u2019re never going to be able to speak properly to anybody, to make a deal, to do good things for the people, and \u2014 even the people of the world.\nSo we had a perfect call.\u00a0 It was congenial.\u00a0 It was just absolutely nice.\u00a0 Totally different than the phony thing that he revealed with this crazy whistleblower.\u00a0 The whistleblower said \u201cquid pro quo\u201d eight times.\u00a0 It was a little off \u2014 no times.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\nAnd when you hear Schiff \u2014 \u201cWe won\u2019t give you that money unless you do this.\u201d\u00a0 It had nothing to do \u2014 it wasn\u2019t even discussed.\u00a0 It was a terrible, terrible fraudulent thing.\u00a0 And then Nancy Pelosi went on television.\u00a0 She was very angry when she read the actual call, because this was an exact \u2014 I guess stenographers, they took it down.\nAnd she was very angry because she got led \u2014 she was a day early when she started talking about impeachment.\u00a0 But that did not matter to her.\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s do it anyway.\u201d\u00a0 And for those of you that think she was reasoned for the last six months \u2014 you know, when she said, \u201cNo, no, no.\u00a0 We need more\u2026\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cShe\u2019s going to do it.\u00a0 She just wants to have it carried out closer to the election.\u00a0 She\u2019s going to do it.\u201d\nNot a good person.\u00a0 I think she hates our country.\u00a0 Because if she didn\u2019t hate our country, she wouldn\u2019t be doing this to our country.\u00a0 It\u2019s a fraud.\u00a0 It\u2019s a fraud.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut she said to George Stephanopoulos \u2014 I give him credit \u2014 \u201cNo, no, he said the truth.\u201d\u00a0 Stephanopoulos said, \u201cNo, no, but that wasn\u2019t what he said.\u00a0 He said an entirely \u2014 this was totally different.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo, no, he said it.\u201d\nIn other words, they\u2019re of the opinion \u2014 you know, just keep saying it, saying it, saying it, and maybe someday they\u2019ll believe it.\nAnd, frankly, if I weren\u2019t there, because I was incredulous \u2014 I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u00a0 I heard it.\u00a0 I said, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I said.\u201d\u00a0 He made up a conversation.\u00a0 And it was vicious, what he said.\nAnd then we caught him.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cHe has to pay a big price.\u201d\u00a0 And they said, \u201cSir, he has total immunity because he was in the great chamber, talking to congressmen, talking to the American public, lying and cheating, and there\u2019s supposed to be nothing we can do about it.\u201d\u00a0 But he also went outside and, as usual, he talked to the press, and he said a lot of what he said to the press.\u00a0 So we\u2019re going to take a look at it.\u00a0 We are going after these people.\u00a0 These are bad, bad people.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI actually told my lawyers, I said, \u201cSue him anyway.\u201d\u00a0 He\u2019s got immunity, but they can\u2019t mean immunity for that.\u00a0 I said, \u201cSue him anyway.\u00a0 Even if we lose, the American public will understand.\u201d\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And sue Nancy Pelosi, or maybe we should just impeach them.\u00a0 Because they\u2019re lying, and what they are doing is a terrible thing for our country.\nAnd the President of Ukraine said there was nothing wrong with the call.\u00a0 And you heard the words; there was no pressure.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t even know what we were talking about.\u00a0 He said, \u201cNo, it was a very nice call.\u201d\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t know.\u00a0 He tru- \u2014 I tell you what, I respect him so much.\u00a0 Because a lot of times, they\u2019re \u2014 \u201cI do not want to comment.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to get involved.\u201d\u00a0 He said, \u201cIt was a very nice call.\u201d\u00a0 There was nothing there.\nAnd people that read it after we gave the transcript said it was great.\u00a0 I had one friend \u2014 very smart, brilliant lawyer, from New York.\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t like your call with Ukraine, Mr.\u00a0 President.\u201d\u00a0 He used to call me Donald, now he calls me Mr.\u00a0 President.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 For the long- \u2014 30 years, he calls me Donald, now it\u2019s \u2014 all of these guys.\u00a0 Nobody calls me Donald anymore.\u00a0 I lost all my friends; they call me Mr.\u00a0 President.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It\u2019s true.\u00a0 It\u2019s true.\nHe goes, \u201cMr.\u00a0 President\u2026\u201d\u00a0 I keep saying, \u201cCall me Donald.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cPresident, I didn\u2019t like \u2014 I didn\u2019t like that call to the Ukrainian President.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cReally?\u00a0 What do you mean?\u00a0 What was wrong with it?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIt was terrible, the way you threatened him.\u00a0 It was horrible.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cI didn\u2019t threaten him.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cOf course you did.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhere did you read it?\u00a0 Did you read\u2026\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t read it.\u00a0 I listened to what Adam Schiff was reading.\u00a0 I assumed that was a correct statement.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cNo.\u201d\nHe then calls me back after reading it.\u00a0 He said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never seen anything like that.\u201d\u00a0 A lot of people saw that.\u00a0 A lot of people that thought it was bad, thought it was bad because they heard Adam Schiff.\u00a0 And they don\u2019t hear us talking.\u00a0 They don\u2019t know what we\u2019re saying.\u00a0 They hear \u2014 they think that, you know, it\u2019s somebody standing \u2014 he\u2019s reading it like I said it.\u00a0 It is a terrible thing going on in this country.\nBut they\u2019re using that call to impeach your President who won, in 2016, perhaps the greatest election of our time.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And I won it for you; I didn\u2019t win it for me.\u00a0 I won it for you and others, I won it for you.\u00a0 They are coming \u2014 I won it for you and others, but I won it for you.\nThey\u2019re coming after me because I\u2019m fighting for you.\u00a0 It\u2019s a big part of it.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And I\u2019m fighting for all Americans and our way of life, but I\u2019m fighting for you.\u00a0 And they don\u2019t like you.\u00a0 They don\u2019t like you.\u00a0 And you explain why.\u00a0 You explain why.\u00a0 Your values are so incredible.\u00a0 They don\u2019t like you.\u00a0 Nobody in this room would do what Adam Schiff did.\u00a0 Nobody would ever think of it.\nBy the way, he only did it because he never thought that I was going to release the transcript.\u00a0 Had he thought I was \u2014 and I didn\u2019t even know I was going to release anything before I did it.\u00a0 But I said, \u201cRelease\u2026\u201d\u00a0 How transparent can you get, right?\nThey\u2019re saying we\u2019re holding back.\u00a0 Holding back?\u00a0 I gave the transcript of the call.\u00a0 But he did it and then I released the transcript.\u00a0 They never thought in a million years \u2014 even in terms of violation with another country, but we got approval.\nSo, he\u2019s very embarrassed, but he gets up to the microphone \u2014 remember he used to say, \u201cWell, I have personal proof that the President was very closely aligned with Russia.\u00a0 Russia.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I\u2019m watching him and, even me, I\u2019m starting to say, \u201cDoes he know something that I don\u2019t know?\u201d (Laughter.)\nYou know, he gets up with his very \u2014 very narrow neck.\u00a0 You remember?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Pencil neck.\u00a0 Dana, you would not be impressed with him, physically.\u00a0 But he gets up \u2014 no dummy, but he\u2019s a crooked person.\u00a0 Smart guy.\u00a0 He\u2019s crooked as hell.\u00a0 And this is what they\u2019re using to \u2014 and they\u2019re going to be very unsuccessful.\u00a0 But that is what they are using \u2014 this call \u2014 to try to impeach the President of the United States, who did win one of the great elections of all time.\u00a0 All time.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd it couldn\u2019t have come at a better time, because if we would had lost that, we would have been in a lot of trouble.\u00a0 We\u2019d have had a very different country right now.\u00a0 Even with China, the other day, they were saying it\u2019s incredible what you\u2019ve done.\u00a0 Our economy is up many, many trillions of dollars.\u00a0 Their economy is down many, many trillions of dollars.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Big gap.\nWe would have been number two by now if our opponent had won.\u00a0 They would have been way ahead of us, and now they\u2019re way behind.\u00a0 And that\u2019s okay.\nWe made a great deal yesterday.\u00a0 We have yet to get it papered, but we will.\u00a0 Because they want to make that deal.\u00a0 They want to make that deal because they\u2019ve never had pressure like this.\nAnd I don\u2019t blame China, by the way.\u00a0 I blame the people that were leading our country for 25 years, allowing that to happen \u2014 where $500 billion is being taken out of our country and given to China so they can rebuild their entire empire.\u00a0 So I never blamed China, and I say that openly.\u00a0 I say it in every speech.\u00a0 I don\u2019t blame China.\u00a0 I wish we could have done it to them.\u00a0 I would have loved it.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And now maybe we are.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\nThey\u2019re trying to destroy anyone opposed to their goal of fundamentally transforming the United States of America.\u00a0 The one thing about the radical Democrats that is something that you have to admire: They stick together.\u00a0 The Republicans don\u2019t, and I love the Republicans.\nThey have horrible policies \u2014 the Democrats.\u00a0 They are for sanctuary cities \u2014 the Democrats.\u00a0 They are against strong, powerful, beautiful \u2014 I love our law enforcement.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 They believe in open borders, where anybody can come into our country \u2014 anybody.\u00a0 You have to see.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve done a great job.\u00a0 No support, only opposition.\nWe have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border and the numbers are dropped, like, off the table.\u00a0 And I want to thank the President of Mexico and Mexico for doing an incredible job.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut the Democrats have one thing: They stick together.\u00a0 They\u2019re like glue.\u00a0 And it\u2019s been that way for a long time \u2014 not just now.\u00a0 For whatever it is, it\u2019s been that way for a long time, and it\u2019s the one trait that I do respect and even admire.\u00a0 They stick together.\u00a0 They don\u2019t have people coming out against the President.\nAnd, you know, I am at 94 percent approval rating, but still you have people out there \u2014 they don\u2019t get it.\u00a0 They don\u2019t get it.\u00a0 So we love the Republicans.\u00a0 We love what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 We love our programs.\u00a0 And in many cases, we\u2019re better politicians than them.\u00a0 We have much better policies.\u00a0 We want strong borders.\u00a0 We want powerful education.\u00a0 We want freedom of speech.\u00a0 We want a strong military.\nWe want a powerful Second Amendment, which they don\u2019t want.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Right, Dana?\u00a0 They don\u2019t want \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re too much into the Second Amendment, the world of the Second Amendment.\u00a0 I will tell you, if certain of these people \u2014 I would say almost anyone \u2014 your Second Amendment is in serious, serious trouble.\u00a0 Serious trouble.\nSocialism is obsessed with the pursuit of power because it has replaced religion within government.\u00a0 And in their eyes, it has absolutely replaced religion.\u00a0 When you look at some of the things that they\u2019re in favor of, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s like anything \u2014 nobody has ever seen anything like it.\nThe New Green or Green New \u2014 you can say it either way, by the way.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter; same thing.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0 Somebody said, \u201cWhich comes first?\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any difference.\u00a0 They\u2019re both crazy.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 No cows, no planes, no people, no energy, no oil, no gas \u2014 no nothing.\nThis evening, we reaffirm true foundations of American society.\u00a0 We believe that every American has the right to live by the dictates of their conscience and the teachings of their faith.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We believe in the right to free exercise of religion.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Four more years!\u00a0 Four more years!\u00a0 Four more years!\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 All right, thank you very much.\nYou know, years ago, you could have said that, and people would have said, \u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0 And, you know, it would have been sort of routine.\u00a0 Today, you say it and you get standing ovations, because we\u2019re under assault.\u00a0 Very simple.\u00a0 We\u2019re under assault.\nWe believe in the right to free speech.\u00a0 We believe in the right to life.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\nWe know that families and churches, not government officials, know best how to create strong and loving communities.\u00a0 It\u2019s been that way in our country.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd above all else, we know this: In America, we don\u2019t worship government, we worship god.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\nYou were there.\u00a0 From the first minute of my presidency, I have taken historic action to defend religious liberty.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Tony knows that very well.\u00a0 Tony wasn\u2019t sure \u2014 really sure I would say at the beginning.\u00a0 What do you think? I don\u2019t know him very well.\u00a0 But I think you are very happy now, Tony.\u00a0 Right? (Applause.)\nSomething I am very proud of: I stopped the Johnson Amendment from interfering with pastors\u2019 rights to speak their mind.\u00a0 You can say whatever you want, you\u2019re the people we want to hear from.\u00a0 We want to hear from you.\nWe are protecting the conscience rights and \u2014 think of this \u2014 those rights of doctors, and nurses, and teachers, and groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor.\u00a0 They are incredible people.\u00a0 And we are preserving our country\u2019s vital tradition of faith-based adoption.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAs you know, just a few days ago, a Democrat running for President proposed revoking the tax-exempt status of many churches and religious groups.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Booo \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And you know why, and you know who it is.\u00a0 He\u2019s a wacko.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nI will never allow the federal government to be used to target, harass, or punish communities of faith.\u00a0 And I will never allow the IRS to be used as a political weapon, as it has been and currently is \u2014 it is currently being used.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 But has been used so viciously, so violently against many people in this room.\nVirtually every top Democrat lawmaker also now supports taxpayer-funded abortion, right up to the moment of birth.\u00a0 But it\u2019s really now even worse than that.\u00a0 The governor of Virginia \u2014 do you remember?\u00a0 He was on a show and he talked.\u00a0 People said, \u201cWhat did you say?\u00a0 What was that?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cThe baby is born, then we have a conversation with the mother as to whether or not\u201d \u2014 what he meant \u2014 \u201cas to whether or not we execute the baby, because now it is an execution.\u201d\u00a0 And that was a very big moment.\u00a0 And they don\u2019t do anything about it.\nThat was an unbelievable moment for the people in this room.\u00a0 For the people on the radical left, they didn\u2019t understand what was wrong with what he said.\u00a0 That\u2019s where we\u2019ve come.\u00a0 But we\u2019re going now in a different direction.\u00a0 And don\u2019t forget \u2014 (applause).\nWhen I go after what I call the \u201cFake News\u201d \u2014 I call it the \u201cCorrupt News\u201d too, because it is stronger than fake.\u00a0 But \u201cfake\u201d sort of reads a little better.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 There they are.\nBut when I go after the Fake News, I had a magazine for one of the many covers \u2014 I\u2019ve been on so many of the covers of this particular magazine \u2014 Time magazine.\u00a0 And we were talking; they were in my office.\u00a0 I figured, \u201cLet me give a shot at having an interview.\u00a0 Maybe I\u2019ll get a better story out of these people.\u201d\nSo we had a nice talk.\u00a0 And I was talking about how unfairly the press treats me and you.\u00a0 They treat us all very, very badly.\u00a0 No matter what we do, doesn\u2019t matter; it\u2019ll never be considered good.\u00a0 And if it\u2019s just a neutral, it\u2019s a horror.\u00a0 And if it\u2019s something bad \u2014 I hate to say it \u2014 it is like the electric chair, okay?\u00a0 \u201cBring back the electric chair,\u201d they say.\nBut I was talking and I was going off fact after fact after fact about how crooked and corrupt the media is.\u00a0 Then I realized: I\u2019m in the Oval Office.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cBut I\u2019m President and you\u2019re not, so what\u2019s this all about?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 It\u2019s true.\u00a0 I\u2019m saying, I\u2019m going on for 20 minutes, ranting and raving.\u00a0 And then I said, \u201cWait a minute, here I am.\u00a0 Here I am.\u00a0 The Resolute Desk \u2014 here it is.\u00a0 It\u2019s right there.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I walked away with a big smile on my face.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\nBut because of the late-term abortion \u2014 this is why I\u2019ve asked Congress to prohibit the late-term abortion of babies, and it\u2019s a big thing and had a lot of fighting.\u00a0 You wouldn\u2019t think there would be a lot of fighting.\nRemember the debate with Crooked Hillary, where I said she wants to rip the babies out of the womb in the ninth month?\u00a0 And everybody said, \u201cWow.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s the first time they heard that statement.\u00a0 And you\u2019re just lucky that we won \u2014 because we won.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t win; we won.\u00a0 This would be a much different country.\nAnd, by the way, it\u2019s like a plant.\u00a0 You seed the plant, you put that plant in, but those roots have to gain.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we need the next four years.\u00a0 We have to have \u2014 those roots, they have to grab on.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we need them.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe\u2019ve done so much.\u00a0 There\u2019s been no administration that\u2019s done what we have done in the first two and a half years \u2014 now it\u2019s almost three years.\u00a0 If you look at everything we\u2019ve done with taxes, and regulations, and Right to Try, and all of the different things that we\u2019ve done.\u00a0 The vets, the military \u2014 we\u2019ve rebuilt our military.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe had a general come to my office \u2014 respected general.\u00a0 And we were having big trouble with one country \u2014 first week in office, very early.\u00a0 He said, \u201cSir, we have no ammunition.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cYou know what?\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have ammunition \u2014 a lot of it.\u00a0 And hopefully we\u2019ll never going to have to use it, but we have a lot of it.\u201d\u00a0 But I also said, \u201cI never want to have another President of the United States hear those words from a general.\u201d\u00a0 Because does that put us in bad position, right?\nIn this administration, we believe every child, born and unborn, is made in the holy image of God.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 During my first week in office, I reinstated the Mexico City Policy to protect the lives of the unborn.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We have issued a final rule to prohibit Title X taxpayer funding from subsidizing the abortion industry.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We stopped federal funding of fetal tissue research.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMy administration has also made tremendous progress in fighting back against the left\u2019s effort to use the federal courts to impose their fringe ideology and crush the same religious liberty that we have been speaking of tonight.\u00a0 To defend our Constitution, we have confirmed more than 160 highly qualified judges to interpret the law as written, including two incredible new Supreme Court justices.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYou know, I have always heard that federal judges, judges, and Supreme Court justices \u2014 most important decision a President could make.\u00a0 And I disagreed.\u00a0 I always said, \u201cYou know, look, defense to me has got always to be number one.\u201d\nBut I got it.\u00a0 I said, \u201cYou know, it is.\u00a0 It\u2019s really incredible.\u201d\u00a0 And usually, when a President comes to office, there\u2019s no \u2014 you have no vacancies.\u00a0 Or the previous President would have \u2014 boom.\u00a0 There should be no vacancy, you know, whatever their ideology is.\nBut I guess they thought that the crooked one was going to win or something.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So I came in and, in the first couple of days, they said, \u201cBy the way\u2026\u201d\u00a0 You know, I had a couple of other things going, too \u2014 including the fact that a few minutes after I was sworn in, the Washington Post wrote a story that the impeachment starts right now.\u00a0 You saw that, right?\u00a0 Did you see that?\nRight after I got sworn \u2014 took the oath of office, they did that story \u2014 literally, a very few moments after the swearing-in \u2014 that the road to impeachment starts right now.\nBut I had a lot of other things.\u00a0 But I said during the course of the first very early period, like a week \u2014 I said, \u201cBy the way, how many federal judgeships do I have?\u201d\u00a0 They said, \u201cSir, you have 142.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 \u201cYou have 142, sir.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u00a0 142?\u00a0 You mean I have two, one, none?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo, you have 142.\u201d\nAnd President Obama was not very good at getting it done, because, you know, people held him up and everything else.\u00a0 But, with time, you get them all done.\u00a0 You get them done.\u00a0 But he put a big rush on at the end when he saw we were doing well in the polls, and coming up and up, and it wasn\u2019t enough time.\u00a0 So we inherited 142 open federal judgeships, including the court of appeals.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 First time in history.\u00a0 First time in history anything like that has ever happened.\nAnd then they say, \u201cOh, he was a great President.\u00a0 Oh, great.\u00a0 He was great.\u201d\u00a0 Great for who?\u00a0 He was great for us.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And in that way, he was.\u00a0 There\u2019s never been a better President for the Republicans in what they consider the most important way, Tony.\u00a0 Gave us 142 judgeships on the first day in office.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nAnd you go back and check it out, you\u2019ll find that others left none, usually none \u2014 or one or two \u2014 but one, none.\u00a0 One hundred and forty-two.\nAnd then we have extras that we got through attrition, through retirement, through death.\u00a0 And then we will very shortly \u2014 in less than a couple of months, we\u2019ll have 182 federal judgeships, including \u2014 including appeals judges, court of appeals.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 One hundred and eighty-two.\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\nAnd, you know, we were getting killed with the court decisions.\u00a0 If you look at our first few months, I think it was oh for seven; oh for eight.\u00a0 Then we won one, and a news- \u2014 a newspaper \u2014 I think it was the failing New York Times \u2014 what would they do without me?\u00a0 You know, the paper was dead until I came along.\nTwo months before I ran, I remember holding one up, it was like from a grocery store.\u00a0 You know, the things that you hand out?\u00a0 It was like this.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It\u2019s all right.\u00a0 When we leave in 10 or 14 years, they\u2019ll fail.\u00a0 They\u2019ll fail.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I\u2019m only kidding, by the way.\u00a0 You know, they\u2019ll take it for real.\u00a0 \u201cI told you he wants to stay.\u201d\nDid you see the crazy comedian?\u00a0 I won\u2019t even give them the name, but you know who.\u00a0 He said \u2014 he was interviewing a guest a couple of weeks ago.\u00a0 He said \u2014 you know, a very liberal guest.\u00a0 He said, \u201cYou know he\u2019s going to win, don\u2019t you?\u00a0 You know he\u2019s going to win.\u201d\u00a0 And the guest said, \u201cNo, no, we\u2019re going to fight very hard.\u00a0 We have a chance.\u00a0 No, no, we\u2019re going to fight.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo, no.\u00a0 He\u2019s going to win, and you know he\u2019s not leaving after that, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.) \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s going to stay.\u00a0 There is no way we\u2019re ever going to get him out of office.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nAnd I thought that he was, you know, kidding.\u00a0 He was really \u2014 believed it.\u00a0 So, you know what?\u00a0 Let him believe it.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s great.\u00a0 Let him believe it.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 True.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 He\u2019s never leaving.\nIn recent years, the hard left has tried to muzzle Christian voices in their aggressive attack on free speech.\u00a0 Last year, Isabella Chow, a member of student government at the University of California, Berkeley \u2014 slightly liberal out there \u2014 abstained from a campus vote that violated her Christian faith.\nShe was cruelly condemned by the student government and kicked out of nearly every single club of which she was a member at college.\nOn the day that members of student government condemned her \u2014 they went after her like nobody would believe \u2014 she sent out this message: The Christian community is here to love and serve this campus.\u00a0 And Isabella is here somewhere tonight \u2014 where is Isabella?\u00a0 Beautiful.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We salute you.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Isabella.\nTo safeguard the rights of students like Isabella, my administration has taken historic action to withhold taxpayer dollars \u2014 we\u2019re talking about billions of dollars, by the way \u2014 from schools that infringe upon student\u2019s First Amendment freedoms and other people\u2019s First Amendment freedom.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nDo you notice they\u2019ve been treating us much better lately?\u00a0 They\u2019re saying, \u201cYou know, we better let this person speak.\u201d\u00a0 We get a lot of millions of dollars every year, these schools \u2014 all of a sudden, they\u2019re letting them speak.\u00a0 But they still don\u2019t speak properly about us.\u00a0 We don\u2019t like that.\u00a0 But it\u2019s really had a big impact.\nTo support American families, we doubled the child tax credit and cut a record number of job-killing regulations.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe\u2019ve created over 6 million new jobs since the election; nobody would have believed that.\u00a0 If I said that, Tony, the media back there \u2014 the wonderful people in the media \u2014 would have said, \u201cHe\u2019s exaggerating.\u201d\u00a0 I would have never said \u201csix,\u201d actually.\nAnd you have to go by the day after the election, because, you know, when you look, the day after the election, there was euphoria and the market went up tremendously before signing.\u00a0 And Obama gets credit.\u00a0 The market was crashing.\u00a0 The market would have gone down the tubes.\u00a0 So I said, \u201cWhy did he get all of that upside?\u201d\u00a0 They only did the upside for two and a half months or whatever it was between, let\u2019s say, November 9th and January 20th.\u00a0 They only did the upside because we got elected.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 If he would have gotten elected, it would have not been a good situation.\nLast month, unemployment reached the lowest rate in over 51 years.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And you have heard me say this: African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment rates have all set record lows.\nAnd women, 71 years \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, you didn\u2019t break a record.\u00a0 But we\u2019re doing very well with the women.\u00a0 Do you know why?\u00a0 Women are so smart, and they want safety, they want security, they want a great military, they want strong borders.\u00a0 Remember last time?\u00a0 \u201cHe will not get the women\u2019s vote.\u00a0 There is no way to get to 270.\u201d\u00a0 You needed 270 electoral votes.\u00a0 \u201cHe will not get the women\u2019s vote.\u201d\u00a0 Then, after the election, they said, \u201cMan, he did good with the women.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 \u201cHe did good with the women.\u201d\nThis is like a tape recording \u2014 the same thing now.\u00a0 \u201cHe will not get the women\u2019s vote.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cReally? They don\u2019t want to have a strong military?\u00a0 They don\u2019t want to have security?\u00a0 They don\u2019t want to have safety?\u201d\nWe\u2019re working harder than any other administration has ever worked on opioid and drugs, and our numbers are coming way down.\u00a0 Nobody has seen numbers like this.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Nobody has seen numbers like what we\u2019ve done.\nWe\u2019ve lifted 1.3 American children out of poverty.\u00a0 Our agenda is lifting up Americans of every background, race, religion, color, and creed.\u00a0 Last year, with the help of many faith leaders \u2014 many of you are in the room right now \u2014 I signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform into law.\u00a0 Everybody wanted that.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 The African American community wanted it so badly.\u00a0 They couldn\u2019t get it.\u00a0 President Obama couldn\u2019t get it done.\u00a0 Previous Presidents couldn\u2019t get it done.\u00a0 We got it done.\nTo protect the wellbeing of our citizens, we\u2019re fighting violent crime \u2014 securing our border, building the wall.\u00a0 And it is going up rapidly, by the way.\u00a0 Rapidly.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 You think that was an easy one?\u00a0 That was a tough one.\u00a0 And it\u2019s the \u2014 I said the \u201cRolls Royce.\u201d\u00a0 They criticized me on that.\u00a0 They said that car is not made in the United States.\u00a0 I said, \u201cWe\u2019re building the Rolls Royce of walls.\u201d\nWe brought in border security.\u00a0 We brought in the Border Patrols.\u00a0 We went over there \u2014 I said, \u201cGive me yours A-list.\u00a0 I want every single thing, so when I build it, I build it right.\u201d\u00a0 What do I know about building walls?\u00a0 And they gave me every single thing.\u00a0 And I got every single thing, from the height; to the vision through; to the type of steel that can\u2019t be cut easily; to the type of concrete \u2014 5,000 pound, very strong concrete; to the type of rebar; to the anti-climb provision that we have on top.\u00a0 Anti-climb.\u00a0 Who knows about anti-climb provision?\nAnd we built and we\u2019re building a wall, and it is going up rapidly.\u00a0 And that is tough because I built it against every single Democrat who, four years ago, wanted it.\u00a0 And the only reason they don\u2019t want it now is because I want it.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s the only reason.\u00a0 Only one reason.\nAnd I said \u2014 you know, I said this the other day, first time \u2014 I said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it took me so long to figure this one out.\u201d\u00a0 If I would have said, \u201cI do not want the wall.\u00a0 I will not build the wall,\u201d they would have insisted on the wall.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\u00a0 It would have been so much easier.\u00a0 It would have been so much easier.\u00a0 Oh, Dana, it would have gone up so fast.\nBut I took money from here and there and here and military, because it is national security, okay?\u00a0 How about these people that said it was not national \u2014 when drugs are pouring in \u2014 human trafficking \u2014 women, mostly women \u2014 human trafficking \u2014 and children, but mostly women.\u00a0 And it\u2019s going up really fast.\nAnd, by the way, it is pretty much financed.\u00a0 It\u2019s really financed.\u00a0 And we may get some more.\u00a0 If we get some additional financing, we will extend it a little bit.\u00a0 But we should have \u2014 by the end of next year, we should have anywhere from 400 to 500 miles of wall built in the most important areas.\u00a0 That\u2019s exactly what we need.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTo protect national security, we\u2019re fully rebuilding and, for the most part, have fully rebuilt our military.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Because, as I say and I have said tonight, my first duty as President is the defense of our nation.\nAs a candidate, I promised to make fundamental changes to our foreign policy after years of deadly debacles and blunders under previous administrations.\u00a0 It has been pretty bad out there.\u00a0 We have the greatest soldiers in the world, but they had equipment that was depleted.\u00a0 It was old.\u00a0 We had jets that didn\u2019t fly \u2014 50 percent of our jets didn\u2019t fly.\u00a0 They\u2019d go to the plane graveyards out in the deserts, and they\u2019d take parts because they didn\u2019t make the parts anymore.\nAnd we\u2019ve now spent \u2014 think of this \u2014 $8 trillion in the Middle East.\u00a0 Thousands of American soldiers have lost their lives and tens of thousands more have been severely wounded.\u00a0 And the hardest thing I have to do as President \u2014 single hardest thing, by far \u2014 is sending letters to the families of our fallen heroes.\u00a0 It\u2019s is the worst \u2014 they come in with letters \u2014 three, four, five.\u00a0 And sometimes, I\u2019ll call the parents.\u00a0 It\u2019s the hardest thing I have been do.\nAnd sometimes, I go to Dover and I\u2019ll see the big, big incredible machines come in \u2014 the cargo planes.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll see them take those coffins off those planes.\u00a0 And I will see parents, and sisters, and wives, and brothers \u2014 families.\u00a0 I\u2019ll see families that \u2014 I\u2019ll meet them inside, and they will seem fine, sometimes.\u00a0 And I will say to the people that do it \u2014 they greet the dead.\u00a0 That\u2019s what they say \u2014 they greet the dead.\u00a0 They greet our heroes.\nBut I\u2019ll say to the people that do that \u2014 they\u2019re so professional.\u00a0 That\u2019s what they do.\u00a0 That\u2019s what they do every day.\u00a0 That\u2019s what they do.\u00a0 So professional.\u00a0 \u201cSir, you will stand here.\u00a0 You will then hear the drums.\u00a0 You will then hear the horns.\u00a0 You will this, you will that.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s like \u2014\nBut I\u2019ll go \u2014 Dover Air Force Base.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll see the parents and the wives and the husbands and whoever it may be.\u00a0 And oftentimes, I\u2019ll say to the colonel who\u2019s in charge, \u201cColonel, they\u2019re doing great.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo, sir.\u00a0 They\u2019re not.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cNo, I think they\u2019re really doing great.\u00a0 I had a great talk with them.\u00a0 They \u2014 they really are strong.\u00a0 It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cSir, they \u2014 they won\u2019t do great.\u201d\nI say, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019ll see in 20 minutes when the plane pulls up and the door opens up.\u201d\u00a0 That big, huge cargo door that\u2019s as big as this \u2014 much bigger than the back wall here.\u00a0 \u201cWhen you see that, sir, it\u2019s rare that bad things don\u2019t happen for those families.\u00a0 It\u2019s rare.\u201d\nI said, \u201cAll right.\u201d\u00a0 This is my first time, when I first came into office.\u00a0 And that big plane pulled up, and I had just spoken with the families.\u00a0 But that big plane pulled up.\u00a0 It\u2019s beautiful in its strength and power.\u00a0 And it pulled up, just arrived, and pulled \u2014 and it\u2019s sort of \u2014 we\u2019re all standing there \u2014 everybody, the military.\u00a0 And I\u2019m with generals and some Cabinet members, and the families are over here.\nAnd that tremendous door in the back, where they roll up the tanks and they roll up like unlimited amounts of equipment and weight \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t believe it is possible to fly with all of the things \u2014 you know, the power of those planes.\nAnd that door came down, and there\u2019s five soldiers on each side \u2014 beautiful soldiers, beautiful \u2014 and a coffin with a flag on it.\u00a0 And the same people \u2014 the same exact people that, 20 minutes ago, I was saying to the colonel, \u201cOh, they\u2019re doing great.\u00a0 But he was right.\u00a0 And that door opened, and you would hear screams and cries like you\u2019ve never heard before, actually.\u00a0 Like we\u2019ve never heard \u2014 like I\u2019ve never heard before.\nAnd the colonel explained to me, sometimes you\u2019ll see a mother or a wife \u2014 sometimes, he said, you\u2019ll see a sister break the line, break through the military, and run to the coffin and jump on top, as these incredible, strong, beautiful soldiers are carrying this coffin.\u00a0 Jump \u2014 and jump on top of the coffin.\u00a0 Just like, devastated.\u00a0 And they move as though nothing has happened.\u00a0 They just keep moving.\nAnd they take the body to where it\u2019s going.\u00a0 They place it in the hearse and it goes away.\u00a0 But I tell you, I\u2019ve never seen \u2014 you think this is easy.\nAnd we\u2019ve been in these wars now \u2014 one of them, 19 years.\u00a0 And they did not fight to win; they fight to just stay there.\u00a0 And, in Syria, we were supposed to be there for 30 days, and we\u2019ve been there for 10 years.\u00a0 And, these wars, they never end.\u00a0 And we have to bring our great soldiers back from the never-ending wars.\nI see \u2014 the other day I went \u2014 Friday, I went to Walter Reed Medical Center, the hospital.\u00a0 First of all, those doctors are incredible, what they can do.\u00a0 But I gave out Purple Hearts.\u00a0 And I see \u2014 in this case, young men \u2014 all men.\u00a0 And they have been just decimated.\u00a0 They step on a bomb \u2014 I mean, what\u2019s done to them is just incredible.\nSo, I see this.\u00a0 And I \u2014 you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a very hard thing to do.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t fight.\u00a0 We\u2019ll fight \u2014 we\u2019re fighting harder than anybody.\u00a0 But sometimes we have to know what we\u2019re fighting for.\u00a0 And we can\u2019t stay there forever.\u00a0 We have to bring our great heroes, our great soldiers \u2014 we have to bring them home.\u00a0 It\u2019s time.\u00a0 It\u2019s time.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd you know, in the case of Turkey and the Kurds \u2014 I could go into a whole story because I understand it, I think, better than most.\u00a0 But the Kurds were going to fight the Iraqis about a year and a half ago.\u00a0 Remember?\u00a0 And everybody said, \u201cWe have to fight with the Kurds.\u00a0 We have to fight\u2026\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cWell, wait a minute.\u00a0 We just spent $4 trillion on Iraq.\u00a0 Now, we\u2019re going to fight with the Kurds against Iraq?\u00a0 I\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d\u00a0 This was in a different part of Syria \u2014 totally different.\u00a0 They said, \u201cWell, the Kurds are going to fight, and they\u2019re going to fight.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be a horrible war.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cso we just spent $4 trillion fighting with Iraq,\u201d which, by the way, was the single worst mistake this country has ever made, going into the Middle East.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We\u2019re in there now for $8 trillion, thousands of our lives, and millions of lives on the other side, by the way.\u00a0 Millions.\u00a0 We\u2019re talking about millions and millions of lives.\nBut I said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to stand by.\u00a0 We\u2019re not going to choose sides.\u00a0 They\u2019ll have to go at it.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d\u00a0 The Kurds left.\u00a0 They left.\u00a0 And there was very little combat.\u00a0 And it was a great decision.\u00a0 We could have stayed and fought \u2014 fight the people that we\u2019d been fighting for, whether right or wrong.\u00a0 And we left, and we watched, and nothing happened.\nAnd people forget.\u00a0 Most people don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m talking about because it was a year and a half ago.\u00a0 And, even at the time \u2014 and nobody got credit for that correct decision.\u00a0 And now I\u2019m sort of an island of one again, but now it may be happening again.\u00a0 That 30 kilometers \u2014 about 22 miles strip along Turkey \u2014 and the Kurds are tending to leave and that\u2019s good.\u00a0 Let them have their borders.\nBut I don\u2019t think our soldiers should be there for the next 50 years guarding a border between Turkey and Syria when we can\u2019t guard our own borders at home.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think so.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo let\u2019s see what happens.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a long ways away.\u00a0 We killed ISIS.\u00a0 We defeated \u2014 we did our job.\u00a0 We have to go home.\u00a0 We did our job.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYou know the story: I went over to Iraq and they said, \u201cWe can do it, sir.\u201d\u00a0 They told me it was going to take a year to two years \u2014 my Washington generals.\u00a0 Highly overrated.\u00a0 He said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take one year to two years.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cMan, that\u2019s a long time.\u201d\nRemember I wanted to pull out, Dana?\u00a0 It was 97 percent.\u00a0 I wanted to go.\u00a0 I said, \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u00a0 Let\u2019s get out.\u201d\u00a0 I got \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t believe \u2014 the military industrial complex came down on me.\u00a0 So I wanted to get 100 percent.\u00a0 But it would take a year to two years.\u00a0 And then I went over and I met with the generals.\u00a0 I said, \u201cSo, Generals\u2026\u201d\u00a0 And these guys are like, I\u2019m telling you, central casting.\u00a0 Like better than anybody in Hollywood.\u00a0 There\u2019s nobody that looks like this in Hollywood.\u00a0 I said a couple of them looked better than Tom Cruise.\u00a0 They are just tougher and taller.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Better than Tom Cruise.\nBut I said, \u201cSo, General, let me ask you the big question.\u00a0 Let me ask you.\u00a0 They said it\u2019s going to take a year, maybe two.\u00a0 How long will it take you?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cTwo weeks, sir.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhat do you mean, two weeks?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYou can do it in two weeks, maybe a month \u2014 but two weeks, sir.\u201d \u201cHow do you do that?\u00a0 And why are they saying that you can do it in so much longer?\u201d\u00a0 And he said, \u201cSir, two weeks.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to hit them in the left.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to hit them on in the right.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to hit them underground, overground, this way, that way.\u00a0 They would never let us fight.\u201d\u00a0 But I said, \u201cBut I will.\u201d\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd they went in \u2014 and they did.\u00a0 They hit them on the left, they hit them on the right.\u00a0 They hit them down the middle.\u00a0 And within three weeks after I gave them the go-ahead, ISIS \u2014 we had 100 percent of ISIS.\u00a0 And we captured a lot.\u00a0 A lot were killed.\u00a0 They\u2019re fighters.\u00a0 They don\u2019t do big white flag things, you know.\u00a0 A lot of people said, \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll give up.\u201d\u00a0 And the General said, \u201cNo, they won\u2019t, sir.\u00a0 They don\u2019t give up.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s an ideology.\u00a0 And it, you know, a tough ideology.\nBut we did it very quickly.\u00a0 And so we \u2014 we did what we should have done.\u00a0 Most of these fighters came from Europe.\u00a0 They came from Germany.\u00a0 They came from France.\u00a0 They came from many countries in Europe.\u00a0 And I called them.\u00a0 I said, \u201cYou got to take back your fighters.\u201d\u00a0 They said, \u201cNope, we don\u2019t want them.\u201d\u00a0 And I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u00a0 We\u2019re not going to take the fighters.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want them.\u00a0 We\u2019re not bringing them to Guantanamo.\u00a0 We\u2019re not bringing them to our prisons in the United States.\u201d\u00a0 They come from France.\u00a0 They come from Germany.\u00a0 In many cases, they\u2019re citizens.\u00a0 They left to fight.\u00a0 \u201cWe don\u2019t want them back.\u201d\nI called them again.\u00a0 I said, \u201cYou have to take them back or I\u2019m going to let them go right on your damn border.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But they wouldn\u2019t do it.\u00a0 They wouldn\u2019t do it.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t want them back.\u00a0 We have thousands of them.\u00a0 We had some really bad ones.\nThe \u201cBeatles\u201d \u2014 you know the Beatles?\u00a0 They\u2019re the ones with the chopped off heads?\u00a0 And do you know what we did?\u00a0 The night that the war \u2014 that the shooting started, we had some incredible people go into that prison, and grab them, and bring them out, and we have them totally under wraps.\u00a0 They were the worst of everyone.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve got them now.\u00a0 They are ours.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut people don\u2019t treat us right.\u00a0 We did them a big favor.\u00a0 We captured these people.\u00a0 And I just want you to know that, because there\u2019s a big story to this; it\u2019s not just what these people say.\nAnd, by the way, if I did the opposite, if I had stayed and fought \u2014 we could have stayed and we could have fought, and we would have knocked Turkey around.\u00a0 And we would \u2014 they would have hated it.\u00a0 If I get out, they hate it.\u00a0 No matter what we do, they\u2019re going to hate it.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 No matter what decision we made \u2014 and if I\u2019m right, and if the Kurds do back up \u2014\nAnd we hope they do.\u00a0 I hope they do.\u00a0 Because it\u2019s very hard to beat to a force where they have planes, and they don\u2019t; where they have weapons that the Kurds don\u2019t have.\u00a0 We\u2019ve paid a lot of money to the Kurds over the years.\u00a0 And don\u2019t forget, they\u2019re fighting for their land.\u00a0 They haven\u2019t helped us fighting for our land.\u00a0 They\u2019re fighting for their land and that\u2019s good, but we\u2019ve helped them.\nBut no matter what we did, the media will say it\u2019s the wrong decision.\u00a0 I see it.\u00a0 It makes no difference.\u00a0 If I said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to stay and fight.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to fight them like they never saw,\u201d they\u2019ll say, \u201cIt\u2019s terrible.\u00a0 I told you he loves war.\u201d\nDon\u2019t forget, when I got elected, everybody thought that I\u2019d be in, Dana, World War Three the first day, right?\u00a0 Now they say, \u201cNot only aren\u2019t we, but we have the strongest economy in the history of our country.\u201d\u00a0 You know, it\u2019s pretty good.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd just so you know, wars and economies don\u2019t go well together, okay?\u00a0 You can check that out.\u00a0 So despite all of the blood that was spilled, the lives lost, and the money that was spent, the Middle East is right now \u2014 remember, and I say it.\u00a0 I\u2019ll say it: Going in was the worst decision.\u00a0 They went in for weapons of mass destruction, and there were none.\u00a0 There were none.\u00a0 That was the intelligence agencies.\u00a0 They\u2019re real \u2014 real beauties.\nIt\u2019s less safe now.\u00a0 It\u2019s less secure, less stable, and they fight.\u00a0 That is what they do; they fight.\u00a0 The generals came to me in Afghanistan.\u00a0 \u201cSir, it will be a rough spring.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhy?\u201d\u00a0 My first year.\u00a0 \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cWell, sir, the Taliban is going to come out of the mountains and they\u2019re going to start fighting.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cBut why do you say \u2018rough.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWell, that\u2019s what they do.\u00a0 They\u2019ve done this for 1,000 years.\u00a0 They come out in spring; they fight.\u00a0 That\u2019s what they do.\u00a0 They\u2019re very good.\u00a0 They\u2019re good fighters.\u00a0 That\u2019s what they do.\u201d\nYou know, Tony wants to go watch a football game.\u00a0 I want to go do things.\u00a0 They want to come out and fight.\u00a0 That\u2019s what they do.\u00a0 Right, Tony?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 They\u2019re probably a little bit tougher than Tony, but that\u2019s okay.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Just ask Russia if they\u2019re tough.\nWe can beat anybody.\u00a0 We can beat them easy.\u00a0 We\u2019re not fighting; we\u2019re policing in Afghanistan.\u00a0 But we\u2019ve been there 19 years.\nSo I just want you to understand these things.\u00a0 We\u2019ve to bring people back home.\u00a0 We\u2019re rebuilding our country.\u00a0 We\u2019re rebuilding our military.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want it depleted as fast as we build it.\u00a0 We have other problems.\u00a0 You have Russia.\u00a0 You have China.\u00a0 You have other big problems.\nI think we\u2019ll get along great with China.\u00a0 I think we\u2019ll get along great with Russia.\u00a0 But when they create a phony Russia hoax, it makes it tougher to get along with Russia.\u00a0 When they create lots of different scenarios with China, it makes it tougher to get along with China.\u00a0 I think we will do great, but they got to let us run our country the way it is supposed to be run.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo, these never-ending wars have increased, not decreased.\u00a0 And the grave danger posed to historic Christian communities has been incredible.\u00a0 Since the United States went to war in Iraq \u2014 now, listen to this.\u00a0 I was against going to the war.\u00a0 Nobody cared; I was a civilian.\u00a0 But I got a lot of publicity for whatever reason.\nThey always liked me, or hated me.\u00a0 No, I used to get the greatest publicity on Earth.\u00a0 That\u2019s how I\u2019m here.\u00a0 Once I announced I was going to run, they killed me.\u00a0 And then when I won \u2014 I said, \u201cYou know, great thing\u2026\u201d\u00a0 I told my wife, the First Lady \u2014 she\u2019s doing a great job.\u00a0 She\u2019s doing a great job.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 She really is.\u00a0 Man, (inaudible).\u00a0 If she were married to a liberal Democrat, they would say she may be the greatest in our world, but she\u2019s married to me.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut, you know, the first day \u2014 I won.\u00a0 It was historic.\u00a0 People didn\u2019t think \u2014 although a lot of \u2014 there were three polls that said we were going to win.\u00a0 I thought we were going to win because of the crowds we were getting, just like we got last night in Louisiana.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see what happens with that governor\u2019s race.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nJust like we got in a blue area of Minnesota.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re going to win Minnesota.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Group from Minnesota.\u00a0 Twenty-two thousand seats \u2014 it was like Madison Square Garden plus 1,000 seats.\u00a0 The Timberwolves arena, and \u2014 where they play the NBA games.\u00a0 And it was packed.\u00a0 And we could have sold it out four times.\u00a0 So some things happened.\nBut I said, \u201cWell, we won.\u201d\u00a0 You know, the great thing is \u2014 because the press was so dishonest during the campaign.\u00a0 So \u2014 like unbelievably.\u00a0 I said, \u201cYou know, do you know the great thing?\u201d\u00a0 I told it to my wife.\u00a0 I said, \u201cNow, they\u2019re going to respect what we did.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to get the great publicity for a while, like I used to get my whole life.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And it got worse.\u00a0 It\u2019s worse.\u00a0 It\u2019s not even close.\u00a0 It is worse now than ever.\u00a0 But that is okay, because, as I said to Time magazine, \u201cWe\u2019re here, and you\u2019re not.\u201d\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo, since the United States went to war in Iraq in 2003, the Christian community in the country has decreased by 80 percent, from roughly 1.5 million people to, right now, just 250,000 Christians in Iraq.\u00a0 You don\u2019t hear that.\nMy administration is absolutely committed to protecting religious minorities in the Middle East and all around the world.\u00a0 You know, if you were \u2014 (applause) \u2014 if you were a Christian in Syria, which was a rough place to be, you had almost no chance, during the last administration, of coming into the United States.\u00a0 It was, they say, the hardest thing to do to come into the United States \u2014 number-one most difficult place in the world to come in was if you were a Christian in Syria.\u00a0 If you were a Muslim in Syria, it was extremely easy to come into the United States.\u00a0 And the Christians were persecuted in Syria.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the way it is.\u00a0 But it\u2019s not that way anymore.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThis week, I directed $50 million to support Christians and other religious minorities in Syria.\u00a0 I did it on Friday \u2014 $50 million.\u00a0 I\u2019ll make it in honor of Pastor Brunson, Tony, Dana \u2014 some people that have done a great job for us.\u00a0 Fifty million dollars, and that\u2019s going to help Christians in Syria.\u00a0 Not an easy situation for them.\nIn total, my administration has provided more than a half a billion dollars in support of religious minorities and others suffering from atrocities in Syria and Iraq alone.\u00a0 Other Presidents would not be doing that.\u00a0 They\u2019d be spending a lot more money, but they\u2019d be spending it on things that would not make you very happy.\nWith one clear voice, the United States of America condemns the persecution of Christians.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And we pledge our support to Christian communities everywhere suffering under the brutal heel of oppression and violence.\u00a0 Our hearts and our souls are joined with these brave believers in their religious struggle.\u00a0 And, Pastor, it\u2019s great to have you back here.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI\u2019ve made clear to Turkey that if they do not meet their commitments, including the protection of religious minorities and also watching over the ISIS prisoners that we captured, we will impose a very swift, strong, and severe economic sanctions, like I did with respect to my negotiations to get Pastor Brunson out.\u00a0 Otherwise, I hate to say this, Pastor, you\u2019d still be there.\u00a0 And I hate to say this also, and this isn\u2019t done from ego: Any other President in the United States, you would still be there.\u00a0 You know what we had to do.\u00a0 And I have to say you were very brave the way you put up with it, but it wasn\u2019t an easy situation.\nAny military engagement where we send young men and women to fight and die must have clear objectives, vital national interests, and a realistic plan for how the conflict will end.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want to be in 19-year wars where we serve as a policing agent for the whole country.\nWe will continue our fight against the vile menace of radical Islamic terrorism.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 A lot of people don\u2019t want me to use that term.\u00a0 \u201cPresident, don\u2019t use that term.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cBut it\u2019s the truth.\u201d\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to use that term, but it\u2019s the truth.\nAnd we will never tire or waver in our defense of religious liberty.\u00a0 A few weeks ago, I was honored to be the first President to host a meeting at the United Nations to call upon all nations to end religious persecution.\u00a0 Can you imagine?\u00a0 The first President.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThe first President that did that \u2014 and can you imagine that?\u00a0 You would have thought that would be done every year for 40 years, wouldn\u2019t you?\u00a0 First President.\u00a0 And I read that, and it became a big story.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cCan you believe that\u2019s the first President that said we want to put an end to religious persecution?\u201d\u00a0 How can that be the first President?\u00a0 It\u2019s been there a long time, but that\u2019s the way it is.\nEarlier this year, I appointed a special envoy to monitor and combat the poison of anti-Semitism.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the Democrat party has invited anti-Semitism into its own ranks.\u00a0 Look at Omar.\u00a0 Look at her.\u00a0 Have you seen what she says \u2014 not only about our country, but look at what she says about Israel.\u00a0 And they\u2019re always making excuses.\u00a0 \u201cWell, she didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d\u00a0 She didn\u2019t mean it?\u00a0 Oh, she meant it.\u00a0 She meant it much more so than even her words.\nMy administration is confronting this scourge, and we\u2019re standing with our close friend and partner, the State of Israel.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And as you know very well, I recognized the eternal capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\nAnd we did it for the right price.\u00a0 Right, Tony?\u00a0 We got the building opened.\u00a0 You know, it\u2019s an interesting story.\u00a0 Some of you have heard it.\u00a0 We have a great ambassador, David Friedman. \u00a0But \u2014 great lawyers.\u00a0 He\u2019s one of the top lawyers in New York \u2014 made a lot of money.\u00a0 And he wanted to be the ambassador.\u00a0 But he wanted it and everybody wanted it.\nAnd every President has promised that for years and years.\u00a0 And they promise it.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re going to recognize the capital of Israel, and we\u2019re going to move the embassy to Jerusalem.\u201d\u00a0 But they didn\u2019t do it.\nI understand why because, once I got into office, you have no idea the pressure that was put on.\u00a0 Now, that was called a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d\u00a0 That was a quid pro quo.\u00a0 The pressure that was put on me by so many different countries.\u00a0 Calling, \u201cPlease don\u2019t do it.\u00a0 Please don\u2019t do it.\u201d\u00a0 The last two weeks, I didn\u2019t take anybody\u2019s phone call.\u00a0 I got calls from kings, you can imagine.\u00a0 I got calls from everybody not to do it.\u00a0 \u201cPlease don\u2019t do it.\u201d\nSo what I did is, I said, \u201cYou know what I\u2019ll do?\u00a0 I won\u2019t take their call.\u00a0 I\u2019ll call them back in a couple of weeks.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cDo me a favor.\u00a0 Tell the Prime Minister that I\u2019ll call him back in two weeks.\u00a0 I\u2019m busy.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 He said, \u201cTwo weeks? That\u2019s a long time.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cTell the king I\u2019ll call him back in a few days.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So, anyway \u2014 so I did it.\nAnd then I made all of those phone calls.\u00a0 It had a lot of publicity.\u00a0 And we did it.\u00a0 It was a big story.\u00a0 Nothing happened.\u00a0 Remember the world was going to come to an end, right?\u00a0 Nothing happened.\u00a0 I kept saying, \u201cAre we okay?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYeah.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cIs there a protest?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo.\u201d\nThree or four days went by.\u00a0 I said, \u201cWell, what\u2019s going on?\u00a0 This is strange.\u201d\u00a0 But then I started making the calls.\u00a0 I said, \u201cKing, what do you want?\u00a0 What\u2019s up, King?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And he goes, \u201cI wanted to call you to tell you that we would be very much opposed.\u201d\u00a0 And I said, \u201cOh, I wish I spoke to you sooner.\u00a0 Sorry.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It\u2019s true.\nAnd everybody is happy.\u00a0 Everybody is happy.\u00a0 Then we had to decide on a building.\u00a0 And they came in, one of the generals.\u00a0 \u201cSir, would you please sign this order?\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s it for?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re going to build \u2014 start the process\u201d \u2014 it would take 30 years, by the way \u2014 \u201cof building the embassy.\u201d\u00a0 The actual embassy.\n\u201cHow much is it?\u201d \u201cOne billion dollars, sir.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cWait a minute, this is a one-story building.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 That\u2019s what I do.\u00a0 How do you spend a billion?\u00a0 \u201cSir, we\u2019re going to purchase land, and then we\u2019re going to get approvals.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to\u2026\u201d\nI said, \u201cHow old are we going to be by the time this thing finishes, General?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know, sir, but it\u2019s $1 billion.\u201d\nI had the name \u201cDonald\u201d signed.\u00a0 \u201cDonald.\u201d\u00a0 Then I said, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u00a0 And they said \u2014 and I said \u2014 crossed it out.\nI called David Friedman.\u00a0 I said, \u201cDavid, go check Jerusalem.\u00a0 Do we own any land?\u201d\u00a0 He said, \u201cLet me check it out.\u201d\u00a0 He calls me back.\u00a0 He goes, \u201cSir, we do.\u00a0 We own a much better piece that the piece they want to buy.\u00a0 Much better.\u00a0 It\u2019s bigger.\u00a0 It\u2019s safer.\u00a0 It\u2019s a much better location with better views.\u00a0 And you know what?\u00a0 We have a building on it.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\nAnd he says, \u201cSir, I think we can renovate the building for $200,000.\u201d\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 True story.\u00a0 And it\u2019s the only time in my whole life that \u2014 you know, usually, I\u2019d say, \u201cMake it a hundred.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cDavid, it\u2019s too cheap.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t sound like enough.\u201d I said, \u201cMake it $500,000 or less.\u201d\nAnd we did.\u00a0 And we took this building, which was a very good building \u2014 set back.\u00a0 It had all the things that you need.\u00a0 They like set back, for safety.\u00a0 A big site.\u00a0 A beautiful site.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cDo me another favor.\u00a0 Use Jerusalem stone.\u201d\u00a0 Because a friend of mine in New York has \u2014 he\u2019s so proud.\u00a0 He uses Jerusalem stone in his office.\u00a0 He\u2019s a very rich guy.\u00a0 Ron Baron.\u00a0 He\u2019s got a wall of Jerusalem stone.\nEvery time I come in, he goes, \u201cOh, this is Jerusalem stone.\u201d\u00a0 And I say, \u201cRon, you\u2019ve told me that 100 times.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0\u00a0 He said, \u201cYou have no idea how expensive it is.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cListen, you\u2019re in Jerusalem.\u00a0 Can you get Jerusalem stone?\u201d\u00a0 He says, \u201cYeah, I can buy it real cheap.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Comes from Jerusalem.\u00a0 So they used Jerusalem stone, and we built it for less than $500,000.\nWe opened it in four months.\u00a0 That is better than the Wollman Rink story \u2014 you want to really know the truth.\u00a0 It\u2019s better.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 So instead of a billion and a half \u2014 don\u2019t forget, the billion was going to be $2 billion and $3 billion.\u00a0 I could tell you stories.\u00a0 But anyway, so we \u2014 not only did we get and do what we said I was going to do, but I got the building built and it\u2019s been open for a year and a half.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a beautiful, beautiful embassy.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd maybe someday, they\u2019ll build whatever they want to build, and they\u2019ll have a good time, and they\u2019ll waste a lot of money.\u00a0 But we\u2019ve got a beautiful building now that works beautifully.\u00a0 And it opened up a few months \u2014 so it\u2019s not just a designation.\nAnd we did another thing: We recognized \u2014 after 52 years of negotiation, I recognized the Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.\u00a0 That was a big deal.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 They\u2019d have meetings and meetings, and people would fly in.\nI withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And Iran is a much different country.\u00a0 They are misbehaving, but they got to be very careful when they misbehave.\nAnd here in the Western Hemisphere, we\u2019re standing against the horrors of communism and socialism \u2014 that\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting right here \u2014 and supporting the people of Cuba and Nicaragua and Venezuela in their noble quest for freedom.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019ll all happen.\nAnd tonight, I declare once again: America will never be a socialist country.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Never, never, never, never be.\u00a0 Our nation was not built by bureaucrats and regulators.\u00a0 America was built by families and pilgrims and pioneers.\u00a0 Our destiny is not written by people that come from areas of the world that know nothing about what we want to do.\u00a0 It\u2019s all written in our hearts.\u00a0 It\u2019s really written in our hearts.\nOur future will not be decided by the media, the bureaucrats, and the politicians. \u00a0It will be decided by all of you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 That\u2019s why we have elections.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we have elections.\nIn every generation, the faith of our people has spurred our nation to overcome every challenge to our values and to our way of life.\u00a0 It has inspired us to face down the worst evils, unlock the greatest mysteries, and achieve what no one thought was ever possible.\nNow, powered by those same historic values that have always defined our nation, we will reach new heights, make new breakthroughs, and we will strengthen the bonds of love and loyalty that unite us all as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots, as Christians, as people of faith.\nAs one people, one nation, and one United States of America, we will stand as a light of liberty, a land of courage, and a home for proud people of faith.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nForever and always, Americans will believe in the cause of freedom, the power of prayer, and the eternal glory of God.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 God bless you.\u00a0 And God bless America.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEND\n8:05 P.M.

EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So, we just made what, I guess, is one of the biggest deals that\u2019s been made in a long time, with China.\u00a0 The Vice Premier has just left my office.\u00a0 We have a great deal.\u00a0 We\u2019re papering it now.\u00a0 Over the next three or four or five weeks, hopefully it\u2019ll get finished.\u00a0 A tremendous benefit to our farmers, technology, and many other things \u2014 the banking industry, financial services.\nAnd, I guess, by now, you know pretty much we\u2019ve had a very, very good couple of days with China.\u00a0 And it looks like that deal is very much on it\u2019s on way.\u00a0 It\u2019ll be the largest deal ever made for farmers.\u00a0 We\u2019re talking about a $40 [billion] to $50 billion purchase and other things.\nI mean, it\u2019s an incredible deal for farmers.\u00a0 I think they\u2019ll have to go out and buy more land and buy bigger tractors.\u00a0 So, we\u2019ll hopefully get that done pretty quickly.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, you have \u2014 you have been bombed today.\u00a0 Our Special Forces were bombed by the Turks.\u00a0 Are we going to take sanctions against the Turks?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019ll take a look at it.\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a look at it.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 President Trump, sir.\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\u00a0 On the farmers, on that deal, is this a one-year deal or have they agreed to multi-year purchases in ag?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 This will go a long time into the future.\u00a0 This a buy.\u00a0 This is a very big buy.\u00a0 It\u2019s two years, but it\u2019ll go a long time into the future.\u00a0 The biggest deal made was $16 billion and this could be $50 [billion].\u00a0 So this is many times more, many times bigger than any deal ever made for the farmers.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And do you expect them to keep their word this time?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Say it.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you trust them to keep their word this time on the purchases?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Oh, they\u2019ll keep their word.\u00a0 China is going to keep their word.\u00a0 They want to make the deal.\u00a0 They\u2019re going to keep their word.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 President Trump, is Rudy Giuliani still your personal attorney?\u00a0 Is Rudy Giuliani still your personal attorney?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t spoken to Rudy.\u00a0 I spoke to him yesterday, briefly.\u00a0 He\u2019s a very good attorney, and he has been my attorney.\u00a0 Yeah, sure.\nSteve.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A question on China.\u00a0 Are you prepared to take Huawei off of the entity list in a later phase?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re looking at it.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t discuss that, Steve, on this deal \u2014 Huawei.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t discuss it, having to do with phase one.\u00a0 This is phase one of an either phase two or phase three deal.\u00a0 So we haven\u2019t discussed Huawei, relative to this deal.\nSo basically, the status will remain the same.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Until when?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On Maria Yovanovitch, sir.\u00a0 On Maria Yovanovitch \u2014 did you put pressure to have her fire the Ambassador to Ukraine \u2014 Yovanovitch?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, she may be a wonderful woman.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know her \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did you pressure them?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 but she may be very much a wonderful woman.\u00a0 If you remember the phone call I had with the President \u2014 the new President \u2014 he didn\u2019t speak favorably.\u00a0 But I just don\u2019t know her.\u00a0 She may be a wonderful woman.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the Chinese make lifting Huawei\u2019s restrictions \u2014 taking Huawei off the blacklist \u2014 a condition of the phase two deal, would you consider doing that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I\u2019m not going to talk about it now, because we\u2019re just starting the negotiation of phase two.\u00a0 We\u2019ll actually begin as soon as we\u2019re finished papering phase one.\nBut phase one, it\u2019s one of the biggest deals ever made \u2014 and unbelievable for technology, unbelievable for the banking industry and services, and for the farmers.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s never been anything like it.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What do you think about Huawei?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re going to see what happens.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be discussing that in phase two.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you want to fire the whistleblower?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Who?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you want to fire the whistleblower?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, the whistleblower has been very inaccurate.\u00a0 The whistleblower \u2014 I don\u2019t know what kind of a whistleblower \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then why don\u2019t you fire the whistleblower?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 The whistleblower reported a totally different conversation than I had.\u00a0 I released a transcript of my conversation \u2014 an exact transcript.\u00a0 And the whistleblower didn\u2019t say that.\u00a0 The whistleblower is either saying untruths, okay?\u00a0 Or he didn\u2019t know.\u00a0 Or he\u2019s making up a story, like Schiff did.\u00a0 Schiff made up a story.\u00a0 Because when Schiff read what I actually said, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t say this because he did nothing wrong.\u201d\u00a0 So Schiff went out and he made up a lie.\u00a0 He made up a \u2014 it was a fraudulent story.\u00a0 You know that.\u00a0 You know that better than anybody.\u00a0 You\u2019re a good lawyer.\nAnd, frankly, he went out.\u00a0 He made up a fraudulent story.\u00a0 He then went before the U.S. Congress and the American people, and he reported a fraudulent story.\u00a0 Now, Schiff \u2014 something should happen to Schiff for that.\u00a0 He shouldn\u2019t have immunity for that.\u00a0 Why should Schiff be given immunity when he goes out and he says a story about the President of the United States \u2014 what the President said \u2014 and it bears no relationship?\u00a0 In fact, every word was different.\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you what: I can\u2019t believe that a congressman could be that dishonest and can have immunity from that.\nSteve.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I just have a question about Turkey.\u00a0 Are you \u2014 how serious are you about being a mediator between the Kurds and the Turks?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So, Turkey and the Kurds have been fighting for hundreds of years.\u00a0 We are out of there.\u00a0 But we have a tremendous financial strength, which I\u2019ve helped a lot with, because our country has become much stronger since I\u2019ve been President, by many trillions of dollars.\u00a0 And if Turkey does something that they shouldn\u2019t be doing, we will put on sanctions the likes of which very few countries have ever seen before.\nDavid.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, did you or your administration pressure Fox News to get rid of Shepard Smith?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 Is he leaving?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He\u2019s leaving.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Oh, that\u2019s a shame.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then why did Bill Barr meet with Rupert Murdock the other night?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 Wait \u2014 did I hear Shepard Smith is leaving?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Is he leaving because of bad ratings?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You\u2019d have to ask him.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Tell me.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 He has terrible ratings.\u00a0 Is he leaving because of his ratings?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You have to ask him.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I mean, if he\u2019s leaving, I assume he is leaving because he had bad ratings.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But you didn\u2019t put any pressure on anybody?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 He had the worst ratings on Fox, so there\u2019s a reason \u2014 why is Shepard Smith leaving?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You\u2019d have to ask him, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I wish him well.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Attornery General \u2014 the Attorney General meeting with Rupert \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I wish \u2014 I wish Shepard Smith well.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, why haven\u2019t you asked your Justice Department to investigate Hunter Biden if he has acted so improperly?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think Hunter Biden is a disgrace.\u00a0 You know, the number-one T-shirt selling right now is, \u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter?\u201d\u00a0 I came up with that one last night.\u00a0 And, by the way, we had a record-setting \u2014 last night, as you saw \u2014 rally.\u00a0 That was a rally like few other rallies.\nAnd now I\u2019m going to Louisiana.\u00a0 And we\u2019re taking the Little League World Champions \u2014 I think World Champions.\u00a0 And they\u2019re going to be on the plane.\u00a0 They\u2019re from Louisiana.\u00a0 And they\u2019re flying with me.\u00a0 We just had pictures in the White House.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Will you ask your Justice Department to investigate Hunter Biden then?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I haven\u2019t asked that, no.\u00a0 But a lot of people should be asking, perhaps.\u00a0 I have not asked it.\nHunter Biden walked away with a billion and a half dollars from China, $168,000 a month from Ukraine \u2014 supposedly a $3 million payment from Ukraine.\u00a0 Have I asked?\u00a0 No.\u00a0 But I can\u2019t imagine that somebody isn\u2019t asking.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 President Trump, your letter to Nancy Pelosi does not seem to be working.\u00a0 Many people are testifying.\u00a0 Do you need a new legal strategy?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 The whole thing that they\u2019re doing is a hoax to try and win an election that they\u2019re not going to win in 2020.\u00a0 You look at the phone conversation I had with the President of Ukraine; it was perfect.\u00a0 The only thing that wasn\u2019t perfect was the fraud that was committed on the American people in Congress when Schiff got up.\u00a0 And instead of reading what was said, word-for-word, exact \u2014 when Schiff got up and he lied and he defrauded the American public by making up a conversation.\u00a0 He made it up.\nSo let me just tell you that the whole \u2014 this whole Ukraine story is a hoax.\u00a0 And yesterday \u2014 I know you don\u2019t like to report it, but I might as well say it: The President of Ukraine said loud and clear that the conversation was absolutely a perfect conversation, that there was no problem with it whatsoever.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, on Turkey, one detail \u2014 on Turkey, sir.\u00a0 You\u2019ve said many times the sanctions could kick in if Turkey does something they shouldn\u2019t do.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 The what?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What is the red line Turkey should not cross to avoid sanctions?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019ll see.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Like what?\u00a0 An example.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We\u2019ll see.\u00a0 We have a good relationship with Turkey.\u00a0 They\u2019re a NATO partner.\u00a0 We do a lot of trade with Turkey.\u00a0 But we don\u2019t want them killing a lot of people.\u00a0 And, you know, we have been out of there.\u00a0 We beat ISIS.\u00a0 We knocked the hell out of them.\u00a0 We took a hundred percent of the caliphate.\u00a0 We did our job.\nBut we have a lot of power, financially.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve built something here.\u00a0 Over the last three and a half years, if you take a look \u2014 take a look at what\u2019s been happening to the United States over the last almost three years.\u00a0 You take a look at the economic power that we\u2019ve created.\u00a0 We\u2019ve gone up \u2014 in fact, the Vice Premier of China just said \u2014 we\u2019ve gone up trillions of dollars.\u00a0 China has gone down trillions of dollars.\u00a0 If we have to use sanctions, we will on Turkey.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, why are you sending more troops to Saudi Arabia when you just said it\u2019s a mistake to be in the Middle East?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So we\u2019re sending more troops to Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 Saudi Arabia is a very good ally, from the standpoint that we get along with them very well \u2014 a very important player in the Middle East.\u00a0 The relationship has been very good.\u00a0 And they buy hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of merchandise from us, not only military equipment.\u00a0 In military equipment, about $110 billion.\u00a0 It\u2019s millions of jobs.\nNow, with that being said, we are sending troops and other things to the Middle East to help Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 But are you ready?\u00a0 Saudi Arabia, at my request, has agreed to pay us for everything we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 That\u2019s a first.\nBut Saudi Arabia \u2014 and other countries, too, now \u2014 but Saudi Arabia has agreed to pay us for everything we\u2019re doing to help them.\u00a0 And we appreciate that.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, about your tax returns.\u00a0 You lost in court today about your tax returns \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It\u2019s all right.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If Pelosi starts impeachment, will you still object?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three court losses today.\u00a0 Any \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Say it?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three court losses today.\u00a0 Any reaction to that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 What?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On immigration and taxes, turning over your taxes to \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We lost immigration?\u00a0 I haven\u2019t heard that.\u00a0 We\u2019ll win.\u00a0 We\u2019ll turn \u2014 we\u2019ll \u2014 you know how many cases I\u2019ve lost and then we win?\nOkay, remember they said I lost ban \u2014 the travel ban?\u00a0 And then they said I lost it again, and then I ended up winning it.\u00a0 So, I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve had a great \u2014 I\u2019ve had a great track record.\u00a0 And right now, within a couple of weeks, we will have 160 judges.\u00a0 And within a couple of months, we\u2019ll have 182 federal judges.\u00a0 And we are breaking records like nobody has ever seen in that regard, as you know.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you support administration officials \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Do you agree?\u00a0 Do you agree?\u00a0 A hundred and eighty-two.\u00a0 Do you agree?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you support administration officials \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You got to say yes.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 testifying under subpoena?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Your father would say yes.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You agreed to hold off on the tariff increase next week, correct?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We\u2019re going to hold off on the 5 percent increase from 25 to 30 [percent].\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And what specific concessions did you get from the Chinese in exchange for that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, if you look at the deal, the deal is so incredible.\u00a0 The deal is a great deal.\u00a0 And I have to say it again: The farmers \u2014 it\u2019s going to be $50 billion dollars\u2019 worth of purchase.\u00a0 The most they\u2019ve ever done was $16 [billion].\u00a0 So the farmers in Iowa, Nebraska, and all of these other great states that I love and that obviously like me a lot, too, they\u2019re going to have to buy more land fast and bigger tractors or they\u2019re not going to be able to keep up with the order.\nAlso, China, over the last two weeks, as you\u2019ve probably seen, has been buying a lot of farm product.\u00a0 A lot of farm product.\nSo, we\u2019re agreeing not to put that additional increase.\u00a0 So we\u2019re going to get 25 percent.\u00a0 And when the increase kicks in on October 15th, on the 25 to 30 [percent], we\u2019re not going to charge that.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to be held in abeyance, subject to the final deal.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any other concessions from the Chinese, other than agriculture?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, it\u2019s basically everything I said.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have to go through it.\u00a0 But tremendous for banking, tremendous for technology.\u00a0 Beyond tremendous for the American farmer and rancher.\u00a0 Tremendous deal.\nHave a good time.\u00a0 See you in Louisiana.\u00a0 We\u2019re going \u2014 we\u2019re going now \u2014 we\u2019re going now to Louisiana.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have a great rally.\u00a0 I hope you\u2019re going to come.\u00a0 Okay?\nEND\n4:59 P.M.

        "text": "Oval Office\n3:36 P.M. EDT\nPresident Trump and Vice Premier Liu He of China\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a lot of very big news and some very good news today.\u00a0 But I\u2019d like to hold this for China.\u00a0 There\u2019s nothing bigger than what we\u2019re doing with China.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s important that these are the questions that are asked.\u00a0 And, as you know, we have the Vice Premier of China, one of the most respected men in all of China, and the world, for that matter.\u00a0 And we have great respect for him, a great friendship with him.\nAnd we\u2019ve come to a very substantial phase one deal, and I\u2019ll go through some of the points, and then I\u2019ll ask the Vice Premier to say a few words and any comments that he may have.\nWe have come to a deal, pretty much, subject to getting it written.\u00a0 It\u2019ll take probably three weeks, four weeks, or five weeks.\u00a0 As you know, we\u2019re going to be in Chile together for a big summit.\u00a0 And maybe it\u2019ll be then, or maybe it\u2019ll be sometime around then.\nBut we\u2019ve come to a deal on intellectual property, financial services.\u00a0 A tremendous deal for the farmers.\u00a0 A purchase of \u2014 from 40 to 50 billion dollars\u2019 worth of agricultural products.\u00a0 To show you how big that is, that would be two and a half, three times what China had purchased at its highest point thus far.\u00a0 So, they were purchasing $16 or $17 billion at the highest point, and that\u2019ll be brought up to $40 billion to $50 billion.\u00a0 So I\u2019d suggest the farmers have to go and immediately buy more land and get bigger tractors.\u00a0 They\u2019ll be available at John Deere and a lot of other great distributors.\nBut we\u2019re taking the purchase of agricultural products from $40 to $50 billion, meaning in that neighborhood \u2014 from 40 to 50, approximately, billion.\u00a0 And what they\u2019ve been doing now, I believe, is about $8 billion, right?\u00a0 Eight \u2014 right now it\u2019s eight.\nThe other thing I will say is, over the last two weeks, a lot of purchases have started going back to our farmers.\u00a0 And you\u2019ve been doing a lot of business with us, which we appreciate very much.\u00a0 But it really started a few weeks ago, but they intend to go up, ultimately, once the agreement is signed, from $40 to $50 billion.\u00a0 And, really, from \u2014 that was from a base of probably $16 billion, and right now it\u2019s $8 billion.\u00a0 And the $8 billion was lower than $8 billion. \u00a0They got up to $8 billion because they\u2019ve been purchasing quite a bit over the last couple of weeks.\nSo, we also have the agricultural structural issues.\u00a0 We have some incredible progress on the structure and structural issues.\u00a0 And, Bob, perhaps you could discuss that, please, on agriculture, and explain the importance of the structural issues that we\u2019ve solved.\nAMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER:\u00a0 Well, I would say probably at least as important as the purchases is the fact that we\u2019ve corrected a variety of SPS \u2014 what we call sanitary and phytosanitary issues.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve corrected biotechnology issues.\u00a0 And it will be \u2014 it will be much easier now for American farmers to be able to ship to China.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve made some corrections on our side to \u2014 that will help them on the Chinese side.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 And that\u2019s been completed and pretty much done.\nAMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER:\u00a0 That\u2019s correct.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Another big issue that we\u2019ve come to conclusion on is currency, foreign exchange.\u00a0 And, Steve, do you want to explain that, please?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019ve had very good discussions with Governor Yi, head of the People\u2019s Bank of China \u2014 their central bank.\u00a0 We\u2019ve also had extensive discussions on financial services, opening up their markets to our financial services firms.\u00a0 So that we have pretty much almost a complete agreement on both those issues.\u00a0 And as you know, Mr. President, currency has been a very big concern of yours since the campaign.\u00a0 And we have an agreement around transparency into the foreign exchange markets and free markets.\u00a0 So we\u2019re very pleased with that.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 We\u2019ve also made very good progress on technology transfer, and we\u2019ll put some of technology transfer in phase one.\u00a0 Phase two will start negotiations almost immediately after we\u2019ve concluded phase one and papered it.\u00a0 And I think phase one should happen pretty quickly.\nSo you have intellectual property.\u00a0 We have an agreement on intellectual property.\u00a0 Financial services \u2014 the banks and all of the financial services companies will be very, very happy with what we\u2019ve been able to get.\u00a0 And I think China is going to be very happy because they\u2019ll be served very well by these great institutions being able to go into China.\u00a0 And it\u2019s going to be a tremendous thing for banks and for financial service companies.\nAgricultural structural issues \u2014 tremendous for the farmers.\u00a0 As Steve said, that\u2019s almost as good as \u2014 which I disagree with him on that, but it\u2019s almost as good as going from $8 billion and then to $16 billion, which was their all-time high, to $40 to $50 billion.\u00a0 So we\u2019re going to be up to 40 to 50 billion dollars of agricultural purchases, which means the farmers are going to have to work a lot of overtime to produce that much.\u00a0 That\u2019s the largest order in the history of agriculture, by far, by two and a half times.\nAnd technology transfer \u2014 we\u2019ll have some technology transfer in the agreement, but technology transfer will largely be done here and also in phase two. \u00a0So we\u2019re going to start negotiating phase two after phase one is completed and signed.\u00a0 And then there may be a phase three or we may get it done in phase two.\u00a0 So you\u2019ll either have two phases or three phases.\nSo we\u2019re very happy with it.\u00a0 We have great respect for China, great respect for President Xi.\u00a0 And I want to just tell you that I watched the 70th anniversary in great detail, and it was an incredible event.\u00a0 And congratulations on the 70th, everyone.\u00a0 That was really something very amazing to watch.\nMr. Lighthizer has done a terrific job.\u00a0 All of my team, I think, has done a fantastic job.\u00a0 The Vice Premier, I want to just thank you very much for being here with your team.\u00a0 You\u2019re very tough negotiators.\u00a0 Congratulations.\nBut it\u2019s something that we both realized right from the beginning is very important \u2014 not only for China and not only for the U.S., but for the world.\u00a0 And every time there\u2019s a little bad news, the market would go down incredibly.\u00a0 Every time there was a little bit of good news, the market would go up incredibly.\u00a0 And yet, other news that was also very big, the market just didn\u2019t really care.\u00a0 They just seemed to care about the deal with USA and China, and that\u2019s okay with me.\nSo we\u2019ve had a tremendous, really, negotiation, a very complex negotiation, but something that\u2019s going to be great for both countries.\nAnd, Mr. Vice Premier, would you like to say something?\nVICE PREMIER LIU:\u00a0 (As interpreted.)\u00a0 First, on behalf of the Chinese government, we would like to extend our thanks to President Trump for your congratulatory message to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nWe very much agree that to get the China-U.S. economic relationship right, it\u2019s something that is good for China, for the United States, and for the whole world, and we are making a lot of progress towards a positive direction.\nOver the recent days, I have had very good communication with both Ambassador Lighthizer and Secretary Mnuchin.\u00a0 And, Mr. President, as you just mentioned, we have made substantial progress in many fields.\u00a0 We are happy about it.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to make efforts.\nAnd thank you for this opportunity for me to speak up.\u00a0 And all my colleagues are happy about it.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a great honor.\u00a0 I think that the currency, foreign-exchange agreement that we made will be a tremendous \u2014 of tremendous benefit, both in terms of the magnitude of it and in terms of the simplicity of what we\u2019re able to do.\u00a0 It\u2019ll make a very complicated process much simpler.\u00a0 I think that, in itself, I just see as something that we both have been working for.\nYes, please.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:\u00a0 (Inaudible) read later to you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much.\u00a0 Could I see that?\u00a0 That would be very nice.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:\u00a0 Well, of course.\u00a0 Of course.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 That would be very nice.\u00a0 That\u2019s very nice.\n(The Vice Premier presents President Trump with a document.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Oh.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 That\u2019s \u2014 this is for guys like Jon that can\u2019t \u2014 that aren\u2019t good with Chinese.\nThey\u2019ll have that magnified so fast your head will spin.\nWell, it\u2019s a tremendous message, and thank you very much.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve read this, and I appreciate it very much.\u00a0 This is from President Xi.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 And we knew that we were going to have a very successful phase one.\u00a0 And it took us a long time to get here, but it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to be great for China and great for the USA, and we appreciate it very much.\u00a0 And please congratulate President Xi.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\u00a0 Mr. President, I just want to clarify on the tariffs \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Please.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\u00a0 So, I was just going to clarify, the Vice Premier has requested, and the President has approved, while we go through a process of documenting this, we will not be implementing the increase of tariffs that were scheduled to go in place from 25 to 30 percent.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ones that were supposed to go into place on Tuesday of next week, is that right?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\u00a0 That\u2019s correct.\u00a0 That\u2019s correct.\u00a0 Those will be confirmed while we \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Including the other ones.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, are we not closer to a complete end of this trade war?\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yeah, I think we\u2019re very close.\u00a0 I think this is a very important phase.\u00a0 A lot of things are \u2014 our agriculture will be completed because, when we bring it up to $50 billion \u2014 I project is going to be the number \u2014 I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a question as to whether or not our farmers can produce that much.\u00a0 And I think they can, but they\u2019re literally \u2014 and I said it jokingly, and I think I mean it \u2014 they\u2019re going to have to buy more land, which is okay.\u00a0 It would be a good time to own land in Iowa, Nebraska, and a lot of other great states.\u00a0 So, they\u2019re very happy about it.\nBut we\u2019re taking it from $8 billion, which it is now \u2014 and it was about $2 or $3 billion; they got down pretty low.\u00a0 But if you take \u2014 the highest it ever was was $16 billion, and we\u2019re bringing that to $50 billion.\u00a0 So we\u2019re going from 16 to 50 \u2014 so anywhere between 40 and 50.\u00a0 And that\u2019ll start very soon.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve actually already started purchasing.\u00a0 You\u2019ve actually started purchasing a lot \u2014\nVICE PREMIER LIU:\u00a0 Yes, yes.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 \u2014 from the farmers.\u00a0 We just got messages from the Midwest.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:\u00a0 We have already, what?\nPARTICIPANT:\u00a0 Twenty million.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:\u00a0 Twenty million tons.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 You have 20 billion?\nINTERPRETER:\u00a0 Twenty million.\u00a0 Twenty million tons of soybeans.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Oh, 20 million tons.\nPARTICIPANT:\u00a0 Of soybeans.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:\u00a0 Already.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yeah, a tremendous amount of soybeans.\u00a0 And that was over the last couple of weeks.\u00a0 We got word of that.\u00a0 You know, we got word.\u00a0 We notice it; it goes quickly \u2014 because we see a price go up a little bit, right?\u00a0 It\u2019s incredible the way the market works.\u00a0 But, yes \u2014\nVICE PREMIER LIU:\u00a0 About 398 dollars.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How will this deal be enforced, Mr. President?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 We\u2019re working on enforcement right now, and that\u2019s been largely agreed to, and that\u2019s one of the things in this agreement.\u00a0 We have an enforcement provision.\u00a0 And they\u2019re working out the final aspects of that enforcement position, and I think that\u2019s something \u2014 Bob, do you want to say something about that?\nAMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER:\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re going to have a very elaborate consultation process.\u00a0 We have an escalation in various areas so that difficulties can be resolved.\u00a0 Both parties have allocated \u2014 or have assigned various people; have created a structure under it.\u00a0 And we\u2019re down to the final details of what will happen if there\u2019s not a resolution.\u00a0 And that\u2019s, kind of, the final issue that we\u2019re putting together.\nBut both sides agree it absolutely has to have it, a workable dispute settlement mechanism.\u00a0 And we\u2019re very close to that.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, how do you see the U.S.-China relations right now?\u00a0 Do you see \u2014 what kind \u2014 what areas U.S. and China can still work together?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, I think they\u2019re great.\u00a0 I think the relationship, in certain ways, may be better than it\u2019s ever been.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been through a very tough negotiation.\u00a0 There\u2019s never been a negotiation like this.\u00a0 In all fairness, I give China tremendous credit because, for 25 or 30 years, they\u2019ve done very well with the U.S., and now we\u2019re doing something jointly.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing it in a fair manner.\nI give China credit for what they\u2019ve done over the last 30 years.\u00a0 Tremendous credit.\u00a0 I don\u2019t blame China; I blame the people representing our country.\u00a0 Now we have a deal that I think ultimately is going to be just fantastic for China and fantastic for the United States.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, can you clarify: Is this an actual deal or is this progress towards a deal?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 No, it\u2019s subject to getting everything papered.\u00a0 You have to do it \u2014 we\u2019ve agreed in principle to just about everything I mentioned, all of the different points.\u00a0 And now we\u2019re getting it papered, and I don\u2019t think it should be a problem getting it papered.\u00a0 I think that China wants it badly, and so we want it also.\u00a0 And we should be able to get that done over the next four weeks.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be in Chile in five weeks, so we\u2019ll see, in terms of signing, when it happens.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do a formal signing with President Xi and myself.\nBut this is just something that\u2019s very exciting.\u00a0 And I\u2019m very excited, actually.\u00a0 We cover a lot more territory than agriculture, but I\u2019m very excited for the farmer because this is \u2014 there\u2019s never been a deal of this magnitude for the American farmer.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On Huawei?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Bob, do you want to talk about the Huawei?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is Huawei in the deal, Ambassador Lighthizer?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Or Secretary Ross?\nAMBASSSADOR LIGHTHIZER:\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry, the question is \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Huawei.\nAMBASSSADOR LIGHTHIZER:\u00a0 In this agreement, we\u2019re not dealing specifically with Huawei.\u00a0 It\u2019s not part of this agreement.\u00a0 That\u2019s a separate process.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, have you or your advisors raised the business dealings of Hunter Biden with Chinese officials in the last week?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re going to discuss where\u2019s Hunter.\u00a0 Where is Hunter, by the way?\u00a0 Whatever happened to him?\u00a0 We\u2019re going to discuss where\u2019s Hunter when I get out because I\u2019ll stop at the helicopter.\u00a0 But, right now, in respect to China and to the Vice Premier, we\u2019re going to only ask questions about today.\nJon.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, on that point, can you assure that American people that you did not bring up Joe Biden in these negotiations; that you have not brought up that with the Chinese?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I have not brought up Joe Biden.\u00a0 China can do whatever they want with respect to the Bidens.\u00a0 China can do whatever they want with respect to $1.5 billion going to somebody.\u00a0 That\u2019s up to China.\u00a0 But we do have to look into corruption.\u00a0 But, no, it has not been brought up.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, how do you assure the American people that this deal, over the next three, four, five weeks, won\u2019t fall apart as it\u2019s being papered?\u00a0 And then, secondly, that phase two can \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, anything can happen.\u00a0 That can happen.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it will.\u00a0 I think we know each other very well.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been negotiating this for a long time.\u00a0 There\u2019s a possibility, of course, that maybe there\u2019s something that they\u2019re unable to get papered.\u00a0 But I\u2019ve been doing this for a long time.\u00a0 And the Vice Premier has been doing it for a long time, in many other deals for many, many years \u2014\u00a0 both of us.\nAnd his people are very profess- \u2014 great professionals, and so am I.\u00a0 And I think the likelihood of it falling apart is not so good.\nWhat do you think, Steve?\u00a0 What would you say?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\u00a0 I think we have a fundamental understanding on the key issues.\u00a0 We\u2019ve gone through a significant amount of paper, but there is more work to do.\u00a0 And we will not sign an agreement unless we get and can tell the President that this is on paper.\u00a0 And I know the Vice Premier needs to go back and do some work with his team, but we\u2019ve \u2014 we\u2019ve made a lot of progress over the last two days.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And most of this is also known by the people in China, by President Xi.\u00a0 He\u2019s been following it very closely, and (inaudible).\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Your teams have been working together for over a year and a half now.\u00a0 Can you comment on the progress \u2014 I mean the performances of the teams, of both sides?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I think \u2014 are you from China?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 China (inaudible).\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think the people of China have to be very proud of your team.\u00a0 They are unrelenting.\u00a0 I say that in a positive way.\u00a0 But they\u2019re unrelenting.\u00a0 They\u2019re tough.\u00a0 They\u2019re smart.\u00a0 And they have negotiated a great deal.\nBut I think the people of China should be very proud of this team, starting with the Vice Premier.\u00a0 He\u2019s a very extraordinary man, and we\u2019ve gotten to know each other well.\u00a0 And everybody on my team respects your team.\u00a0 So, I think they\u2019ve really handled themselves incredibly well.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, (inaudible) tariffs, sir \u2014 are the December tariffs also suspended as this process goes on?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So the tariffs on the increase from 25 percent to 30 percent, that will be suspended.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be paying 25, but we\u2019re not increasing it to 30.\u00a0 And then you might want to mention the additional tariff.\nAMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER:\u00a0 The addition \u2014 the additional tariffs are scheduled to go into effect, as many of you know, the second half of the September.\u00a0 That is scheduled into effect on December the 15th.\u00a0 And the President has not made a final decision on that, but there\u2019s plenty of time to make that decision.\u00a0 And that is certainly a part of this process that the Chinese are working their way through.\nSo, the first one has been suspended.\u00a0 The second one is subject to the President making a final decision.\u00a0 But, the way this timing works out, that will be well in advance of that date.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, when can students who are (inaudible) in this country \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Say it?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 that have difficul- \u2014 I mean, many Chinese students have difficulty in this country with their visas.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Students?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Chinese students in this country.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, no, no, no, no, no.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can you clarify to us \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be very good to Chinese students.\u00a0 Nope.\u00a0 I\u2019ve heard this question many times before, including from our own security people.\u00a0 We want all the people that want to come over from China.\u00a0 We have the greatest university system in the world, and we\u2019re going to keep it that way.\u00a0\u00a0 And one of the reasons it\u2019s great is we have a lot of students from China.\nNo, we\u2019re not going to make it tough.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to make it like for everybody else.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 We\u2019re going to make it \u2014 I think that\u2019s important.\nI think, Steve, I think it\u2019s very important, Bob, our universities are available.\u00a0 The world comes in.\u00a0 They use our universities.\u00a0 We have the greatest system in the world.\u00a0 And China is not going to be treated any differently.\nI think it\u2019s important for you to say that, too, to the people of China.\u00a0 Our system is open.\u00a0 People get in based on merit.\u00a0 We have incredible talent coming in from China.\u00a0 They occupy a big space in our universities, and we want to keep it that way.\u00a0 Okay?\nBecause there was a false \u2014 there was false rumors going on that we were going to close the schools to China.\u00a0 That is so false.\u00a0 It\u2019s just false.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:\u00a0 Some Chinese (inaudible) already exchanged our opinion.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You\u2019ve already exchanged.\u00a0 Yes.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:\u00a0 With (inaudible).\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, any chance of \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Wait, one second.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\u00a0 Mr. President, I think you\u2019ve been very clear in your directive all along, through the trade negotiations, on your view on the universities.\u00a0 And we will follow up.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you going to do anything to reassure the students?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 I can give them my word.\u00a0 I want them coming here.\u00a0 We want the greatest talent in the world coming to our great universities \u2014 to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, the great Wharton School of Finance \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 to Stanford, all of these great schools.\u00a0 We want them \u2014 we want them coming here.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we have.\u00a0 And that\u2019s one of the reasons we have the great system.\nAnd there have been discussing about that \u2014 not by me, because I ended them very quickly.\u00a0 I want to let you know, I end those discussions very quickly.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Inaudible) rescinding the currency manipulation designation?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\u00a0 We\u2019ll be making a decision on that and evaluating it.\u00a0 Although I would comment that, assuming we close the agreement and we have the assurances, that will be a big step in the right direction for our evaluation.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What about Chinese business?\u00a0 Do you still welcome Chinese business to invest in the U.S.?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Absolutely we do.\u00a0\u00a0 We do.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing a lot of business with Chinese companies.\u00a0 We do have to be \u2014 you know, security companies and certain companies \u2014 we have to be careful with and we have to pay very close attention.\u00a0 But we\u2019re doing tremendous business with China and with Chinese businesses.\nIt\u2019s tailed off.\u00a0 We\u2019ve tailed it off.\u00a0 We\u2019ve purposefully tailed it off.\u00a0 But that\u2019ll start building up very quickly again.\u00a0 We expect that to build up to a much bigger extent, I think, than even before.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When you\u2019ve talked about a big trade deal with China, is this what you\u2019ve envisioned?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, this is phase one, and it\u2019s a big part of it.\u00a0 The farmers, the intellectual property \u2014 a lot of \u2014 a lot of areas are covered here that, frankly, are in great shape \u2014 intellectual property.\u00a0 Financial services is going to be a massive boon to the banks and credit card companies and all of these companies, including ownership interests.\nYou know, before you had to do certain things that made it very difficult for banks and institutions to really go into China.\u00a0 China has really been opened up now, for the first time, to financial services and to the big banks and credit card companies and other types of financial services.\u00a0 So that\u2019s a tremendous thing.\u00a0 And I think we have complete agreement on that.\nIntellectual property \u2014 a lot of agreement.\u00a0 But we\u2019ll have some of that included in phase two.\nAgriculture should be done.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think the farmers can handle any more than what they\u2019re getting.\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget: We just signed a big deal with Japan.\u00a0 And that was a very big deal.\u00a0 And a lot of that had to do with agriculture also.\u00a0 So the farmers are doing well.\nIn currency, foreign exchange \u2014 we\u2019re all set on that.\u00a0 That we\u2019ve been able to do.\u00a0 And not only through simplification, but the importance of it \u2014 it\u2019s very important.\nAnd technology transfer \u2014 so we\u2019re going to have some technology transfer here, and some will be in phase two.\u00a0 We think we\u2019ll probably be able to conclude it with phase two, but it may be phase two, phase three.\u00a0 Okay?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, how did you come around to the idea of doing a phase one?\u00a0 You\u2019ve been saying, as recently as earlier this week, that you wanted one big deal.\u00a0 What changed your mind?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Because it\u2019s such a big deal and it covers so much territory that doing it in sections and phases is, I think, really better.\u00a0 And we\u2019re talking about very big \u2014 don\u2019t forget, we\u2019ve covered, fully, agriculture \u2014 even in terms of agricultural structural issues, and then in terms of $50 billion of agriculture.\nSo that will be covered in its entirety.\u00a0 Currency foreign exchange will be covered in entirety.\u00a0 Financial services, I think, will be covered pretty much in its entirety.\u00a0 So the banks and lending institutions \u2014 all institutions \u2014 are covered.\nSome of technology transfer, a large part of intellectual property will be covered.\u00a0 So I think it actually works out to be a very neat package.\u00a0 And now we can focus on phase two.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, how much time are you going to allow to go by as this goes through?\u00a0 So you said it might take four or five or six weeks to put it in paper.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Whatever it is.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At what point would you raise tariffs again if you don\u2019t have a deal that you can actually sign?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 Only \u2014 only good faith and faith.\u00a0 And I think we have a lot of good faith right now going on.\u00a0 I think we have \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So no new tariffs in the foreseeable future?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re going to start, Jon, right away, in getting this papered.\u00a0 Right now it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s already partially papered.\u00a0 Much of this has been pretty much completed, from the standpoint of paper.\u00a0 But we think it\u2019ll take four weeks, five weeks \u2014 something like that.\u00a0 Now, we happen to be together in Chile.\u00a0 So that could be a point, or maybe not.\u00a0 President Xi will be there and I\u2019ll be there for the big summit.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, the last time the Vice Premier was in the Oval Office, in April, you said a deal, at that point, was about four weeks away.\u00a0 I would love to hear from both of you why this time is different?\u00a0 What\u2019s changed in the relationship?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I think we got to know each other a lot better.\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget, there\u2019s been a lot of back-and-forth since that happened.\u00a0 We thought we had a deal, and perhaps they didn\u2019t, but it didn\u2019t work out that way.\u00a0 This deal is a bigger deal than the last deal, relatively speaking.\u00a0 Now, we\u2019re talking about big parts of it, with financial services and agriculture.\nBut when we talk about $50 billion in agriculture, we never had that in mind in the first deal.\u00a0 We were thinking about $20 [billion].\u00a0 We were thinking about anywhere from $16 [billion], I would say, to $20 billion.\u00a0 Now we\u2019re talking about $50 billion.\nSo this is actually a much bigger deal.\u00a0 It\u2019s a big chunk of it, but it\u2019s a much bigger deal than we had in mind \u2014 certainly, in terms of \u2014 I would say, Steve \u2014 financial services is bigger and more complete.\u00a0 Intellectual property will be in both phases of the deal.\u00a0 Currency foreign exchange \u2014 we didn\u2019t really discuss that very much in the last deal; now we\u2019re including it in this deal because a lot of things have happened during the course of the last year (inaudible).\u00a0 So \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I thought that was agreed in the spring.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I think this is actually, when you add it up, going to be a more important deal \u2014 a bigger deal.\u00a0 And more precise.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So the (inaudible) on currency had been agreed last spring as well, before talks broke down, right?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, now we have currency \u2014 the currency foreign exchange is included.\u00a0 The foreign exchange aspect of it is much more complete now than it would have been under the other system.\u00a0 And don\u2019t forget, a lot of things have happened with currency and foreign exchange that we weren\u2019t talking about a year ago.\u00a0 Things have happened.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the summit \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 From China.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You mentioned about the summit.\u00a0 When and where would you like it to be?\u00a0 And also \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re going to find that out.\u00a0 That\u2019ll be up to the Vice Premier and to President Xi.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll find that out.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 On the global economic slowdown, do you think this kind of win-win will help the global economy?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, the United States has been doing very well. \u00a0China, I think, will \u2014 I think this will be a tremendously positive \u2014 this is going to be a tremendous thing for China.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been doing well and I think we\u2019ll do better.\u00a0 I mean, we\u2019ve been doing really well.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been leading the world in many aspects of what we\u2019re talking about.\u00a0 I think we\u2019ll do even better.\u00a0 And I think China will do tremendously well with this deal.\u00a0 This is a great deal for China.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great deal for us.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This $40 [billion] to $50 billion \u2014 is that an annual figure?\u00a0 Will it rise to that figure?\u00a0 Is that over two or three years?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Do you want to define that, please?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\u00a0 It will scale up to an annual figure.\u00a0 Yes.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To an annual figure of $40 [billion] to $50 billion?\nSECRETART MNUCHIN:\u00a0 Yes.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can you say over how long, Mr. Secretary?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\u00a0 Within the second year.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Over the \u2014 over the \u2014 less than two years.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, did Hong Kong and the Uyghurs come up at all?\u00a0 That\u2019s a big issue in other parts of \u2014 on Capitol Hill, for example.\u00a0 Or is that separate to trade to you?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 We discussed Hong Kong.\u00a0 And I think great progress has been made by China in Hong Kong.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve been watching.\u00a0 And I actually told the Vice Premier it really has toned down a lot from the initial days of a number of months ago, when I saw a lot of people.\u00a0 And I see far fewer now.\nWe were discussing it, and I think that\u2019s going to take care of itself.\u00a0 I actually think this deal is a great deal for the people of Hong Kong to see what happened.\u00a0 I think this is a very positive thing for Hong Kong.\nBut \u2014 but it really has \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 the escalation, it really has deescalated a lot from the beginning, and we were discussing that.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Would you put a stop on the blacklist of Chinese companies, which seems to be expanding these days?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019ll be looking at the blacklist, and we\u2019ll be making a determination as to which companies would be on that list.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, if this deal goes forward \u2014 helps the economy, economic growth, et cetera \u2014 do you still think that the Federal Reserve needs to cut rates?\u00a0 And if so, by how much?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yeah, I do.\u00a0 I do.\u00a0 I think the Federal Reserve should cut rates regardless of this deal because we\u2019re higher than other nations.\u00a0 Germany is loaning money, and when it has to be paid back, they get paid, okay?\u00a0 It\u2019s ridiculous.\nAnd I think that the Federal Reserve should cut rates regardless of how good this is.\u00a0 We have a great economy, but we have a Federal Reserve that\u2019s not in step with the rest of the world.\u00a0 So I think they ought to get in step.\u00a0 And if they were in step, we\u2019d \u2014 we would \u2014 regardless of the China deal \u2014 the China deal is much more important than the interest rates, but \u2014\nBecause this has to do with more than trade; this has to do with world peace.\u00a0 This has to do with getting along.\u00a0 This has to do with the rest of the world.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t just a deal on trade.\u00a0 This has to do with a lot of friction, a lot of bad things that are happening in the world.\nSo, this is far more important than the Federal Reserve and interest rates.\u00a0 But the Federal Reserve should cut interests rates.\u00a0 Absolutely.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did you tell them anything about the impeachment process and how that might affect your ability to complete this deal?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I think it\u2019s helped me, because yesterday we had the biggest crowd.\u00a0 We broke a stadium record.\u00a0 We broke the record in Minnesota.\u00a0 Nobody has ever seen anything like that.\u00a0 And you saw it, and you understand it, too.\u00a0 And my poll numbers are going way up.\u00a0 And so, the impeachment, it\u2019s a hoax.\nNo, we didn\u2019t discuss it, but I would tell him it\u2019s a hoax.\u00a0 It\u2019s a hoax done by people that are losing.\u00a0 And they want to try and use it to try and win an election, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t think China believes it\u2019s going to happen, because if they did, they\u2019d rather deal with a Sleepy Joe Biden, who is failing badly.\u00a0 He\u2019s not going to make it anyway.\u00a0 But whoever does emerge on the other side, they\u2019d probably be better off maybe waiting.\nBut they also know that when I win, the deal gets even tougher.\u00a0 It gets even tougher.\u00a0 And they expect that I\u2019m going to win, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t sign the deal.\u00a0 It\u2019s very simple.\nNext.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, you\u2019ve made clear that you like putting tariffs out.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I do like tariffs.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How are you \u2014 what\u2019s your inclination then, about December?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think then we\u2019re going to have a deal that\u2019s a great deal, that\u2019s beyond tariffs.\u00a0 This is a deal that\u2019s a very important deal for China, a very important deal for the world, a very important deal for the United States.\u00a0 I think this is a deal that is beyond tariffs.\nI really mean that.\u00a0 I think that world peace \u2014 you know, there was a lot of friction between the United States and China.\u00a0 And now, it\u2019s a lovefest.\u00a0 That\u2019s a good thing.\u00a0 But that\u2019s good for China and it\u2019s good for us, but it\u2019s good for the world.\nThe Vice Premier said the same thing.\u00a0 And he said it better than anybody could have said it.\u00a0 He said, \u201cThis is a great thing for the world.\u201d\u00a0 He didn\u2019t say \u201cChina\u201d or \u201cus\u201d; he said this is a great thing \u201cfor the world.\u201d\u00a0 And he\u2019s absolutely right.\nPerhaps you\u2019d like to comment on that.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:\u00a0 Yes, I fully agree with you.\u00a0 It\u2019s good for China.\u00a0 It\u2019s good for U.S.\u00a0 But it\u2019s good \u2014 also good for the whole world.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 The whole world is watching.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Whole world is watching.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And it is amazing, and I say \u2014\nVICE PREMIER LIU:\u00a0 Not only (inaudible).\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yes.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:\u00a0 Not only a treaty.\u00a0 It provides peace and prosperity and development for the whole world.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s very important.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 He said, \u201cpeace and prosperity\u2026 for the whole world.\u201d\nSo, it\u2019s beyond the trade deal.\u00a0 It really is.\u00a0 And, you know, talk was getting tough, rhetoric was getting tough.\u00a0 We have ships and they have ships, and we have planes and they have planes.\u00a0 And, you know, bad things could happen.\u00a0 Stupid things could happen.\u00a0 But this is a great \u2014 a great thing that\u2019s taken place.\u00a0 We have a very good bond and relationship.\nAnd I have very little doubt that we\u2019ll be able to get this thing finalized now.\u00a0 It\u2019s not overly complex.\u00a0 And then they\u2019ll start phase two.\u00a0 But this was a very important deal for a lot of reasons.\nThank you very much.\u00a0 I hear a helicopter.\u00a0 I hear a\u00a0helicopter.\nI\u2019m going down to Louisiana.\u00a0 We have a totally sold-out crowd in Louisiana.\u00a0 And hopefully the governor of Louisiana, who is not doing a very go- \u2014 you know, he\u2019s not doing a very good job in Louisiana.\u00a0 Hopefully, he won\u2019t get the 50 percent, we\u2019ll have a runoff, and you have a nice, new Republican governor of Louisiana.\nAnd I hope a lot of you are going to join us.\u00a0 You\u2019re joining us, Jon?\u00a0 You\u2019re going to be joining us to Louisiana?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019ll be watching, sir.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be watching.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Did you watch last night?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Did you enjoy it?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You know, it\u2019s my job to watch.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 A lot of people enjoyed it, Jon.\u00a0 Have a good time everybody.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Would you take Huawei off the blacklist, sir?\u00a0 Would you take Huawei off the blacklist, possibly?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I \u2014 I \u2014 we\u2019ll talk about that later.\nEND\u00a0

There\u2019s somebody else who I promise you has never stopped fighting to create jobs, a more prosperous and a more secure America.\u00a0 So, Minnesota, before he\u2019s wheels down, let me bring greetings to Safety Signs from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYou know, I know Sue and Jay will appreciate this comment the President said not long ago: \u201cSmall-business owners embody the American pioneering spirit and remind us that determination can turn aspiration into achievement.\u201d\u00a0 And that really is the story.\u00a0 That\u2019s the story of the Blanchard family and of Safety Signs.\u00a0 And these are two people who have built a great business.\u00a0 I\u2019m looking out on a lot of great employees here.\u00a0 And give yourselves a round of applause.\u00a0 The success of this company is owing to each and every one of you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut, you know, this isn\u2019t just a great employer, it isn\u2019t just a great small business.\u00a0 It\u2019s also a great \u2014 a great corporate citizen.\u00a0 And these are \u2014 these are two great, proud graduates of St. Cloud State University.\u00a0 But, in 2016, I\u2019m actually told, they were named Lakeville Chamber of Commerce Community Business Partners of the Year for everything that they have done to improve this community \u2014 from the 9/11 Never Forget Memorial, to the VFW mobile Vietnam Wall.\u00a0 And all other community organizations, thank you for making Safety Signs and your family such a part of what makes this community special.\u00a0 We\u2019re really proud of you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, Sue.\u00a0 Great job.\u00a0 Really great job.\nAnd I know it\u2019s a family affair.\u00a0 Jay just made the point that I grew up in a small business in southern Indiana, south of Highway 40.\u00a0 We had a gas station business.\u00a0 Had three brothers and two sisters, and so I know what it is to be in a family business.\u00a0 So I don\u2019t want to \u2014 I don\u2019t want to miss mentioning your three kids: Isabel, Jake, and your oldest daughter, Karlee.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re here with us today, but give us a wave over here.\u00a0 Let\u2019s hear it for this great family.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And especially Karlee, who had the good sense to graduate from Notre Dame University in Indiana.\u00a0 Well done, Karlee.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI actually had the privilege of speaking at her commencement that year.\u00a0 And what a great accomplishment.\u00a0 I know your parents are so \u2014 so, so proud of each and every one of you.\nNow, we \u2014 we\u2019re gathering in a place that has a motto: \u201cWhatever it takes.\u201d\u00a0 I know you all live by that every day.\u00a0 You\u2019re working on tighter and tighter deadlines because Safety Signs is getting busier every day in this bustling economy.\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you what: I couldn\u2019t be more proud to serve alongside a president who, from the first day of this administration, has been working to get the economy of Minnesota moving and the economy of America moving.\u00a0 And right out of the gate, we cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses just like this one, family farmers.\u00a0 We rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in American history already.\u00a0\u00a0 And as you all see happening right here in northern Minnesota, we\u2019ve unleashed American energy.\u00a0 We have an energy revolution happening all across this nation, and the results have been amazing.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThe results have truly been amazing.\u00a0 The economy \u2014 as a Secretary just told you \u2014 more than 6 million new jobs in the last three years.\u00a0 Unemployment is at a 50-year low.\u00a0 There\u2019s more Americans working today than ever before.\nBut I\u2019ll tell you what: What actually means the most to the President and me \u2014 and I\u2019ll say this to Jay and Sue \u2014 is that wages are rising all across America in the last two years, and they\u2019re rising most rapidly for hardworking blue-collar Americans.\u00a0 The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more.\u00a0 This economy is working.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s working for working people.\nBut I came here today, with the support of this great trade work script, to tell you that, in addition, we think to let people keep more of what they earn and making sure you don\u2019t have a lot of red tape on your business so you can grow and thrive, and making sure that \u2014 making sure that we have a pathway to energy independence has been the President\u2019s ambition to promote trade deals that are free and fair.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve opened up new markets.\u00a0 Just about two weeks ago, we signed a new trade deal with Japan where we\u2019re going to \u2014 we\u2019re going to export more agricultural goods to Japan than ever before.\u00a0 We\u2019ve opened up markets in South America.\u00a0 We renegotiated the South Korea trade agreement.\nBut sitting on the desk of the Speaker of the House in Washington, D.C., is the largest trade deal in American history.\u00a0 And I came here to Minnesota today to say the time has come for Democrats in Congress to pass the USMCA, and pass it this year.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI mean, I don\u2019t have to tell all of you that trade means jobs here in Minnesota.\u00a0 In fact, we got someone with us today who, during his time in Congress, was a great, great champion of economic growth and low taxes, and free and fair trade.\u00a0 Jason Lewis, thank you so much for being with us today \u2014 you and your wonderful wife, Leigh.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut I want to challenge each one of you because we\u2019ve got a great opportunity in front of us.\u00a0 And Washington, D.C. is spending its time on the endless investigations and controversy. But we got an opportunity to pass something in the Congress that would be a win for everyone in Minnesota and a win for this country, and that\u2019s the USMCA.\nDid you know that Minnesota actually sends $7.2 billion of exports to Canada and Mexico every single year?\u00a0 And we know that\u2019s only going to grow in this North Central State here in the Heartland of the country once the USMCA is signed into law.\u00a0 It\u00a0will be the largest trade deal in the history of this country, but the Congress has to pass it.\u00a0 But we\u2019re confident that if Speaker Pelosi will put it on the floor, it\u2019s going to pass.\u00a0 And it\u2019ll pass the Senate, and President Trump will sign it into law.\nSo I want you to let your voice be heard.\u00a0 Let all the people representing Minnesota in Washington, D.C. know that the folks here at Safety Signs know that a growing economy relies on trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first. And while you\u2019re at it, give Congresswoman Angie Craig a call and tell her you want the USMCA voted on the floor of the House and you wanted voted this year.\u00a0 Give her a call and let her know.\u00a0 And tell her I told you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 All right?\nI mean, tell Congresswoman Angie Craig, \u201cLet\u2019s put politics aside.\u201d\u00a0 And tell Speaker Pelosi to bring that trade deal to the floor and deliver a real win for all the people of Minnesota and all the people of America.\nBut listen, let me thank you all.\u00a0 Thank you all for taking time.\u00a0 Again, I want to express my appreciation to Sue and Jay Blanchard for your example, for your hospitality, for being just great, great small-business owners here in Minnesota.\u00a0 We\u2019re really proud to be with you today.\nAnd I want to congratulate again each and every one of you for making \u2014 making a business like this have such a great impact on this community, and, frankly, on the life of this state and this nation.\u00a0 And I want to promise you \u2014 I want to promise you: On behalf of my friend who\u2019s going to be landing not too long in the Twin Cities in that big blue and white plane, and on behalf of the First Family, and on behalf of our family, we\u2019re never going to stop fighting for the \u2014 to keep the promises that we made the people of Minnesota.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to make America safer than ever before.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to make America and Minnesota more prosperous than ever before.\u00a0 And to borrow a phrase, we\u2019re going to keep America great.\nThanks, everybody.\u00a0 God bless you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 God bless Minnesota.\u00a0 And God bless America.\u00a0 Thanks for the warm welcome.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEND\n"

        "text": "South Lawn\n4:32 P.M. EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So, we just completed a negotiation with China.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing very well.\u00a0 We\u2019re having another one tomorrow.\u00a0 I\u2019m meeting with the Vice Premier over at the White House.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s going really well, I will say.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s going really well.\nSo, we had a very, very good negotiation with China.\u00a0 They\u2019ll be speaking a little bit later, but they\u2019re basically wrapping it up, and we\u2019re going to see them tomorrow, right here.\u00a0 And it\u2019s going very well.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, what about the story about former President \u2014 Vice President Joe Biden and Ukraine, that he received $900,000 to himself, from Burisma Holdings?\u00a0 Do you think that\u2019s true?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 What happened?\u00a0 Who took $900,000?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There\u2019s a story out there that your personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said on \u201cSean Hannity\u201d last night that there is a possibility that Joe Biden took $900,000 out of \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I hope it\u2019s not true that \u2014 Joe Biden took $900,000?\u00a0 I haven\u2019t heard that.\u00a0 I hope it\u2019s not true.\u00a0 For the sake of the country, I hope that\u2019s not true.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t know anything about it.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you know the whistleblower\u2019s name?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 What?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you know the whistleblower\u2019s name?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Who?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you know the whistleblower\u2019s name?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 But I know the whistleblower has been very inaccurate because when we released the transcript of the conversation that I had with the President of Ukraine, who \u2014 frankly, today, was very good; somewhere in Ukraine, I guess, gave a news conference on unrelated things \u2014 was asked a question, and he said, \u201cPresident Trump behaved in a perfectly fine manner.\u00a0 There was nothing wrong in any way, shape, or form.\u201d\u00a0 Something to that effect.\u00a0 So, I appreciate that.\nBut the President of Ukraine, that should be case over, because the President of Ukraine said that the call was absolutely fine.\u00a0 I think he said that it resembled very much \u2014 and he remembered it \u2014 it was just like the transcript.\nNow, the transcript is a perfect transcript.\u00a0 There shouldn\u2019t be any further questions.\u00a0 But the President of Ukraine just made that statement, so that\u2019s good.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, what conversations have you had with Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I don\u2019t know those gentlemen.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You were in pictures with them.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Now, it\u2019s possible I have a picture with them, because I have a picture with everybody.\u00a0 I have a picture with everybody here.\u00a0 But somebody said there may be a picture or something where \u2014 at a fundraiser or somewhere.\u00a0 And so \u2014 but I have pictures with everybody.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have you talked with them?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anybody I don\u2019t have pictures with.\nI don\u2019t know them.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know about them, I don\u2019t know what they do.\u00a0 But, I don\u2019t know, maybe they were clients of Rudy.\u00a0 You\u2019d have to ask Rudy.\u00a0 I just don\u2019t know.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have you spoken with Rudy Giuliani today, sir?\u00a0 Have you spoken to him?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, should the Senate allow a full trial if the House does impeach?\u00a0 The Republican (inaudible) Mitch McConnell said he would.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I don\u2019t know how you can impeach on a conversation with the President of a country \u2014 in this case, Ukraine \u2014 which was a perfect conversation, where the President of Ukraine just said there was no pressure put on him whatsoever, that we had an absolutely perfect conversation.\u00a0 Then, on top of that, and maybe less importantly, frankly, but on top of that, we have a transcript of the conversation, fortunately, that\u2019s perfect.\nAnd I do think this: I think it\u2019s very unfair to heads of countries when they think every time they make a conversation or have a conversation with the President of the United States, it\u2019s going to be on, you know, all over the world.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s very unfair.\nBut, in the case \u2014 in the case of what we\u2019re talking about, we released a perfect conversation.\u00a0 The President of Ukraine just confirmed that.\u00a0 And that should be case over.\nI will say this: Adam Schiff took that conversation before he saw it and fabricated a conversation.\u00a0 To me, that\u2019s criminal.\u00a0 What he did is criminal.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, do you intend to block Ambassador Yovanovitch from testifying tomorrow?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I just don\u2019t think you\u2019re running country \u2014 I just don\u2019t think that you can have all of these people testifying about every conversation you\u2019ve had.\u00a0 In this case, we have a transcript.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve given it almost immediately.\u00a0 It\u2019s called \u201ctransparency.\u201d\u00a0 Nobody has been more transparent than me.\u00a0 So, you have a transcript.\u00a0 And in this case, you also have the President of Ukraine confirming that, absolutely, it was a perfect conversation.\nBut the Democrats have committed crimes because they made up the conversation.\u00a0 The whistleblower was wrong.\u00a0 You know, I don\u2019t think people should be allowed.\u00a0 You have to run a country.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think you should be allowed to do that.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, have you spoken to the U.S. diplomat\u2019s \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Say it?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have you spoken to the U.S. diplomat\u2019s wife, Anne Sacoolas?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I can\u2019t hear.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have you spoken to the U.S. diplomat\u2019s wife, Anne Sacoolas?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have you spoken with the U.S. diplomat\u2019s wife, Anne Sacoolas?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Are you talking about in the UK?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 They\u2019re in the process of being spoken to.\u00a0 We\u2019re working on that.\u00a0 I did have a conversation yesterday with Boris Johnson, a good one.\u00a0 And we\u2019re talking about diplomatic immunity.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very interesting situation.\u00a0 We are trying to work something out.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Will you reconsider the decision?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So we\u2019re going to work \u2014 we\u2019re going to try and work something out.\u00a0 I think we\u2019ll be able to.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014 Mr. President, sir, Secretary Perry was just subpoenaed by the House Intel Committee for documents related to the \u2014 to Ukraine, sir.\u00a0 Any response to that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 How many people can they talk to?\u00a0 We had a simple conversation.\u00a0 Everybody knows what the conversation was because I gave it immediately when I heard about it.\nThe whistleblower, who seems to be a Democrat that\u2019s involved with a lot of people, gave a false interpretation of the conversation because we have the conversation.\nThe President of Ukraine just said, just now, that the conversation was absolutely perfect.\u00a0 No problem.\u00a0 It was a very good conversation.\u00a0 So I don\u2019t know why they\u2019d be calling Rick Perry.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know why they\u2019d be calling all these people.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very bad situation for our country.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How do you know the whistleblower is a Democrat, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It was reported.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you concerned that Rudy Giuliani could be indicted in all of this?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I hope not.\u00a0 Again, I don\u2019t know how he knows these people \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They\u2019re his clients.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 What?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They\u2019re his clients.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Okay, well, then, they\u2019re clients.\u00a0 I mean, you know, he\u2019s got a lot of clients.\u00a0 So, I just don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t spoken to Rudy about it.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\nI will say this: From what I heard \u2014 I just heard about this \u2014 they said, \u201cWe have nothing to do with it.\u00a0 We\u2019re totally \u2014 we have nothing to do with it.\u201d\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Were you joking when you asked China to investigate the Bidens?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Was I what?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Were you joking when you asked China to investigate?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 China has to do whatever they want.\u00a0 If they want to look into something, they can look into it.\u00a0 If they don\u2019t want to look into it, they don\u2019t have to.\u00a0 Frankly, are far as I\u2019m concerned, if China wants to look into something, I think that\u2019s great.\u00a0 And if they don\u2019t want to, I think that\u2019s great too.\u00a0 That\u2019s up to China.\nYeah.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, thank you.\u00a0 Is it safe to say that Trey Gowdy is now your Chief Counsel and Rudy Giuliani is moving to the back?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, Trey Gowdy is a terrific guy.\u00a0 I think there\u2019s a problem with he can\u2019t start for another couple of months because of lobbying rules and regulations.\u00a0 So, you\u2019ll have to ask about that.\nI just heard Trey Gowdy can\u2019t start until sometime after January because of the lobbying rules and regulations.\u00a0 So, I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 So, we\u2019ll have to see.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So Giuliani stays on?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I haven\u2019t spoken to him.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t spoken.\nGo ahead.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Which of the three choices on Syria that you just articulated in a tweet do you think you will follow?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Perhaps the last one, I hope.\u00a0 I hope the last one.\u00a0 Of the three, I hope it\u2019s going to be the last one.\nLook, we have no soldiers in Syria.\u00a0 We\u2019ve won.\u00a0 We\u2019ve beat ISIS.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve beat them badly and decisively.\u00a0 We have no soldiers.\nThe last thing I want to do is bring thousands and thousands of soldiers in and defeat everybody again.\u00a0 We\u2019ve already done that.\nSo what we have is really two choices:\u00a0You have the choice of bringing in the military and defeating everybody again, or you have the choice of financially doing some very strong things to Turkey so that they take it a little bit easy on, really, competition that is \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s being fairly treated in many ways, okay?\u00a0 We have a very good relationship with the Kurds.\u00a0 Or we can mediate.\u00a0 I hope we can mediate, John.\u00a0 I hope we can mediate.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Has Turkey gone beyond the limits, in your opinion, so far?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Say it?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Has Turkey gone beyond the limits you set up so far?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Turkey knows where I stand.\u00a0 And the last thing \u2014 okay, very simple:\u00a0We had a big victory.\u00a0 We left the area.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think the American people want to see us go back in with our military, go back into that area again.\nWe won.\u00a0 We left the area.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think we want to go back in.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see what happens.\u00a0 We are going to possibly do something very, very tough with respect to sanctions and other financial things.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, on Minnesota \u2014 you\u2019re headed to Minnesota.\u00a0 Do you think you can win in Minnesota?\u00a0 It\u2019s a long-time blue state.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think we can win.\u00a0 It\u2019s been a long time since a Republican won.\u00a0 We have a 20,000-seat auditorium.\u00a0 You know, we have the \u2014 it\u2019s essentially Madison Square Garden.\u00a0 And it\u2019s sold out.\u00a0 Over 80,000 people requested tickets.\u00a0 It\u2019ll be totally sold out.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know who\u2019s going, but it\u2019ll be totally sold out.\u00a0 If you\u2019re not going to be there, I\u2019m going to miss you.\u00a0 But they have a line now that\u2019s many blocks long.\u00a0 It\u2019s amazing.\u00a0 We have a line, right now in Minnesota, that\u2019s many blocks long.\u00a0 I think I can win in Minnesota.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you think Ilhan Omar is helping you win in Minnesota?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think Omar is helping us win in Minnesota and other places.\u00a0 I\u2019ll see you all \u2014 I\u2019ll see you in Minnesota.\u00a0 I\u2019ll see you in Minnesota.\nEND\n4:43 P.M.

CDT\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, hello, Iowa!\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 To Governor Reynolds; to Senator Grassley; Senator Ernst; former Congressman David Young; to EPA\u2019s Assistant Administrator Anne Idsal; to Speaker of the House Pat Grassley \u2013- (applause); all the local leaders and guests and neighbors and friends; and to Rob Manning and Manning Farms: It is great to be back in the Hawkeye State.\u00a0 Thank you for that wonderful, warm welcome.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI\u2019m really honored to see you all turned out today.\u00a0 Thank you for taking some time away from work and your obligations to talk about an issue of great importance to Iowa and great importance to the nation.\nBut let me say thanks to a few friends who are with us today, not just \u2014 not just do I want to thank her for that overly generous introduction, but I have to tell you, there is no more dynamic or hardworking governor in the United States of America than Governor Kim Reynolds.\u00a0 Would you join me in thanking her?\u00a0 Take a bow, Kim.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 She\u2019s doing a phenomenal job for Iowa.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd let me thank another friend of mine who I\u2019ve come to know well.\u00a0 In my duties as Vice President, I find my way to the United States Senate on a regular basis, and I get a chance to interact with both of your senators.\u00a0 But I\u2019ll tell you, this one \u2014 this one is amazing.\u00a0 She likes to say she\u2019s a mother, a soldier, a leader.\u00a0 She was born and raised here, combat veteran, served our country for almost a quarter of a century in the Armed Forces of the United States.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll tell you today: She is a champion for Iowa and a champion for the conservative agenda.\u00a0 Join me in thanking Senator Joni Ernst for her strong and principled leadership.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, Senator.\nAnd finally, it\u2019s a real privilege to be here with, frankly, a hero of mine.\u00a0 I first discovered him on CSPAN back in the 1990s \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 when he was serving in the United States House of Representatives.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cI like that guy.\u201d\u00a0 He would go on to the United States Senate.\u00a0 In fact, he served in the Congress now for more than 40 years.\u00a0 And I can tell you, he has been a champion for his fellow Iowa farmers like no one else.\u00a0 He has been a champion for our constitutional liberties as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and he\u2019s obviously a terrific grandfather.\u00a0 Join me in thanking Senator Chuck Grassley for his great, great leadership for Iowa.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIt really is great to be here with so many friends.\u00a0 And let me mention one more friend of mine, who, when I told him last night that I was headed to Iowa, I think he looked just a little bit jealous.\u00a0 But he\u2019s a man who loves the state of Iowa and a man the people of Iowa put their confidence in three years ago.\u00a0 I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut it is great to be back on a farm.\u00a0 And it\u2019s especially great to be here at a \u2014 at a great family farm here in Iowa.\u00a0 You know, I grew up south of Highway 40 myself in southern Indiana.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I didn\u2019t grow up on a farm but we \u2014 we had some cows and I hung up \u2014 hung out all the time with friends who were on family farms.\u00a0 And this one we\u2019re standing on today is so emblematic of everything that\u2019s great about family farming.\nYou know, I\u2019m told that Rob Manning is just the latest in a long line of farmers in his family.\u00a0 He\u2019s tilled this land and raised animals for five generations.\u00a0 And today, the hardworking men and women of Manning Farms have helped the Hawkeye State earn its place as the nation\u2019s largest corn producer, second-largest soybean producer, and the number-one producer of pork in the country.\u00a0 I mean, the truth is, what you grow here, what you raise here, you export around the world.\u00a0 So would you join me in thanking the Manning family and Rob and the whole team here at Manning Farms for all their leadership and all their contributions to the life of this state and nation?\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYou know, the truth is, what you grow here, what you raise here in Iowa, you \u2014 you export not just across the country, but all over the wider world.\u00a0 So we\u2019re going to talk about trade today, which Iowa knows a whole lot about.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to talk about a great opportunity for Iowa workers and Iowa businesses.\nBut before that, let me just take a minute to reflect on the progress we\u2019ve made because of the confidence the people of Iowa placed in this President and our administration back in 2016.\nYou know, when I think of the last three years, there\u2019s really only one way I can describe it:\u00a0 It\u2019s been three years of action.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s been three years of results.\u00a0 It\u2019s been three years of promises made and promises kept.\u00a0 But we\u2019re just getting started, Iowa.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI mean, think about it: After eight years of the weakest post-recession economy since the Great Depression, President Trump said that we could get this economy moving again if we put commonsense, conservative principles and free enterprise into practice.\u00a0 And President Donald Trump delivered.\nThis President has actually signed more bills rolling back federal red tape than any President in American history.\u00a0 And this President actually signed a measure that would ensure that farmers and ranchers can control and own their land \u201cin fee simple,\u201d as we like to say.\u00a0 Private property was restored when the President repealed the disastrous Waters of the USA rule.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd President Trump also kept a promise when he signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history.\u00a0 We cut taxes across the board for working families, for businesses large and small.\u00a0 And when he did that, we ended the death tax for nearly every American farmer.\u00a0 Death is no longer a taxable event.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd we also passed reforms and made it possible for farmers to immediately deduct 100 percent of the cost of new equipment.\u00a0 Anybody around farming knows those input costs play a critical role in the vitality of farming and \u2014 and being able to literally write off those costs in a single year made a tremendous difference.\nSo it\u2019s been about rolling back red tape.\u00a0 It\u2019s been about cutting taxes.\u00a0 But we\u2019ve also unleashed American energy.\u00a0 Do you know, next year, the United States will be a net exporter of oil for the first time in 75 years?\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd last week, I want to tell you, with the strong leadership of Governor Reynolds and with the unrelenting leadership of Senator Grassley and Senator Ernst, President Trump announced an agreement on the renewable fuel standard that will ensure net production reaches 15 billion gallons every year.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd I want to thank \u2014 I want to thank your senators and your governor for being such champions \u2014 such champions of renewable fuels.\u00a0 I mean, Iowa is not just going to be feeding the country, we\u2019re going to \u2014 we\u2019re going to continue to fuel the country as well.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo, as we cut taxes, roll back regulation, unleash American energy, the results have been amazing.\u00a0 Since Election Day 2016, businesses large and small in the city and on the farm have created 6.5 million new jobs, including 22,000 jobs right here in the Hawkeye State.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut I\u2019m here today, my friends, because, for all the progress we\u2019ve made, we\u2019ve still got work to do.\u00a0 Because as you heard from this stage earlier, we have an incredible opportunity before us.\nOver one year ago, President Trump negotiated the largest trade deal in American history: the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I was there.\u00a0 I was there all along the way for a lot of the negotiations, and I\u2019ll tell you what: The President drove a hard bargain.\u00a0 He put American jobs, American workers, and American farmers first, and negotiated a great deal.\nBut as I stand before you today, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress have refused to bring it to the floor of the House of Representatives.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\nI came to Iowa today to turn up the heat.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I came to Iowa today to say it\u2019s time for the Democrats in Congress to do their job, put politics aside, and pass the USMCA this year.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThe truth is \u2014 and we all know it \u2014 Democrats have been spending all their time on endless investigations and a partisan impeachment.\u00a0 But enough is enough.\u00a0 The American people deserve better.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I mean, the time has come \u2014 the time has come for Congresswoman Cindy Axne and all the Democrats in Congress that represent Iowa to put Iowa first, put America first, and pass the USMCA this year.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd I\u2019ll make you a promise: Whatever the Democrats in Congress choose to spend their time on, President Trump and I are never going to stop fighting for you and the agenda that Iowa voted for in 2016.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Count on it.\nWe\u2019re not going to allow Democrats in Congress to distract us from working on behalf of all of you and the people of this country.\u00a0 We\u2019re never going to stop delivering on a strong national defense, secure borders, more conservative judges to our courts, and jobs, jobs, jobs.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We\u2019re never going to stop fighting for that agenda because that agenda has made America great again.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo I stand before you today, our nation and our liberties are more secure.\u00a0 Unemployment is at a 50-year low, and more Americans are working today than ever before.\u00a0 And the truth is, the American economy has come roaring back because of the leadership of this President, because of the strong support of our allies in the Congress and in state houses around the country.\nBut I want to assure you, the President and I also know this economy has mostly come back because all of you.\u00a0 Because given the opportunity of more freedom, more opportunity, the American people have stepped up.\u00a0 And with their hard work and dedication and commitment, you brought the American economy back.\u00a0 It\u2019s one story at a time, one family at a time.\nI mean, this \u2014 the truth is, it\u2019s stories like a farmer that I heard about on the way here nearby in Dallas City, whose family has been a pillar of the community for generations.\u00a0 In fact, I was told today that when they first started out, his family used draft horses to plow their fields, and had to practically feed their livestock by hand.\u00a0 But today, that same farm has drawn national attention by using state-of-the-art technology.\u00a0 They\u2019re producing more crops at a lower cost.\u00a0 They\u2019re making this community, this state, and this nation proud.\u00a0 So would you join me in recognizing Tom Barrett and the whole Barrett family farm?\u00a0 Where are you all?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, Tom.\nI\u2019m told we also have with us the first-generation owners of a farm just a few miles down the road.\u00a0 They started it three decades ago with just a few dollars to their name.\u00a0 And since then, they\u2019ve grown that farm to more than 150 employees, hundreds of head of cattle and hogs.\u00a0 And as they\u2019ve said, most importantly, it\u2019s where they raised their four daughters and two sons.\u00a0 They are proof of the American Dream, in this first- generation family farm.\u00a0 So would you join me in giving a warm round of applause to two hardworking farmers here in Iowa that represent all \u2014 everything that\u2019s great about agriculture?\u00a0 Brett and Teresa Voss, where are you?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Take a bow.\u00a0 Here we are.\u00a0 Thanks, Brett.\u00a0 Thanks, Teresa.\nI mean, I mentioned these two families because they\u2019re really emblematic of each and every one of you.\u00a0 They\u2019re proof that you give American farmers and American workers a level playing field, that our farmers and our ranchers and our workers can compete and win with anyone in the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s the truth.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd that\u2019s why, since the first day of this administration, we\u2019ve been working to open up markets all over the world.\u00a0 I\u2019m proud to report to you that President Trump renegotiated our trade agreement with South Korea.\u00a0 Earlier this week, the President actually signed agreements with Japan that not only will expand digital trade but will expand agricultural trade by billions of dollars a year to Japan.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThis President has also put China on notice that the era of economic surrender is over.\u00a0 We\u2019ve taken a strong stand to demand that China open their markets to what we make and what we grow and treat American businesses fairly.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThe President has been taking a strong stand, but in just the last few weeks, China announced the purchase of more than 2 million metric tons of soybeans.\u00a0 And as I learned on the way here from our U.S. Trade Representative, we\u2019re going to welcome a Chinese delegation to our nation\u2019s capital a little bit later this week.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 The negotiations are going forward with China, but I promise you, President Trump is going to continue to stand strong for American workers and American farmers.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo we\u2019ve made great progress, but make no mistake about it:\u00a0 As you\u2019ve heard from this stage today, when we get the USMCA done, it\u2019s going to be a big win for America, and a big win for American farmers.\u00a0 I mean, the truth is, we\u2019re gathered here today on this beautiful farm on this breezy day because it\u2019s time for Congress to act.\u00a0 It\u2019s time for Congress to pass the USMCA.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd you know why.\u00a0 According to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA is going to add about $68 billion to our economy, right out of the gate.\u00a0 And we predict, conservatively, that it will create more than 175,000 new jobs.\u00a0 They also proposed that the USMCA will increase American agricultural exports by more than $2 billion.\nNow, here in Iowa, this great state already exports more than $6.6 billion in goods and services to Canada and Mexico every year.\u00a0 In fact, nearly half of all of Iowa\u2019s exports go to Mexico and Canada.\u00a0 And nearly 100,000 good-paying Iowa jobs depend on exports.\u00a0 That\u2019s why your governor, that\u2019s why your senators, that\u2019s why your President, are demanding that Congress pass the USMCA and pass it this year.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Iowa is depending on it.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd the truth is, Iowa\u2019s farmers and ranchers really have the most to gain, since this great state is the nation\u2019s second-largest agricultural exporting state.\u00a0 You produce more than $10.3 billion in goods every single year.\u00a0 And under the USMCA, we know these numbers are only going to grow, supporting jobs and opportunities and families across Iowa.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to create more prosperity all across this state.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why I wanted to come here to talk about it.\nThe truth is, we can get it done but it\u2019s going to take all of us to do it.\u00a0 I came here to turn up the heat.\u00a0 But now it\u2019s time for Iowans to turn up the heat on your Democrats in Congress and tell them Iowa needs the USMCA this year.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Will you do it?\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI mean, I want you to \u2014 I want you to reach out to your elected officials in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 Tell them \u2014 say, \u201cI ran into Mike on a farm the other day\u201d \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 \u201cand he was pointing out to me that half of our exports from Iowa, as the governor had said, go to Canada and Mexico.\u201d\u00a0 And we got this great new trade agreement that\u2019s a win for agriculture.\u00a0 It\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a win for Iowa, a win for America and you need to get it done.\u00a0 I mean, tell them what the USMCA is going to mean to Iowa farmers.\u00a0 But let me save you a nickel.\u00a0 You don\u2019t need to call Senator Joni Ernst or Senator Chuck Grassley because they\u2019re leading the charge in the United States Senate for the USMCA.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThe President I couldn\u2019t be more grateful for their leadership.\u00a0 But right here in Waukee, there are some people you can call.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I mean, why don\u2019t you call Congresswoman Cindy Axne?\u00a0 Call Congresswoman Abby Finkenauer.\u00a0 And while you\u2019re at it, call Congressman Dave Loebsack, and tell them, \u201cIowa needs the USMCA.\u201d\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd by the way, after you \u2014 after you make that call to the people representing Iowa, you know, it seems like every four years, about this time, you see a lot of people coming through Iowa, right?\u00a0 It seems like there\u2019s a lot of politicians making their way through this state, getting ready for next year\u2019s election.\u00a0 This first-in-the-nation state of Iowa.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And I got to tell you \u2014 I got to tell you, you need to know, every single Democrat running for President is opposed to the USMCA.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Booo \u2014\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So if you run into him at a diner, or on a street corner \u2014 which I know is pretty common around here in Iowa \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 you need to tell the Democrats running for the highest office in the land that Iowa needs the USMCA.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI mean, I\u2019ll tell you, one of the things I love about Iowa is that it\u2019s so much like Indiana \u2014 people with big hearts and strong opinions.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So let them hear your opinion.\u00a0 It will make a difference.\nListen, I want to thank you for coming out today.\u00a0 I really do.\u00a0 Coming out in the middle of a busy week, taking some time to focus on an issue that\u2019s so important to this state, so important this nation.\nAnd I \u2014 let me \u2014 let me say again, how grateful I am to Senator Grassley, Senator Ernst, and your great Governor Kim Reynolds.\u00a0 Would you give them one more round of applause?\u00a0 They are just incredible champions.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you so much.\nAnd also, just on behalf of my wife, Karen, and our family, let me just take this opportunity also to say thank you for the privilege of being your Vice President.\u00a0 It is the greatest honor of my life.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you for the confidence you placed in your President and his Vice President.\nAnd finally \u2014 finally, let me say it\u2019s also great to be back on a farm.\u00a0 I\u2019m pretty partial to the farm.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I mean, the truth is, farmers have contributed so much to the life of this nation, you can never calculate all of it.\u00a0 And I\u2019m not just talking about to the economy throughout the long history of this country.\u00a0 But farmers and family farmers have contributed so much vitality to our communities and to our states.\u00a0 Farmers have served in our armed forces.\u00a0 Their patriotism and their values have strengthened this nation throughout our history.\nYou know, I\u2019m always struck \u2014 that book that I try and open every single morning in a little quiet time, how many times we\u2019re told to consider the farmer.\u00a0 And I believe that\u2019s because in \u2014 in the farmer, we \u2014 we find all the virtues that lead to a happy and productive life:\u00a0 honesty, integrity, hard work, resilience, family, and faith.\nAnd so you being out here today, and the support that you have shown to this President and his Vice President, our agenda, means that much more to me because it comes from the American farmer.\u00a0 It comes from the best of America.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd in the days and weeks that lie ahead, I\u2019ll make you a promise.\u00a0 I\u2019ll make you promise.\u00a0 You know, one of the more humorous things that I ever hear is when people will stop me as I\u2019m traveling around the country and they say, \u201cTell the President just to keep going forward.\u201d\u00a0 You know, that\u2019s something you never have to tell President Donald Trump.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\nI tell people, like we used to say in Indiana, \u201cAll the reverse is stripped out of that pickup truck. It only goes forward and we\u2019re never going to stop fighting for the agenda that Iowa voted for.\u201d\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I promise you.\nWe\u2019re never going to stop fighting \u2014 never going to stop fighting for the policies that will revive the American economy, strengthen the constitutional foundation of our courts, rebuild our military.\nAnd I know that with your continued support, we\u2019re going to keep America growing strong.\u00a0 We\u2019re going \u2014 we\u2019re going to make America safer than ever before.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to make America more prosperous than ever before.\u00a0 When we get this USMCA done and on the President\u2019s desk, with President Donald Trump in the White House, with these great leaders representing and leading you from the Congress to the state house, and with God\u2019s help, we\u2019re going to keep America great.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 God bless you, Iowa.\u00a0 And God bless America.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEND\n3:42 P.M.

        "text": "Roosevelt Room\n3:38 P.M. EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much.\u00a0 I\u2019ll start by saying I just spoke with\u00a0Boris Johnson, and we had a good talk about a number of subjects, and we\u2019ll maybe talk about it a little bit later.\u00a0 But we had an extended conversation and some pretty good ideas, I think.\u00a0 They want to see if we can do a couple of things, and they\u2019ll be doing certain things for us.\nI want to also thank the Minneapolis Police Department.\u00a0 They have been so incredible, what they\u2019ve done.\u00a0 Tomorrow, we have a tremendous amount of people planned to go.\u00a0 I know the requests have been incredible.\u00a0 So, I think it\u2019s a great state and we\u2019re going to have a lot of fun tomorrow night.\u00a0 I think a lot of you are going to be with us.\u00a0 And then, on Friday night, we\u2019ll be going to Louisiana, and there\u2019s a big election on Saturday to see whether or not there\u2019s a runoff, most likely.\u00a0 And I think we\u2019ll do very well.\u00a0 The Republicans are doing very well despite the witch hunt that they have on Republicans.\nSo I just want to thank everybody for being here and coming to the White House on this important occasion.\u00a0 In a few moments, I\u2019ll be signing two executive orders to expand our record-breaking regulatory reduction campaign that is helping to fuel our incredible economic boom.\u00a0 I guess the stock market is up close to 250 points today, and this is despite lots of trade deals that are getting done one by one.\nWe did a deal with South Korea \u2014 a big one, a really big one.\u00a0 And we did one yesterday with Japan.\u00a0 And that now goes into effect, and it\u2019s tremendous for our farmers.\nAs you know, we have China coming.\u00a0 They\u2019ll be coming tomorrow.\u00a0 We have the Vice Premier of China coming.\u00a0 So we have a lot of big things happening.\u00a0 We have some tremendous deals under negotiation.\u00a0 So despite all of that, we have a great economy and a great market.\u00a0 Our housing market is on fire, and things are really doing well.\nYou look at Asia, they\u2019re not doing well.\u00a0 Look at China; China is having a hard time at this moment, and I think they\u2019d like to make a deal very badly.\nAnd so we have a lot of things that are really exciting.\u00a0 And to be in the midst of negotiating some of the worst trade deals ever made, and to be breaking them up and changing them for the good of the American taxpayer and for our country, and to still be doing so well.\u00a0 We had over 100 record-breaking stock markets.\u00a0 I think 121 or something.\u00a0 I\u2019ll get you the exact number.\u00a0 But many, many days, we broke the record.\u00a0 And we continue to do well.\nAnd when these trade deals are done, and when certain other things that we\u2019re doing are done, it\u2019s going to be at a level that\u2019s incredible.\n(Baby coos.)\nThat was the cutest noise.\u00a0 What was that?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I heard this \u2014 see, I\u2019m used to hearing them.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And there\u2019s nothing cute about them.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So beautiful.\u00a0 And don\u2019t feel bad, he can \u2014 just do whatever you want, okay?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 That\u2019s a beautiful sound.\nToday, we take bold, new action to protect Americans from out-of-control bureaucracy and stop regulators from imposing secret rules and hidden penalties on the American people.\nWe\u2019re delighted to be joined on this occasion by Acting Director Russ Vought, who has really done a fantastic job; Deputy Attorney [General] Jeffrey Rosen.\u00a0 Are you busy enough, Jeff?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Huh?\u00a0 And Congressman Mark Meadows.\u00a0 Mark, fantastic that you\u2019re here.\u00a0 Louisiana Solicitor General \u2014 oh, I\u2019ll be there \u2014 Liz Murrill.\u00a0 Where\u2019s Liz?\u00a0 I\u2019ll see you on Friday.\nMS. MURRILL:\u00a0 Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll be there, but we have a big crowd, so it\u2019s going to be great.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Liz.\nAnd several other state and local officials.\u00a0 We want to thank you all for being here.\nFor many decades, federal agencies have been issuing thousands of pages of so-called \u201cguidance\u201d documents \u2014 a pernicious kind of regulation imposed by unaccountable bureaucrats in the form of commentary on how rules should be interpreted.\nAll too often, guidance documents are a backdoor for regulators to effectively change the laws and vastly expand their scope and reach.\u00a0 Guidance has frequently been used to subject U.S. citizens and businesses to arbitrary and sometimes abusive enforcement actions.\u00a0 Ha!\u00a0 It sounds like they\u2019re talking about me.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I think they\u2019re talking about me.\u00a0 I might have a conflict in signing this deal.\nBecause of these materials and the fact that these materials are too often hidden and hard to find, many Americans learn of the rules only when federal agents come knocking on the door.\nThis regulatory overreach gravely undermines our constitutional system of government.\u00a0 Unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats must not be able to operate outside of the democratic system of government \u2014 wow \u2014 imposing their own private agenda on our citizens.\u00a0 A permanent federal bureaucracy cannot become a fourth branch of government, unanswerable to American voters.\u00a0 In America, the people must always reign.\nWith us today is Andy Johnson from Wyoming \u2014 great place \u2014 whose family is one of many that suffered from the absurd redefinitions and interpretations of federal bureaucrats.\u00a0 And Andy is here to say a few words.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to hear that Andy because I think you might be speaking about me or to me.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Where\u2019s Andy?\u00a0 Come on up here with that beautiful baby.\u00a0 Beautiful.\u00a0 That\u2019s great.\u00a0 Thank you, Andy.\nMR. JOHNSON:\u00a0 Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Go ahead, please.\nMR. JOHNSON:\u00a0 Well, thank you for having me, today, and my wife Morgan and my son, Roaman.\u00a0 I work as welder in Wyoming, and about five years ago, when I applied for a stock pond permit for my private property, I had no idea that the EPA would come knocking at my door and threaten me and my family \u2014 civilly, criminally, and a fine of $37,500 per day.\u00a0 The fines were up to $16 million when Pacific Legal Foundation stepped in and sued the EPA on my behalf, and my family.\nAnd, at that point, the EPA changed their attitude; we were able to come to an agreement.\u00a0 We won our case, but unlike a lot of other middle class Americans, that\u2019s not the case.\u00a0 They \u2014 we could have never fought.\u00a0 The litigation was way, way too expensive.\u00a0 So I\u2019d just like to thank the President today for signing this executive order, which will hold the EPA and other government agencies more responsible for their actions.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s fantastic.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR. JOHNSON:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So they had you up to $16 million.\u00a0 But that\u2019s peanuts for you, right?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 That\u2019s great.\u00a0 Glad it worked out and it\u2019s working out even better.\nWe\u2019re also joined by Richard Schok, who was prevented from expanding his business because of the obscure regulatory guidance on a rule from the 1980s \u2014 an old rule.\u00a0 And, Richard, please come up and talk about it.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Richard.\u00a0 Please.\nMR. SCHOK:\u00a0 Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR. SCHOK:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMr. President, I\u2019d like to thank you for the invitation to speak and bring much-needed attention to the reform to the rulemaking process used by the regulatory agencies.\nI operate a family-owned business in Fairbanks, Alaska.\u00a0 We purchased some land for our business about 20 years ago so we could move operations out of town to the new facility and expand our facilities.\u00a0 We\u2019ve spent the better part of 10 years and over $300,000 fighting with the regulatory agencies over the arbitrary and capricious nature of the Army Corps of Engineers wetland designation and their use of the Alaska supplement versus the 1987 congressionally-mandated Wetlands Manual.\nThis is effort is also \u2014 this effort does not include the time and energy put forth by the Pacific Legal Foundation on our behalf.\u00a0 I\u2019d like to thank those folks as well.\nThe last straw for us is when we lost our appeal in the Ninth Circuit Court when they held that the agencies can make the regulations they want and require without congressional approval or oversight.\nI\u2019m hopeful that the changes made today \u2014 with this executive order, other land owners will not be negatively impacted as we have.\u00a0 Thank you again for this opportunity.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It\u2019s great.\u00a0 Thank you, Richard.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWell, thank you very much, Richard.\u00a0 You know, you mention the Ninth Circuit.\u00a0 So, we have a lot of great new judges in the Ninth Circuit, and we\u2019re going to be very close to 182 new judges over the next very short period of time.\u00a0 So that\u2019ll be \u2014 we are in record territory by a lot.\nSo we\u2019re going to have 182 new federal judges, not including two Supreme Court judges.\u00a0 And I guess we\u2019re already at the 156 number.\u00a0 Jeff and Mark, I think we\u2019re at about 156 judges now signed and sitting and doing a great job.\u00a0 But we\u2019ll be at about 182 before we normalize \u2014 normalize, meaning retirement and various other reasons that they leave.\u00a0 And we could average about 40 or so a year from that process.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll have a \u2014 probably, a very big record number of judges \u2014 federal judges in this administration.\nAnd I want to thank President Obama for leaving us 138 empty slots, because that\u2019s a first.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 That\u2019s a first.\u00a0 I said, \u201cHow many do we have?\u201d\u00a0 He said, \u201cSir, you have 138 to 142.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d\u00a0 So I want to thank you, President Obama.\nAnd again, Richard, thank you very much for your nice words.\u00a0 When Americans and their businesses are sued by government agencies, they are sometimes not even given an explanation of what they do wrong, and how they can fix it.\nWith us today is Kevin Lunny, whose company was forced out of business through the terrible practice of a certain way of government handling of things.\u00a0 Not fair; not right.\u00a0 Kevin, please come up and discuss it.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Kevin.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nMR. LUNNY:\u00a0 My name is Kevin Lunny.\u00a0 I\u2019m a third-generation cattle rancher at the Point Reyes National Seashore in California.\nAbout several years ago, we also were the owners of the Drakes Bay oyster farm \u2014 a sustainable family business where we produced nearly half of all the oysters in the state of California.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Wow.\nMR. LUNNY:\u00a0 In 2014, the National Park Service launched a National Environmental Policy Act process that costs millions of dollars and lasted over eight years.\u00a0 And the National Park Service forced our oyster farm out of business.\u00a0 And if that wasn\u2019t enough for our family and our community, today the rest of agriculture, which includes about another 24 ranching family farm businesses within the National Seashore, are facing the exact same process.\nOur fear is that that process could ultimately be facing \u2014 and those families may be facing what the oyster farm faced.\u00a0 And so I\u2019m here, Mr. President, thanking you for calling this meeting together so we can have this discussion.\u00a0 We urge you to continue your good work in following these policies and making sure these federal policies are managed in a way that family farmers and ranchers like us can actually benefit and survive these procedures and \u2014 so they\u2019re not just for federal agencies that have pre-decided what they want before the process has begun and for professional litigants that abuse the process.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well thank you, Kevin.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 And the business is \u2014 is the business gone now?\nMR. LUNNY:\u00a0 The business is gone.\u00a0 Twenty million oysters destroyed.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 They forced you out of business?\nMR. LUNNY:\u00a0 Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So, I have to say, Kevin, I really \u2014 I know what you\u2019ve been through.\u00a0 I read a little bit about it.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve heard about it, also.\u00a0 And it\u2019s very sad.\u00a0 But we thank you both for being here, very much.\u00a0 Really, thank you very much.\nNo American should ever face such persecution from their own government \u2014 except, perhaps, your President.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Don\u2019t feel bad, Kevin.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 They treated you better than they treat me.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I do believe that\u2019s true, huh?\u00a0 I do believe that\u2019s true, Meadows.\nToday, I am taking action to stop it.\u00a0 My first executive order will require agencies to publish guidance documents online, so that small businesses and everyday citizens can easily find them.\nAgencies will have to seek public input on the most important guidance, and the whole process will be closely overseen by the White House.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have somebody right here in the White House looking at it, Kevin, so this doesn\u2019t happen to other people.\u00a0 You\u2019re very brave to be here.\u00a0 I really think it\u2019s incredible.\u00a0 I really mean it.\u00a0 Americans will no longer be subject to the rules of hidden games that are played on the public.\nThe second order I will sign today will protect American citizens from secret interpretations of regulations, unexpected penalties, and violations of their rights.\u00a0 From now on, agencies will be required to inform individuals about any case against them and respond to their arguments.\u00a0 It will be the agency\u2019s duty to fully educate small businesses about new regulatory changes.\nToday\u2019s action is just the latest step in my administration\u2019s tireless fight to curtail job-killing, soul-crushing regulations.\u00a0 I want to thank Jeff for doing the great job.\u00a0 The Justice Department worked very hard with all of our people over here.\u00a0 They did a fantastic job and I want to thank you very much, Jeff.\nWe ended the war on American energy.\u00a0 We\u2019re cancelling restrictions that devastated American autoworkers.\u00a0 We\u2019re stopping regulations that micromanaged our great farmers.\u00a0 We\u2019re bringing major companies back to our country.\u00a0 They want to be here.\u00a0 We\u2019re the hot economy.\u00a0 We\u2019re the place they want to be.\u00a0 And we are reversing the last administration\u2019s ridiculous attack on, as an example, incandescent lightbulbs.\nWe\u2019re also working, as you know \u2014 cars are very expensive.\u00a0 Far too expensive.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to be able to bring the price of cars down about $3,500 \u2014 and, at the same time, make the car a lot more affordable and a lot safer.\u00a0 So we\u2019re going to have affordability, safety, and we\u2019ll also be getting some of the old cars off the roads, because people now have an incentive to buy a new car that\u2019s a lot less of a problem, from an environmental standpoint.\u00a0 It\u2019s really an amazing thing.\nWe\u2019re going against California.\u00a0 And they make their cars so light, it\u2019s papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9.\u00a0 And you get in an accident; it\u2019s very, very dangerous.\u00a0 So we\u2019re coming out with a whole new standard, and I think it\u2019s going to be something very special.\u00a0 It\u2019s gotten tremendous receptivity.\nSame thing with the lightbulb, the incandescent lights.\u00a0 Aside from the fact you look better \u2014 of course, who cares about looks?\u00a0 But you do look better with incandescent.\u00a0 They weren\u2019t allowed.\u00a0 And you have the privilege of buying now a much more expensive bulb under the past rules \u2014 much more expensive bulb that doesn\u2019t have a good-looking light.\u00a0 But maybe, very importantly, when the bulb is out and no good, it\u2019s literally considered a hazardous waste site, because it\u2019s all the gasses.\u00a0 And if it breaks, you\u2019re supposed to bring it to a certain location.\u00a0 And I say, \u201cWho does that?\u201d\u00a0 Nobody.\u00a0 Nobody does.\u00a0 It\u2019s very dangerous.\nSo we have a \u2014 we\u2019re allowing people to choose.\u00a0 They can buy a much less expensive bulb that looks better, or they can spend a lot more money on what they were doing, and that\u2019s fine, too.\u00a0 They might like it.\u00a0 It might last longer, and that\u2019s okay.\u00a0 But it is still a hazardous situation when you have to dispose of these things, whereas in the old system, you don\u2019t have.\u00a0 So we\u2019re bringing the incandescent bulb back for those that want it.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have both alternatives.\u00a0 We like to have alternatives.\nAt the start of my presidency, I imposed a two-for-one rule on new regulations, requiring that for every new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.\nIn the first two years of the Obama-Sleepy Joe Biden administration, the cost of regulatory compliance went up by $245 billion.\u00a0 Can you believe that?\u00a0 And in our administration, we\u2019ve taken it down by more than that.\u00a0 So it\u2019s $245 billion up, and we\u2019ve taken it down by much more than that.\nAccording to the Economic Council of Advisers, our regulatory reductions will save the average American household over $3,000 \u2014 think of this \u2014 every single year. \u00a0Thanks to these regulation cuts, as well as our tax cuts and pro-American trade policies, our economy is stronger than it\u2019s ever been.\u00a0 Stronger than ever before.\u00a0 And that\u2019s despite all of these negotiations that we\u2019re doing to really make us into something that we\u2019ve never seen before \u2014 meaning, fair trade deals.\nWe\u2019ve created 6.4 million new jobs.\u00a0 Just last month, unemployment reached the lowest rate in over 50 years.\u00a0 The African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates have hit record lows.\u00a0 We have more people working in the United States today \u2014 almost 160 million people \u2014 than at any time in the history of our country.\u00a0 Wages are rising very fast, and twice as fast for low-income workers.\u00a0 The biggest beneficiary, actually, is the low-income worker.\u00a0 Their wages are rising at a rate that we haven\u2019t seen in many, many decades.\nWhen I first started campaigning \u2014 many of you were with me \u2014 I used to talk about workers that would make more, years ago, 21 years ago, than they made a few years ago, because now it\u2019s gone up a lot.\u00a0 But a few years ago.\u00a0 And they\u2019d have two jobs and three jobs, and yet they did better 21 years before.\nWith today\u2019s executive order, we continue this incredible economic success and we defend American liberty for generations to come.\nI would like to now invite Acting Director of OMB Russ Vought to say a few words about the exciting news.\u00a0 And I want to thank Russ for doing an incredible job.\u00a0 And when Russ is finished, we\u2019re going to sign the executive orders.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nACTING DIRECTOR VOUGHT:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 As a result of your leadership, today we\u2019re making a major step forward in the effort to drain the swamp and to get our arms wrapped around the administrative state.\u00a0 We can\u2019t do that until we know all of the dark, regulatory, stealth regulation that is out there, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re asking all agencies to be putting on their website \u2014 on a searchable website \u2014 all of these regulations, so that we can understand what it is, and anything that\u2019s not put up there is rescinded.\nSecondly, we want to make sure that the American people \u2014 families and small businesses \u2014 are no longer bullied by their federal government.\u00a0 We\u2019ve all had to deal with the motor vehicle department down the street from us.\u00a0 Think about dealing with the federal government; it\u2019s an entirely different situation.\u00a0 And the people that are here today, who have flown in on their own dime to be a part of this celebration, can attest to that.\nWe want to make sure that there are no stories ever again of people being bullied by their federal government.\u00a0 So we\u2019re thrilled that you took this on, Mr. President.\u00a0 Looking forward to these executive orders.\u00a0 Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nCome on, folks.\u00a0 Gather around.\n(The executive orders are signed.)\nWhere\u2019s Kevin?\nMR. LUNNY:\u00a0 Right here.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Come here.\u00a0 (Hands over pen.)\u00a0 (Applause.)\nPlenty to go around.\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Thank you very much everybody.\u00a0 Congratulations.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you going to take any action regarding the Turkish attacks in Northern Syria?\u00a0 And have the Kurds, as Senator Graham said, been shamelessly abandoned?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So, we have no soldiers in the area.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been talking to Turkey for three years.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been wanting to do this for many years, as you know.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been fighting each other for centuries.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been fighting each other for \u2014 hundreds of years, this has been going on.\nWe were put into this battle \u2014 interjected.\u00a0 It was supposed to be a 30 \u2014 a 30-day period.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve been there for many, many years.\u00a0 And it\u2019s time to get out.\u00a0 We\u2019re speaking to both sides.\u00a0 We\u2019ve told President Erdo\u011fan how we feel.\u00a0 But we are speaking to both sides, and we\u2019re seeing what can be made out of a situation.\nBut we have no soldiers in the area, you know.\u00a0 We\u2019re getting out of the endless wars.\u00a0 We have to do it.\u00a0 And eventually somebody was going to have to make the decision.\u00a0 And, frankly, we\u2019re getting a lot of praise from that decision.\u00a0 We \u2014 people are saying, \u201cGot to sometime bring our people back home.\u201d\nWe\u2019re really serving and we were serving as a police force.\u00a0 We had defeated ISIS.\u00a0 We defeated the caliphate, 100 percent.\u00a0 Erdo\u011fan and the existing groups of people, including Kurds \u2014 but you have the PKK, which is a natural enemy with Turkey, and likewise and opposite, they\u2019ve been fighting, again, for many, many years.\u00a0 They have \u2014 they\u2019re bitter enemies; have been always.\u00a0 Probably, possibly always will be.\nSo we are \u2014 we are out of there.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been out of there for a while.\u00a0 No soldiers whatsoever.\nWe are taking some of the most dangerous ISIS fighters out.\u00a0 We\u2019ve taken them out and we\u2019re putting them in different locations where it\u2019s secure.\u00a0 In addition, the Kurds are watching.\u00a0 And if the Kurds don\u2019t watch, then Turkey is going to watch because they don\u2019t want those people out any more than we do.\u00a0 But we have taken a certain number of ISIS fighters that are particularly bad.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve wanted to make sure that nothing happened with them, with respect to getting out.\u00a0 And I think we\u2019re doing a great job.\nI think the people of this country \u2014 I campaigned on ending the endless wars.\u00a0 We\u2019re all over the world, fighting wars.\u00a0 Half the places, nobody even knows what they\u2019re doing over there.\u00a0 And I feel that we are doing the right thing, and I think the country feels that, too.\nWe\u2019ve had tremendous support outside of the Washington \u2014 little Washington area.\u00a0 And even in Washington, people are saying, \u201cYou\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d\u00a0 It has to be done; otherwise, you\u2019re never going to do it.\nAt the same time, we\u2019re dealing with both sides.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to see what we can do.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In a statement this morning, you cautioned Erdo\u011fan.\u00a0 Since then, it appears as though there have been casualties on the Kurdish side.\u00a0 Are you\u00a0concerned about escalation?\u00a0 And are you concerned that Erdo\u011fan will try to wipe out the Kurds?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I will wipe out his economy if that happens.\u00a0 I\u2019ve already done it once, with Pastor Brunson.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure that he \u2014 I hope that he will act rationally.\u00a0 You do have to understand: They\u2019ve been fighting each other for many, many decades.\u00a0 Actually, for centuries, they\u2019ve been fighting each other.\u00a0 And it was time for the Americans \u2014 we did a great job.\nWe took care of ISIS.\u00a0 We captured 100 percent.\u00a0 Do you remember I was thinking, John, of leaving at 97 and 96 percent?\u00a0 And that last 3 or 4 percent was the hardest part.\u00a0 And they told me it would take a year to two years to do it, and I did it in a month.\u00a0 Remember that?\nI flew to Iraq and I met with a lot of great generals there.\u00a0 Great generals.\u00a0 They said, \u201cSir, we can do it in two weeks to a month.\u201d\u00a0 And we did it in two weeks to a month, and we took it.\u00a0 And, in the meantime, we\u2019ve been watching over a lot \u2014 with the Kurds \u2014 watching over a lot of prisoners.\u00a0\u00a0 Some very bad \u2014 some very bad people.\u00a0 A few, in particular, are very bad.\u00a0 Really bad.\u00a0 And some of those people we\u2019ve already taken.\u00a0 We\u2019ve taken them out.\nThey should go back, by the way.\u00a0 They should go back to Europe.\u00a0 Many of them came from Europe, but they should go back to Germany, to France, to \u2014 I spoke with Boris Johnson a couple \u2014 to UK.\u00a0 Some to UK, actually.\u00a0 But they came from various parts of Europe.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t come from our country, and we did them a big favor.\nAnd we said to France, we said to Germany, we said to various countries in Europe: \u201cWe\u2019d like you to take your people back.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWell, we don\u2019t want them.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want them.\u00a0 How about you taking them?\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want them either.\u00a0 Nobody wants them; they\u2019re bad.\u00a0 But somebody has to watch over them.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cLook, we did you a big favor.\u00a0 You take your people back.\u00a0 You take them back.\u201d\nThey\u2019re citizens, in many cases, of those countries \u2014 of France, Germany.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t want to take them back.\u00a0 I gave them one chance, I gave them another chance, I gave them a third chance, and I even gave them a fourth chance.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t want to take them back.\u00a0 Not that I blame them too much; they\u2019re used to this with the United States \u2014 taking advantage of the United States, whether it\u2019s on trade or NATO \u2014 to take advantage of the United States.\nBut we think that maybe the Kurds will do a job.\u00a0 And if not the Kurds, we think Turkey will do a job.\u00a0 But we have thousands of people.\u00a0 Thousands.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if you know that.\u00a0 We have thousands of captured fighters, and thousands and tens of thousands of family members.\u00a0 And we did a big favor to a lot of countries, and those countries didn\u2019t want to take them back.\u00a0 So that\u2019s the way it goes.\nSteve.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What if some of these ISIS fighters escape and pose a threat elsewhere?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, they\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe.\u00a0 That\u2019s where they want to go.\u00a0 They want to go back to their homes, but Europe didn\u2019t want them from us.\u00a0 We could have given it to them.\u00a0 They could have had trials.\u00a0 They could have\ndone whatever they wanted.\nBut as usual, it\u2019s not reciprocal.\u00a0 You know my favorite word, \u201creciprocal.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s all I want.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want an edge; I just want reciprocal.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not reciprocal, Steve.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a fair deal for the United States.\nAnd when President Obama took the PKK \u2014 you know, where they bring in PKK \u2014 that\u2019s a tough deal because that\u2019s been a mortal enemy of Turkey.\u00a0 So when you bring them in into a partnership, it\u2019s a tough situation because it\u2019s tough for Turkey; it\u2019s probably tough for them.\u00a0 They\u2019ve hated each other for many, many years \u2014 for hundreds of years.\u00a0 I mean, it\u2019s amazing, when you look at history and you look at culture.\u00a0 But you look at the length of the time and the fighting for so long.\nSo we imposed ourself into it.\u00a0 And look, I\u2019ve said it \u2014 I said it just yesterday: The single worst country the United States \u2014 if you take a look at, you know, what we\u2019re doing with countries and the relationships we have with countries \u2014\nBut maybe putting it a different way: The worst mistake that the United States has ever made, in my opinion, was going into the Middle East.\u00a0 It\u2019s a quagmire.\u00a0 We are up to close to $8 trillion, and we\u2019re bringing our folks back home.\u00a0 We have great, talented military.\u00a0 We\u2019re bringing them back home.\nOur military has never been stronger, but we\u2019re now acting as police.\u00a0 We\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re policing areas.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing jobs that other countries should be doing.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing jobs, frankly, that Europe should be doing.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing jobs that Russia should be doing, that Iran should be doing, that Iraq, Turkey, Syria should be doing.\u00a0 They should be doing this.\u00a0 We shouldn\u2019t be doing it.\u00a0 We\u2019re 7,000 miles away.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lindsey Graham is talking about imposing economic sanctions on Turkey over this incursion into Syria.\u00a0 What do you think about that?\u00a0 Would you support that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I think it\u2019s okay.\u00a0 I\u2019ve already told that to President Erdo\u011fan.\u00a0 Far more than sanctions \u2014 I\u2019ll do far more than sanctions.\u00a0 Lindsey and I feel differently.\u00a0 I think Lindsey would like to stay there for the next 200 years and maybe add a couple of hundred thousand people every place.\u00a0 But I disagree with Lindsey on that.\nBut I will tell you that I do agree on sanctions, but I actually think much tougher than sanctions if he doesn\u2019t do it in as humane a way as possible.\u00a0 But I\u2019ve gotten him to stop for \u2014 virtually, from the first day that I was in office.\u00a0 But they wanted to fight, and that\u2019s the way it is.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve done it for so long.\nYes, go ahead, please.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, what does \u201cas humane a way as possible\u201d actually mean?\u00a0 Does it mean civilians?\u00a0 Or \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re going to have to see.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have to define that as we go along.\u00a0 They want to \u2014 if you listen to Erdo\u011fan, he wants to have people go back to where they came from, go back to Syria.\u00a0 Right now, he\u2019s holding \u2014 in all fairness to him, he\u2019s holding millions of people that would be all over the place if he wasn\u2019t holding them.\u00a0 So he wants to repatriate, he wants to have them go back into the area that he\u2019s looking at.\nBut we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see how he does it.\u00a0 He can do it in a soft manner.\u00a0 He can do it in a very tough manner.\u00a0 And if he does it unfairly, he\u2019s going to pay a very big economic price.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, you said \u2014 with the letter that you sent up to Nancy Pelosi yesterday \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 you appeared to declare war on the impeachment inquiry.\u00a0 Can you tell us, in your own words, why you think it is incumbent upon the House to hold a full vote to authorize an inquiry?\u00a0 And if they were to hold the vote and it were to be positive, would you then cooperate with the inquiry?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, let me just say that the Republican Party \u2014 and President \u2014 but the Republican Party has been treated extremely badly by the Democrats \u2014 very unfairly \u2014 because they have a tiny margin in the House.\u00a0 They have eviscerated the rules.\u00a0 They don\u2019t give us any \u2014 any fair play.\u00a0 It\u2019s the most unfair situation people have seen.\u00a0 No lawyers \u2014 you can\u2019t have lawyers.\u00a0 You can\u2019t speak.\u00a0 You can\u2019t do anything.\u00a0 You virtually can\u2019t do anything.\nAnd then, on top of it, they have a guy named Schiff.\u00a0 And Nancy Pelosi knows all this because she\u2019s just as guilty as he is.\u00a0 But you have a man named Schiff, where I had a perfect phone call with the President of Ukraine \u2014\u00a0like, I mean perfect.\u00a0 People read it, but they don\u2019t read that.\u00a0 They heard Schiff\u2019s version of it.\u00a0 He defrauded the American public.\u00a0 He gave the most horrible rendition, adding his own words.\nI mean, Mark Meadows is here.\u00a0 I think I can say honestly, Mark, you didn\u2019t believe it when you heard it.\nREPRESENTATIVE MEADOWS:\u00a0 Right.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And Mark has never heard anything like it. And many of the people that we work with, including Democrats, have never heard anything like it.\u00a0 He made up a phone call.\u00a0 He made it up.\u00a0 Because what happened is they spoke about a day too early.\u00a0 They heard a whistleblower who came out with a false story \u2014 you know, people say, \u201cOh, it was always fairly close.\u201d\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t close at all.\u00a0 What the whistleblower said bore no relationship to what the call was.\u00a0 We have a transcribed call, done by professionals.\u00a0 And the call was a perfect call, but Schiff made it up.\nThen it turns out that the whistleblower was in cahoots with Schiff.\u00a0 Then it turns out that the whistleblower is a Democrat \u2014 strong Democrat \u2014 and is working with one of my opponents as a Democrat that I might end up running against.\u00a0 The whole thing is a scam.\u00a0 It\u2019s a fix.\nAnd we wrote a letter yesterday, and it probably ends up being a big Supreme Court case; maybe it goes a long time.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 But the Republican Party has been treated unbelievably badly and unfairly by the Democrats, John.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But then again, sir, if they held a vote in the full House, and the vote were to authorize, would you \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, yeah, that sounds okay.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 would you cooperate?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we would if they give us our rights. It depends.\u00a0 If they vote and say you can\u2019t have lawyers, you can\u2019t ask questions, you can\u2019t have anybody present \u2014 all of these crazy things.\u00a0 And even some of the reporters said to me, \u201cIt really is an unfair situation.\u201d\nThey ask all the questions and then \u2014 for instance, the ambassador who testified was a fine gentleman.\u00a0 He gave great testimony for us.\u00a0 But we don\u2019t get to do any of that or show any of that, so they brought out only the couple of negative things, all which were knocked out by his other statements.\u00a0 It was a great witness for us, but if you would\u2019ve listened to them, you would\u2019ve said it was a better witness for them.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t even close.\u00a0 He was a fine gentleman.\u00a0 And we saw that, and we said that\u2019s very unfair.\nYes.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, there were reports this afternoon that the Chinese are lowering their expectations for a trade deal.\u00a0 Are you also lowering your expectations for a trade deal?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I don\u2019t think so.\u00a0 I think they feel that I\u2019m driving a tough bargain.\u00a0 But I have to.\u00a0 You know it better than anybody.\u00a0 You do a good job over there.\u00a0 I watch a lot.\nWe are so far down, in terms of where we started, from Presidents that didn\u2019t do their job for many years.\u00a0 Since the World Trade Organization founding \u2014 China went in in 2001 or so \u2014 China went in and just ripped off the world.\nSo, and I told that to President Xi.\u00a0 I said, \u201cYou know, this can\u2019t be like a 50/50 deal.\u201d\u00a0 Because a 50/50 deal, you\u2019re like up there and we\u2019re down here.\u00a0 So a 50/50 deal, it doesn\u2019t work, right?\u00a0 You got to have a little balance.\u00a0 This has to be a better deal from our standpoint.\u00a0 And I think they fully understand it.\nOne of the really good meetings I had today was with our people on opioids and drugs and fentanyl \u2014 and fentanyl, in particular, with respect to your question.\u00a0 And they said that Chinese leadership has a lot of respect for our President, and they are really being much more careful.\u00a0 It\u2019s a much different situation.\nWe have some great drug numbers.\u00a0 Now, what is great drug \u2014 if you\u2019re down 15, 16, 20, 25 percent, it\u2019s still horrible what\u2019s going on in this country and in the world.\u00a0 In the whole world, it\u2019s horrible.\nBut no, I think they have a lot of respect for us.\u00a0 It\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve ever respected us.\u00a0 I think China has a lot of respect for me and for our country and for what we\u2019re doing, and I think they can\u2019t believe what they\u2019ve gotten away with for so many years.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are the Chinese wrong to be putting pressure on the NBA, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, the NBA is a different thing.\u00a0 I mean, I watch this guy, Steve Kerr, and he was like a little boy.\u00a0 He was so scared to be even answering the question.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t answer the question.\u00a0 He was shaking.\u00a0 \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0 He didn\u2019t know how to answer the question.\u00a0 And yet, he\u2019ll talk about the United States very badly.\nI watched Popovich.\u00a0 Sort of the same thing, but he didn\u2019t look quite as scared, actually.\u00a0 But they talk badly about the United States.\u00a0 But when it talks about China, they don\u2019t want to say anything bad.\u00a0 I thought it was pretty sad, actually.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So are you okay with the Chinese government pressuring the NBA, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It\u2019ll be \u2014 it\u2019ll be very \u2014 it\u2019ll be very interesting. \u00a0Excuse me.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you okay then with the Chinese government pressuring the NBA over Hong Kong?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 They have to work out their own situation.\u00a0 The NBA is \u2014 they know what they\u2019re doing.\u00a0 But I watch the way that like Kerr and Popovich and some of the others were pandering to China, and yet to our country, they don\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s like they don\u2019t respect it.\u00a0 It\u2019s like they don\u2019t respect it.\nI said, \u201cWhat a difference.\u00a0 Isn\u2019t it sad?\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s very sad.\u00a0 To me, it\u2019s very sad.\nJohn.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, Joe Biden came out for the first time today and said you should be impeached.\u00a0 Your response?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, he\u2019s falling like a rock.\u00a0 We have him on tape with corruption.\u00a0 I mean, he\u2019s getting the prosecutor for, I guess, John, it was $2 billion \u2014 saying, \u201cWe\u2019re not giving you the $2 billion\u201d \u2014 or whatever the amount was \u2014 \u201cunless you get rid of this prosecutor.\u201d\u00a0 And then he goes, \u201cLo and behold, the prosecutor was gone.\u201d\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was $1.2 billion.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And that was the prosecutor \u2014 excuse me, John?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 $1.2 billion.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 $1.2 billion.\u00a0 Not a lot of money.\u00a0 And then his son takes out $1.5 billion from China.\nAnd, by the way, the $50,000 a month that he was getting from Ukraine, it looks like it\u2019s $168,000, split among him and somebody else \u2014 his friend.\u00a0 And also there\u2019s a payment of about $3 million to his son.\u00a0 His son just got thrown out of the Navy.\nSo Biden is dropping like a rock.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to make it.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t think he wasn\u2019t going to make it for a long time.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to make it.\u00a0 And I guess this is one way he can do it.\u00a0 You know, he didn\u2019t say that until right now.\u00a0 And he sees what\u2019s happening to him.\u00a0 I guess he\u2019s no longer the frontrunner.\nBut, look, I feel badly for him because I know he\u2019s going through a lot.\u00a0 He\u2019s been hit.\u00a0 And he\u2019s been caught red-handed.\u00a0 I mean, here\u2019s a man who is on tape saying exactly what he\u2019s going to do in terms of corruption, and he gets away with it.\u00a0 If that ever happened to a Republican, they\u2019d be getting the electric chair right now.\u00a0 They\u2019d be right now being walked into the electric chair.\u00a0 It\u2019s a whole different standard.\nWhat Joe Biden said on tape \u2014 this isn\u2019t like, \u201cGee-whiz, we think.\u201d\u00a0 What he said on tape \u2014 and the fake media doesn\u2019t want to play the tape.\u00a0 They hardly play it.\u00a0 So I feel, you know, that it\u2019s too bad what\u2019s happened to him.\u00a0 He is sinking and his campaign is sinking.\nBut he walked away with hundreds of \u2014 I mean, you look at the kind of numbers his son \u2014 who is, at best, incompetent \u2014 got thrown out of the Navy.\u00a0 I don\u2019t even want to say why; A subject that we just discussed.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to say why.\u00a0 But he gets thrown \u2014 and then all of a sudden, he\u2019s making a deal with Ukraine, where they\u2019re getting $168,000 a month between the two of them \u2014 $168,000 \u2014 and he gets $3 million payments and all of this money coming out?\u00a0 And the kid has no expertise in energy, and it\u2019s an energy company.\u00a0 He has no expertise.\u00a0 You and I both know much more than he does, John.\nAnd then you walk into China, and a couple of days later \u2014 10 days later, to be exact \u2014 he gets $1.5 billion out of China, and he\u2019s got no expertise.\u00a0 And I have friends that are the smartest people on Wall Street.\u00a0 I said, \u201cIs that possible?\u201d\u00a0 They say, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not possible.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s a pretty sad situation.\nPlease.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, I just want to clarify something you said earlier.\u00a0 If Pelosi holds a vote on the floor on impeachment and commits to the rules of previous impeachment proceedings, you\u2019ll participate in that investigation?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah, if the rules are fair.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Okay.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I \u2014 because I don\u2019t know how \u2014 I don\u2019t know exactly your definition.\nIf Republicans get a fair shake \u2014 because the Republicans have been \u2014 look, we were very nice to them.\u00a0 When Paul Ryan was the Speaker, he really wouldn\u2019t give subpoenas.\u00a0 And I\u2019m not saying good, bad, or indifferent.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a man that knows it very well.\u00a0 They\u2019d go in with all of the corruption that you\u2019ve been reading about, and all of the things that they did wrong with Comey, and all of these people and all of the things they did wrong.\nWhen we wanted a subpoena \u2014 meaning, they wanted a subpoena \u2014 it was very hard to get it and I\u2019m not sure he ever even issued a subpoena.\u00a0 And Nancy Pelosi issues subpoenas: \u201cCome on in and get them.\u201d\u00a0 Gives them to Nadler.\u00a0 Gives them to Crooked Schiff.\nI mean, this Schiff is one crooked guy.\u00a0 The guy made up my phone call.\u00a0 Think of it.\u00a0 In the United States Congress, he made up my phone call.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve had people that said, \u201cI didn\u2019t like the way you talked to the Ukrainian President.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cDid you read my speech?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo, I heard Schiff.\u201d\u00a0 Shifty Schiff.\u00a0 \u201cI heard Schiff.\u201d\u00a0 I said \u2014 that\u2019s how I said \u2014 I said, \u201cWell, let me see what he said.\u201d\u00a0 A lot of people saw that.\nThis \u2014 and frankly, I think if it wasn\u2019t for me, I don\u2019t know if anybody would have even noticed and called him out.\u00a0 He took my really \u2014 believe it or not \u2014 congenial and gentle words, and he made me sound like a tyrant.\u00a0 It\u2019s a terrible thing.\u00a0 He defrauded the American public.\nI mean, honestly, I don\u2019t know what can happen, but there are those that say he should be prosecuted for what he did.\u00a0 He should certainly be impeached, but he should be prosecuted for what he did.\u00a0 And I think he\u2019s a very bad leader of this movement.\nYes, please.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And just, on the phone call, there\u2019s a new report out today that the whistleblower says a White House official came to him and said you committed a crime on that call.\u00a0 Did any White House official express any concern to you \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, no.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 or speak to you about that phone call afterward?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It\u2019s all a big con, don\u2019t you understand?\u00a0 Look, the phone call, you have it; it\u2019s the transcript.\u00a0 That\u2019s why they keep saying, \u201cOh, the whistleblower said this and that.\u201d\u00a0 What happened is, if they would have seen the transcript early, they wouldn\u2019t have had a whistleblower, because he wouldn\u2019t have said \u2014 there was nothing he could say.\u00a0 All you have to do is read the transcript.\u00a0 Very calm.\nAnd what\u2019s even more important than the transcript, in a certain way?\u00a0 Although, I think the transcript is the most important, because it was really plain vanilla.\u00a0 No emotion.\u00a0 No nothing.\nThese are crooked people that are doing \u2014 these are Democrats, headed by a \u2014 a Democrat lawyer, a big Democrat lawyer.\u00a0 This is a con job.\u00a0 This is a con being perpetrated on the United States public and even the world.\u00a0 And the world is watching, and they \u2014 they get it better than a lot of other people.\u00a0 It\u2019s very interesting.\nBut a poll just came out today: A very small people want to see something \u2014 even though I only get negative press from you people \u2014 not you, necessarily.\u00a0\u00a0 But \u2014 but, that\u2019s the way it is.\nSo, I say this: Look, all you have to do is read the transcript.\u00a0 But you know what\u2019s almost as good as the transcript, I think?\u00a0 Is the Ukrainian President saying \u2014 he didn\u2019t even know that they were talking about \u2014 \u201cno pressure.\u201d\u00a0 The foreign minister of Ukraine saying, \u201cNo, it was a very normal call.\u00a0 There was no pressure at all.\u201d\nWhat is bad is when you see all of the elements, when you see that Schiff saw the whistleblower.\u00a0 When you see what the whistleblower said about the phone call, and it was totally different.\u00a0 He made it up.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t know why a person that defrauds the American public should be protected, okay?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, then why did your administration try to bury that transcript in the extra level of \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, that I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 Again, I\u2019m not a lawyer.\u00a0 I can say this: I assume it was for leaks.\u00a0 I have no idea.\u00a0 I\u2019m just answering.\u00a0 Because this city is like the leaking capital of the world.\u00a0 If you want to get something out to the press, all you have to do is hand it to somebody in Washington.\nSo, I assume it was for leaks.\u00a0 I mean, I\u2019ve read that, and it doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal.\u00a0 What is a big deal \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think they\u2019re probably trying to protect it from leaks.\nBut here\u2019s the other thing: We gave that transcript over almost immediately.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t like we waited until now.\u00a0 Until now would be immediately, because it\u2019s only been doing it for three weeks.\u00a0 We gave that transcript up almost immediately.\nAnd you know, when I heard Schiff\u2019s phony version, and when I heard what was being horribly said by this so-called whistleblower \u2014 and I\u2019d like to find who is the person in between the whistleblower and hearing about this \u2014 the conversation?\u00a0 The conversation was, I think, a perfect conversation.\u00a0 But who\u2019s the person giving this information?\nIf that person exists \u2014 I\u2019m not sure that person exists \u2014 but I think it\u2019s important \u2014 and I say this to Congress \u2014 I think it\u2019s important to find out who that person is, because we could have a spy.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t want to have spies when I\u2019m negotiating with China and Syria and all of the countries \u2014 if you look at Turkey, with Erdo\u011fan.\u00a0 I have calls with all these people.\u00a0 And Kim Jong Un.\nI don\u2019t want to have spies in the White House.\u00a0 I want to be free to make calls.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that somebody interprets a call.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t interpret it wrong; I don\u2019t mind a misinterpretation.\u00a0 This was a fraud, because that call was perfect.\u00a0 And if you read the whistleblower\u2019s report, that was no \u2014 it bore no resemblance to what the call was.\nSteve?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Could we go back to your conversation with Boris Johnson?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There was a case involving a car crash involving a \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I hate the case.\u00a0 I \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 American diplomat\u2019s wife.\u00a0 Did you bring \u2014\u00a0 did you talk about that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s true.\u00a0 I \u2014 we talked about it.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What did you decide?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So, what we\u2019re going to do \u2014 it\u2019s a very, very complex issue, as you know, because we\u2019re talking about diplomatic immunity, which, in itself, is quite a subject, right?\u00a0 You people could lecture me on it, I suspect.\u00a0 But it\u2019s quite a subject.\nA terrible accident occurred.\u00a0 The person driving the car \u2014 they know who it was, and they have it on camera.\u00a0 A young man was killed on his motorcycle.\u00a0 He was killed \u2014 sounds like instantly killed.\nThe woman, through diplomatic immunity, left the UK, and came back to America.\u00a0 And what I\u2019m going to try and do and see \u2014 because I understand where the people from the UK are.\u00a0 And, frankly, a lot of Americans feel the same way.\u00a0 We have \u2014 I was telling Boris, we have a lot of Americans that, you know, they side on the fact that, you know, you have two wonderful parents that lost their son, and the woman was driving on the wrong side of the road.\nAnd that can happen.\u00a0 You know, those are the opposite roads.\u00a0 That happens.\u00a0 I won\u2019t say it ever happened to me, but it did.\u00a0 When you get used to driving on our system and then you\u2019re all of a sudden in the other system, where you\u2019re driving \u2014 it happens.\u00a0 Have to be careful \u2014 very careful.\nSo a young man was killed, the person that was driving the automobile has diplomatic immunity.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to speak to her very shortly and see if we can do something where they meet \u2014 it was an accident.\u00a0 It was an acc- \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Like send her back?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It was a terrible accident.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Send her back, you mean, for trial?\u00a0 Or \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We\u2019re going to speak to her and we\u2019re going to see the person driving the car \u2014 the wife of the diplomat.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to speak to her and see what we can come up with so that there can be some healing.\u00a0 There\u2019s tremendous anger over it.\u00a0 It\u2019s a terrible incident.\u00a0 There\u2019s tremendous anger, and I understand the anger from the other side very much.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, when you met with Robert Mueller in May of 2017 at the Oval Office, were you in fact interviewing him for the position of FBI?\u00a0 And were you aware, at the time that he was in the Oval Office, that he had had prior conversations with Rod Rosenstein about potentially becoming Special Counsel?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Okay, to you second question: Absolutely not.\u00a0 I had no idea that he was doing that.\u00a0 To the first question, he absolutely wanted to become the FBI Director, and I said, \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cListen, you\u2019ve been there for\u2026\u201d \u2014 I believe it was 12 years.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0 And it has since been proven that I was right.\u00a0 Plus, we have witnesses to it.\u00a0 I interviewed numerous people that day.\u00a0 And he was one of the numerous people.\u00a0 Making a decision ultimately \u2014 but he was one of the people.\u00a0 I said no \u2014 nicely, respectfully.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did you speak to him about a potential conflict of interest because of the dispute he had with you over the golf membership?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I knew about it.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t speak about that, because I wasn\u2019t going to accept him.\u00a0 That may have been one of the reasons I said no.\u00a0 Who knows?\u00a0 But I did have conflicts of interest with Robert Mueller.\u00a0 We had a business dispute.\u00a0 I thought we had, as you know, three basic conflicts of interest, and none of them were very good.\u00a0 But we had a \u2014 we had a business dispute.\nBut I thought he was there for 12 years.\u00a0 That was long enough, especially when you saw what happened with the FBI.\nAnd you have to understand, nobody respects the FBI more than do.\u00a0 And I think, if you took a vote in the EBI, they\u2019d vote me President right now \u2014 a vast, vast majority.\u00a0 And they\u2019re great people.\u00a0 I know a lot of them.\u00a0 But your leadership was terrible, whether it was Comey or Mueller or anybody.\nI mean, this leadership turned out to be a disaster for this country, when you look at Strzok and Page, when you look at the \u201cinsurance policy.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYou know, she\u2019s going to win.\u00a0 But just in case she doesn\u2019t, we have an insurance policy.\u201d\u00a0 Well, that only means one thing; there\u2019s no other interpretation.\nSo when you look at that \u2014 no, Robert Mueller wanted a job to be the Director, and I turned him \u2014 very nicely, respectfully \u2014 down.\u00a0 The other element of your question: I never \u2014 I never heard that until just recently when it\u2019s being reported a little bit.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So these trade \u2014 the trade talks \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Please.\u00a0 Go ahead, Steve.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 coming up with China: Are you optimistic that some sort of deal will be reached with these \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, China wants to make a deal.\u00a0 In my opinion, China wants to make a deal more than I do, okay?\u00a0 But \u2014 but \u2014 look, I\u2019m very happy right now.\u00a0 We\u2019re taking in billions of dollars of tariffs.\u00a0 And despite what the news was saying, there\u2019s no inflation.\u00a0 There\u2019s not a very big price increase, if any, because they\u2019ve eaten the tariffs.\u00a0 They\u2019ve devalued their currency and they\u2019re pouring a lot of money into their system.\nNow, they\u2019ve lost three and a half million jobs and their chain is breaking up; their supply chain is breaking up like a broken egg.\u00a0 They want to make a deal.\nThe question is: Do I want to make a deal?\u00a0 And the answer would be, if we make the right deal, I\u2019d love to do it.\u00a0 I think it would be a great thing for China, also.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But they seem to be reluctant to make concessions on IP and (inaudible) \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 I mean, you don\u2019t know that.\u00a0 Look, there is so many false reports. Everybody is trying to guess.\u00a0 But there\u2019s really only two people that matter on this one, and that\u2019s President Xi and myself.\u00a0 We get along very well.\nI can\u2019t imagine he likes me the way he did when I first became President, because, you know, it\u2019s been \u2014 it\u2019s been a rough time for China.\u00a0 China has gone down many trillions of dollars and we\u2019ve gone up many trillions of dollars.\u00a0 I mean, we\u2019ve \u2014 since I\u2019ve been elected, many, many, many trillions of dollars have been \u2014 increased the value of \u2014 if you call it \u201cvalue\u201d; you could call it \u201cworth\u201d or \u201cvalue\u201d \u2014 of our country.\u00a0 We\u2019ve you\u2019ve increased \u2014 not just stock market, I\u2019m talking our country.\u00a0 Our economy is bigger.\u00a0 It\u2019s stronger.\nAnd I believe if my opponent got in, you would have had a tremendous slide.\u00a0 And don\u2019t forget, I only look at our numbers from the day after the election, because there was euphoria when I got elected and we picked up a tremendous amount from, let\u2019s say, the 9th of November to January 20th, when we had the inauguration.\u00a0 And it\u2019s been that way ever sense.\u00a0 It\u2019s been a fantastic thing.\nBut China wants to make a deal very badly.\u00a0 And if we can make a deal, we\u2019re going to make a deal.\u00a0 There\u2019s a really good chance.\u00a0 There\u2019s a really good chance, Steve.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have you spoken \u2014 have you spoken at all, Mr. President, to the Attorney General about the coming Horowitz Inspector General\u2019s report and/or the Durham report \u2014 either investigation?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I really \u2014 I\u2019m leaving that to the Attorney General \u2014 highly respected man, a very highly principled man.\u00a0 I did read the Comey report \u2014 78 pages of total kill.\u00a0 And I think it says, frankly, a lot to the Attorney General that he decided not to prosecute on that report, because I think most people reading that report would have done that.\u00a0 That report was horrible for Comey.\u00a0 Horrible.\u00a0 But he\u2019s a highly principled man, and I\u2019m leaving it up to him.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, can you tell us what you said to President Erdo\u011fan on Sunday when he said to you \u2014 did you promise him anything or did he promise you anything on Sunday?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, we\u2019re talking about it.\u00a0 No.\u00a0 But he said, \u201cI want to go in.\u00a0 I want to go in.\u201d\u00a0 But he\u2019s been telling me that for two and a half years.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And did you agree to that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 He\u2019s been telling that, virtually \u2014 he\u2019s been saying this for many years, before me.\u00a0 And, you know, he\u2019s ready to do it.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been, again, fighting for so long.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been fighting for so many \u2014 these are \u2014 this is like Israel and the Palestinians, okay?\u00a0 There\u2019s only one difference: maybe the hatred is even greater.\u00a0 Is that possible?\u00a0 Maybe not.\u00a0 But it\u2019s \u2014 this is a very, very serious hatred that\u2019s come over many years.\nYes, sir.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But, Mr. President, the Kurds helped the U.S. defeat ISIS.\u00a0 And, by allowing this offensive, is it going to be more difficult in future times of need to develop alliances?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, it won\u2019t be.\u00a0 It won\u2019t be at all.\u00a0 Alliances are very easy.\nBut, you know, our alliances have taken advantage of us.\u00a0 If you look at how much money we spent on NATO and how much money countries from Europe \u2014 who are really a much bigger beneficiary that we are, okay?\u00a0 You know, they\u2019re there and we\u2019re here.\u00a0 We\u2019re many miles away.\u00a0 Our alliances, in many cases, have taken tremendous advantage of us.\nIf you look at NATO, I got them to pay $100 billion more.\u00a0 The Secretary-General, Stoltenberg, came out with a report recently that, because of President Trump, the other countries \u2014 28 countries \u2014 so 27, not including us \u2014 they paid over $100 billion more because of me.\u00a0 But still, as good as that is \u2014 sounds good \u2014 it\u2019s nothing compared to the kind of numbers you\u2019re talking about.\nSo I\u2019m very happy with that, but the United States is paying over 4 percent and Germany is paying 1 percent \u2014 maybe a tiny bit more, but I actually think, the way you calculate it \u2014 because you can look at it many ways \u2014 is probably less than 1 percent.\u00a0 France is paying less than what they\u2019re supposed to.\nOut of the 28 countries, 20 of them are delinquent.\u00a0 You know what the \u201cdelinquent\u201d means?\u00a0 That\u2019s an old real estate term.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s delinquent with his rent.\u201d\u00a0 They\u2019re delinquent with their payment.\u00a0 They owe us a tremendous amount of money and they never pay us back.\nBecause if Germany doesn\u2019t pay \u2014 they don\u2019t add that up, they just say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s okay.\u201d\u00a0 Then they don\u2019t pay.\u00a0 And yet, they\u2019re \u2014 if you go back that way, like the old fashioned way \u2013like you don\u2019t pay and you owe it.\u00a0 But they don\u2019t pay and they just go on to the next year.\u00a0 They owe us hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars.\u00a0 So, no.\u00a0 I don\u2019t look at it that way.\nNow, the Kurds are fighting for their land, just so you understand.\u00a0 They\u2019re fighting for their land.\u00a0 And, as somebody wrote in a very, very powerful article today, they didn\u2019t help us in the Second World War.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t help us with Normandy, as an example.\u00a0 They mentioned names of different battles.\u00a0 They were there, but they\u2019re there to help us with their land.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a different thing.\nIn addition to that, we have spent tremendous amounts of money on helping the Kurds \u2014 in terms of ammunition, in terms of weapons, in terms of money, in terms of pay.\u00a0 With all of that being said, we like the Kurds.\nNow you have different factions in there.\u00a0 Again, you have PKK \u2014 that\u2019s a different faction.\u00a0 And they worked with us.\u00a0 It\u2019s a rough group, but they worked with us.\u00a0 But we\u2019ve spent a tremendous \u2014 and they\u2019re fighting for their lands.\u00a0 So when you say, \u201cThey\u2019re fighting with us\u201d \u2014 yes, but they\u2019re fighting for their land.\nNow, if we go on the theory that some of the folks in Washington go by \u2014 who all do very well with the military-industrial complex.\u00a0 I mean, you know, the military-industrial complex.\u00a0 Take a look at Dwight Eisenhower; he had it figured right many years ago.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s got tremendous power.\u00a0 They like fighting.\u00a0 They make a lot of money when they fight.\nBut it was time to bring our soldiers back home.\u00a0 So I see \u2014 and I will tell you: The hardest thing I have to do, by far, much harder than the witch hunt, is signing letters to parents of soldiers that have been killed.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not only that \u2014 in areas where there\u2019s not a lot of upside, if there\u2019s any upside at all, and in many cases, it\u2019s only downside.\nAnd especially when that solider was killed in a Blue-on-Green attack. \u00a0You know what that is, right?\u00a0 That\u2019s where a solider being trained or whatever turns his gun on an American solider.\u00a0 \u201cHere, son.\u00a0 Take your gun.\u00a0 You know how to use it.\u201d\nAnd he takes the gun and he turns it.\u00a0 And he shoots one \u2014 we have many of them in Afghanistan \u2014 in particular, in Afghanistan.\nThe hardest thing I have to do is signing those letters.\u00a0 That\u2019s the hardest thing I have to do.\u00a0 And each letter is different.\u00a0 We make each letter different.\u00a0 And last week, I signed of them for Afghanistan; one in Iraq; one in Syria, from two weeks ago.\u00a0 And sometimes I call the parents.\u00a0 Sometimes I see the parents.\u00a0 I go to Dover, when I can, but it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s so devastating for the parents that \u2014 you know.\u00a0 It\u2019s so devastating when they bring that boy or young woman out of the back of those big, powerful planes in a coffin, and the parents are there.\nYou know, we have people that do that.\u00a0 That\u2019s what they do.\u00a0 They \u2014 they work that.\u00a0 They accommodate everybody.\u00a0 That\u2019s what they do.\u00a0 They an incredible job.\u00a0 And they said \u2014 I said, \u201cThe parents seemed to be okay.\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019ll get there early.\u00a0 \u201cThe parents seemed to be okay.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWell, actually, sir, they aren\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo, no.\u00a0 The way they\u2019re talking.\u00a0 They\u2019re really okay, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cSir, you never know until the back of that massive cargo plane opens up.\u201d\u00a0 And they walk down holding a coffin with four or five great soldiers on each side of it, representing our various forces.\u00a0 That you never know.\nAnd then I see it.\u00a0 And I see people that were smiling, \u201cOh, Mr. President, thank you for being here.\u00a0 Thank you for being here.\u201d\u00a0 And I think they\u2019re doing great.\u00a0 And then, twenty minutes later, we\u2019ll be outside when that big plane pulls up and that door comes down, and they are walking the coffin with their boy inside this coffin with an American flag over the top.\u00a0 And they\u2019re walking that coffin down this ramp.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve seen people that I thought were really incredible the way they were ta- \u2014 I didn\u2019t even understood how they could take it so well \u2014 scream, like I\u2019ve never seen anything before.\u00a0 Sometimes they\u2019ll run to the coffin.\u00a0 They\u2019ll break through military barriers.\u00a0 They\u2019ll run to the coffin and jump on top of the coffin.\u00a0 Crying mothers and wives.\u00a0 Crying desperately.\nAnd this is on these endless wars that just never stop.\u00a0 And there\u2019s a time and there\u2019s a place, but it\u2019s time to stop.\nAnd just to finish, last Friday, I went to Walter Reed.\u00a0 And I gave out five Purple Hearts to incredible young men \u2014 in this case, all men.\u00a0 And they took a beating.\u00a0 Beautiful people.\u00a0 They took a beating.\u00a0 One couldn\u2019t be there because the beating was so great that he was at a totally different part of the world.\u00a0 He lost a leg.\u00a0 He lost an arm.\u00a0 Ryan.\u00a0 He had tremendous damage, beyond even what these young folks went through.\nBut I\u2019ll tell you what: For me, it\u2019s very hard when I see that.\u00a0 It\u2019s very hard.\u00a0 It\u2019s easy to talk tough.\u00a0 You know, tough guys.\u00a0 All of these tough guys.\u00a0 \u201cLet\u2019s keep fighting.\u00a0 Let\u2019s keep fighting.\u201d\u00a0 If they had to go to Walter Reed \u2014 where they do unbelievable work.\u00a0 I have to tell you, these doctors are unbelievable.\u00a0 You know, it\u2019s easy to say, \u201cOh, they\u2019re not the\u2026\u201d\u00a0 They\u2019re the best in the world.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\nOne young man, last week, had his nose rebuilt.\u00a0 And they said it was in a thousand pieces.\u00a0 And, I said, \u201cSo where were you hurt?\u201d\u00a0 He said, \u201cMy face, sir, was almost obliterated.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cYou have a better face than I do.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And he said, \u201cSir, I had a doctor who was unbelievable, and they put it together.\u201d\u00a0 They said \u2014 he said \u201ca thousand fragments.\u201d\u00a0 Now, I don\u2019t if that\u2019s even possible.\u00a0 But a thousand fragments.\u00a0 And they put it together.\nAnd his father, who was crying, came up to me and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe this, but my son didn\u2019t have a great-looking nose and now his nose is better.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 It\u2019s an amazing thing.\nBut when you see these \u2014 and the Purple Hearts \u2014 you see this kind of thing \u2014 and I see a lot of it at Walter Reed.\u00a0 And, again, the job those doctors and the people do at Walter Reed, it\u2019s something to be commended.\nThank you all very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEND\n4:39 P.M.

EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 And I want to thank everybody for being here.\u00a0 This is a very special event.\u00a0 Today, it\u2019s my tremendous privilege to present our nation\u2019s highest civilian honor to a absolute titan of American law and a heroic defender of the American Constitution: former Counselor to the President and Attorney General of the United States, Ed Meese.\u00a0 Very special man.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEd, congratulations on receiving a really incredible award.\u00a0 This is something that \u2014 we have the Congressional Medal of Honor and we have the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\u00a0 And this is something that\u2019s very special for me to present it to you.\u00a0 I\u2019ve heard so many incredible things over the years about you.\u00a0 So, congratulations.\u00a0 It\u2019s my honor to be with you.\nWe\u2019re delighted to be joined by Vice President Mike Pence; Attorney General William Barr \u2014 Bill; Acting OMB Director Russ Vought; and Heritage Foundation President Kay Cole James.\u00a0 Hi, Kay.\u00a0 Also \u2014 he did a good job, didn\u2019t he?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Huh?\nAlso with us is Ed\u2019s terrific family: his wife of 61 years, Ursula.\u00a0 Thank you, Ursula.\nMRS. MEESE:\u00a0 You\u2019re welcome.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It\u2019s a long time.\u00a0 Good husband, right?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 He was a good husband.\nMRS. MEESE:\u00a0 First 38 years.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 At least for the first 38 years.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nAlong with his children, grandchildren, and his great grandson, Liam.\u00a0 I know you.\u00a0 Huh?\u00a0 (Laughter.) \u00a0He grabbed me.\u00a0 I said, \u201cI like this guy.\u201d\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Thank you for being here.\nEd Meese was born into a deeply patriotic family committed to public service.\u00a0 His father worked in local government for five decades, including many years as police court clerk.\u00a0 His dad\u2019s stories of \u2014 I mean, and he had some incredible stories, from what I was told.\u00a0 His stories of serving the people of Oakland inspired Ed\u2019s lifetime of passion.\u00a0 And his law enforcement career was unparalleled.\nAfter graduating from Yale in 1953, Ed attended the University of California at Berkeley Law School and served two years of active duty in the United States Army.\u00a0 He remained in the Reserves for another two and a half decades, retiring as a Colonel in 1984.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know that, Ed.\u00a0 That was pretty good, right?\nEd married Ursula, the love of his life, in 1958.\u00a0 And they wanted me to say that, and he meant it.\u00a0 Truly, the love of his life.\u00a0 That\u2019s a beautiful thing.\nHe then became Deputy District Attorney of Alameda County, California, the same county where he had grown up.\u00a0 He regularly rode with local police on patrol.\u00a0 One officer later said about Ed, \u201cFinding someone around here who doesn\u2019t like Ed Meese is like trying to find a four-year-old who doesn\u2019t like Santa Claus.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So, in other words, he was a popular guy.\nWhen chaos and violence broke out on the campus of UC Berkeley, Ed was instrumental in restoring order, peace, and public safety.\nIn 1966, still the deputy district attorney of his native county, Ed was introduced to Governor-elect Ronald Reagan for the first time.\u00a0 At the end of a 30-minute one-on-one meeting, the new governor offered Ed a job.\u00a0 He said, \u201cThis guy has the potential to be great.\u201d\nEd joined the administration as Legal Affairs Secretary and quickly earned Governor Reagan\u2019s trust.\u00a0 Just two years later, he became Chief of Staff.\u00a0 In that position, Ed worked tirelessly to serve the people of California.\u00a0 He helped negotiate the first major welfare reform in the nation, fought for the Governor\u2019s legislative priority, and helped propel Ronald Reagan onto a national stage.\u00a0 And it was a stage that was a truly great one; he became a great President.\nAfter Governor Reagan narrowly lost the 1976 presidential primary campaign, Ed joined the faculty of San Diego University Law School and became the founding director of its Center for Criminal Justice Policy and Management.\nIn 1980, Ed became a key leader in Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidential campaign.\u00a0 And Ed knew that was going to happen; it was just a question of time.\u00a0 After Reagan\u2019s victory that November, he oversaw the presidential transition.\nIn the new administration, Ed was appointed Counselor to the President and was the only White House staff member included in President Reagan\u2019s Cabinet.\u00a0 In that position, he drove sweeping reforms of the executive branch and ensured the departments worked together to achieve the administration\u2019s goals.\u00a0 And he was a star.\nEd was among President Reagan\u2019s closest advisors as the administration implemented tax cuts, a dramatic defense build-up, and a relentless campaign to defeat communism.\u00a0 Ed helped spearhead an initiative to fight organized crime and public corruption, supported a task force on victims of crime, and chaired the first White House meeting on missile defense that led to the Strategic Defense Initiative \u2014 a strategy that helped win the Cold War.\nIn 1984, President Reagan nominated Ed Meese to be Attorney General.\u00a0 We have our Attorney General with us, and he\u2019s also doing a great job, I will tell you that.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn the course of a grueling nomination process, he showed incredible grace and grit.\u00a0 The Democrats tried to derail his nomination, but Ed stayed strong.\u00a0 And after 13 months, he was finally confirmed.\u00a0 That sounds like the kind of things we go through.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 You know, if you get \u2014 if you win by one vote today, it\u2019s like considered a landslide.\u00a0 That sounds no different.\u00a0 Boy, things don\u2019t change very much, do they?\u00a0 Do they, Kay?\u00a0 I don\u2019t think so.\nOver the next three years, Ed would deliver monumental change for the American people.\u00a0 As Attorney General, Ed led the battle against drugs.\u00a0 He aggressively targeted traffickers and their assets.\u00a0 He also chaired the National Drug Policy Board and coordinated the administration\u2019s response to the drug crisis.\nIn the years that followed, the strategy proved successful.\u00a0 Between 1982 and 1992, drug use by young adults plummeted by 50 percent nationwide.\u00a0 Would you like to make a comeback?\u00a0 That\u2019s a pretty good number.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 You know, we\u2019ve got it down 18 percent, but I like 50 percent better.\u00a0 But we\u2019re dealing with a whole new set of drugs, unfortunately.\u00a0 It\u2019s getting \u2014 it\u2019s a very tough situation.\nPerhaps Ed\u2019s greatest contribution to American law has been his unwavering advocacy for the legal principle that judges must adhere to the original meaning of the Constitution, setting aside their own personal and political views.\nThrough the decades, Ed has been one of the most eloquent champions for following the Constitution as written.\u00a0 To ensure fidelity to our founding documents, Ed supported the growth of the Federalist Society and worked to confirm supremely qualified judges, including the late, great Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, whose son just became the Secretary \u2014 you know that \u2014 Secretary of Labor.\u00a0 Gene.\u00a0 Just had him in, and it was a great ceremony we had.\nAfter concluding a historic tenure as Attorney General, Ed joined the Heritage Foundation.\u00a0 Over his 30 years at Heritage, he helped create the Foundation\u2019s Legal and Judicial Studies Department, which is now named in his honor.\u00a0 And we\u2019re talking about judges.\u00a0 And I will say, Heritage has been very helpful with us also, as you know.\u00a0 And I just had, on that desk, a little while ago, another six.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll be up to, very soon, about 182 federal judges and 2 Supreme Court judges.\u00a0 That\u2019s not including two Supreme Court.\u00a0 So we really \u2014 (applause) \u2014 we really have made tremendous strides.\u00a0 It\u2019s a number that few people have been able to even come close to.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s great.\u00a0 And we appreciate all the work you\u2019ve done, too, Kay.\nEd has advocated for effective law enforcement against over-criminalization, and is always in defense of the Constitution and the system of government designed by our Founders.\nEd, you are a loyal fighter for freedom, a champion of law and order, mentor to young Americans, and faithful defender of our Republic.\u00a0 You are an inspiration to liberty-loving citizens everywhere.\u00a0 You\u2019re just an inspiration, period.\u00a0 Everybody that knows you uses that word: You\u2019re an inspiration.\u00a0 On behalf of the grateful nation that I love and that we serve, I want to thank you.\u00a0 I want to thank you for your incredible lifetime of exceptional service and of devotion to our country.\nAnd I just want to say to your family that this is an extraordinary man, and I looked at all of your wonderful children and grandchildren and your great-grandson and you.\u00a0 I\u2019m especially talking about you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 You have very good genes.\u00a0 Just remember the President \u2014 you have great genes between the two of them.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 Great genes.\nSo it is now my honor to ask the military aide to come forward and present Edwin Meese III with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Congratulations, Ed.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Ed, I think we may \u2014 we\u2019ll do this first.\u00a0 Okay?\nMILITARY AIDE:\u00a0 Edwin Meese III has long been thought \u2014 a thought leader and strong conservative voice on matters of law and policy.\u00a0 As Counselor to President Ronald Reagan, Mr. Meese helped to craft the foreign policy strong enough to help end the Cold War and played a pivotal role in helping to secure historic tax cuts.\nAs Attorney General, he promoted federalism and the original public understanding of our Constitution.\nSince leaving public service, Edwin Meese has continued to champion our nation\u2019s founding principles through his extensive work at the Heritage Foundation.\nThe United States proudly honors Edwin Meese III, who has dedicated his life to serving our nation and protecting our liberties.\n(The Medal of Freedom is presented.)\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR. MEESE:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 Thank you very much both for this very fine award \u2014 an award which I will cherish, obviously, forever \u2014 but also for the kind words that you gave and what you have mentioned, but particularly for the privilege of being here with you and to have my family here to meet you and also to listen to this particular ceremony.\nIt\u2019s just a great privilege that I appreciate very much, and appreciate all that you have done to make us welcome here, and, as I say, for those kind words.\nI\u2019m also very grateful to the Vice President for being here.\u00a0 Mr. Vice President, you and I have been friends since the day you were in Congress here, not so many years ago.\u00a0 And it was great to have known you and followed your career also.\u00a0 And I think you and the President make one of the finest teams we\u2019ve had in our country.\u00a0 And I\u2019m very grateful particularly to have this award coming from the two of you.\u00a0 And I thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI also want to mention Bill Barr, and I thank you, Bill, for this.\u00a0 You and I started work together in the first term of Ronald Reagan; you were in the Office of Policy Development.\u00a0 And you\u2019ve risen to continue the string of great Attorneys General in this country, and I certainly appreciate what you\u2019re doing now.\u00a0 I must say, from my own experience, I understand what you\u2019re going through now.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So it\u2019s even better to wish you well in the fine work you\u2019re doing.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMr. President, I\u2019m also really honored by the members of your administration who are here today.\u00a0 As I look around, I see so many good friends here.\u00a0 I can\u2019t name them all or it would take up the rest of the afternoon, but so many of them and so many who\u2019ve I\u2019ve appreciated the chance to work with as I look around.\u00a0 And, really, I\u2019m very honored that you would all come out to see this particular ceremony.\nAs I stand here today, I can\u2019t do anything other than to thank and praise God for the opportunities and the blessings that I have received in the course of my life.\u00a0 And, of course, one of the greatest blessings in my life has been wife, as you point out, of over 60 years, who is with me today and who is my best friend, a partner in everything I have done, and a great teammate.\u00a0 Particularly, I attribute to her the handsome family of kids we have here.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nAnd also, to my whole family.\u00a0 Family has been my foundation throughout our married life, and it\u2019s just great to see and to be with all of them today.\u00a0 And, Mr. President, you honor me by allowing them to participate in this particular event.\u00a0 And, you know, it\u2019s just great to know that we have here today four generations of Meeses.\u00a0 And so, it\u2019s a great, great honor to have them here.\nYou spoke about the privilege that I had of working for Ronald Reagan.\u00a0 And I will always be indebted to him not only for the honor he did by having me honored \u2014 or appointed to serve under his leadership for 30 years, from 1967, when I first served, as you pointed out, as his Legal Affairs Secretary, to 1997, when he went into the social \u2014 total security \u2014 total isolation, really.\u00a0 And I had that privilege to work for him in the state of California; here, as you pointed out, obviously in Washington, D.C.; and then following that both in the building of his library and then \u2014 and today, I still have the privilege \u2014 in the Young America\u2019s Foundation, they now have taken over his ranch in Santa Barbara, and I have the privilege of serving as the co-chairman of that Ranch Board of Governors.\u00a0 So Ronald Reagan was a pivotal part of my life, and I am always grateful to him.\nBut, you know, the things that you mentioned \u2014 and you were very kind and generous in all that you said \u2014 the things that you mentioned are something that I could not have done by myself.\u00a0 I was always very lucky to have a team of people that I was able to work with.\u00a0 And over the period of time, I can\u2019t think of better people than anyone could have as teammates and people participating in the work of the United States of America, both obviously in my early days, but particularly over the last 30-some-odd years as I was privileged to work here in Washington, D.C.\nOne person who has been a friend, a counselor, literally, and also a great teammate has been Ken Cribb, who is here today.\u00a0 And he has \u2014 (applause) \u2014 Ken has always been there by my side and giving me excellent advice and help, and, as they say today, always having my back.\u00a0 And I am very grateful, Ken.\nAnother person who was with me \u2014 and who will join me \u2014 in the Department of Justice \u2014 two people, actually, that are here today that I want to mention: One is Mark Levin.\u00a0 This was before he became famous.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\nHe was just kind of a young, mild-young \u2014 you know, easygoing, young man.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And we\u2019re happy to have him here with his wife, Julie.\nAnd a third one was Becky Dunlop who was in the Department of Justice with me and did a terrific job.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 So it\u2019s great to have them.\nAnd, of course, Bob McEwen, who is here, has been an advisor and a helper to me in the conservative movement, and an inspiration, as well as a great teammate.\nAnd then, also, it is great because, as you pointed out when I was privileged \u2014 when I left the government in 19- \u2014 the end of 1988, I was privileged to be asked to join the Heritage family,\u00a0 And under Kay\u2019s leadership, and Kim Holmes, and now today with John Malcolm heading up the legal center, and with Bridgett Wagner, who is here \u2014 Becky was with us there \u2014 we\u2019ve had a \u2014 just had a great time and a great team of people that I was privileged to work with there.\nIt\u2019s been just a great thing for me to have all of these opportunities, as I mentioned earlier.\u00a0 And it\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m very grateful to all of those people that are here.\nI also am grateful to another guest, our pastor, Pastor Bill Barr \u2014 Bill Mann.\u00a0 Bill Mann has been a great spiritual leader for our family, and I\u2019m grateful very much for that.\nI\u2019m just \u2014 as I say, there\u2019s so many things to be grateful for today.\u00a0 And the only thing that I would do, Mr. President, is mention a couple of things that particularly are meaningful to me.\u00a0 You\u2019ve done so many things, but there are three things that have been particularly meaningful.\u00a0 You\u2019ve mentioned one of them, and that it your commitment to the Constitution and your commitment to making sure that it\u2019s interpreted as it actually reads.\u00a0 And for that, you have appointed these outstanding judges now, which is a monument to justice and the rule of law that will last literally \u2014 literally, for decades.\u00a0 And I\u2019m grateful for that.\nThe second thing is your emphasis on religious liberty.\u00a0 Your speech to the United Nations was, I believe, the first by any President to talk about that subject before this august buddy \u2014 body.\u00a0 And there\u2019s no group that needed that encouragement more on that particular subject.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nAnd finally, I am grateful and Ursula is grateful, because of our family, for your support for the Armed Forces of the United States.\u00a0 You have not only given them leadership, you\u2019ve given them the resources they need, but you\u2019ve gone beyond that.\u00a0 You have shown your personal respect for every man and woman in uniform.\u00a0 And that\u2019s something that really is not only good for them, but also for their families so that their families can see the dignity that you appreciate in the work that our military folks are doing.\nAll of these things are very important to us.\u00a0 And as a result, today I couldn\u2019t be happier and I couldn\u2019t be more grateful to any person for what you\u2019ve given us here today.\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you, Ed.\u00a0 That\u2019s so nice.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Beautiful.\nWell, you know, you\u2019re right about Mark; he has become a star.\u00a0 Maybe I\u2019d like to have Mark say a few words and the Attorney General say a few words, and our Vice President say a few words.\u00a0 Could we do that?\u00a0 Come on up first, Mark.\u00a0 Just nice and easy now, Mark.\u00a0 Nice \u2014 (laughter).\u00a0 Good.\nMR. LEVIN:\u00a0 Well, it\u2019s a great honor to be here with two great men, President Trump and Attorney General Meese.\u00a0 And it was an honor to work for you as Special Assistant, then Chief of Staff, through the good, the bad, and the ugly.\nAnd you accomplished many, many things as Attorney General of the United States.\u00a0 And you\u2019ve always been wonderful to my family, you and Ursula.\u00a0 You\u2019re family to us, and you always will be.\u00a0 And this is a great honor, and I can\u2019t think of a better person to receive it.\nAnd, Mr. President, I want to thank you \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 I want to thank you for everything you\u2019re doing for this country.\u00a0 I\u2019ve known two great Presidents: Ronald Reagan and you.\u00a0 And I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through what you\u2019re going through, but I want you to know there\u2019s tens of millions of people who stand with you.\u00a0 So, God bless you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Bill?\u00a0 Mike?\u00a0 Come up.\u00a0 Come up.\u00a0 Please.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 And it really is my great honor to serve alongside this President and to be able to share this moment with you, Attorney General Meese, and with your wonderful family.\nIt is extraordinary to think of the life of consequence that you have lived, coming alongside one American President, but also being there every step of the way as this President brought forward a vision to rebuild our military, revive our economy, reground the courts of this country to constitutional principles of limited government.\nAnd on behalf of the President and on behalf of a grateful nation, it\u2019s my honor to add my congratulations to you on the President Medal of Freedom.\u00a0 Congratulations.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much, everybody.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEND\n5:11 P.M.

EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0Well, thank you very much, everybody.\u00a0 This is a group gathering of very talented people.\u00a0 And somebody was saying before, I think Mark Esper, our new Secretary of Defense \u2014 and, by the way, congratulations.\nSECRETARY ESPER:\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Congratulations on really having done already a really great job.\u00a0 But you were saying this is the first group where just about everybody \u2014 they\u2019re appointed by Trump.\u00a0 And that\u2019s good.\u00a0 That\u2019s good.\u00a0 Just about everybody.\u00a0 So we have the people that we want.\u00a0 We\u2019re very happy with them.\nOur military is in great shape.\u00a0 I want to \u2014 in particular, I want to congratulate Mark for new \u2014 the new boss, right?\u00a0 You\u2019re the new boss.\u00a0 And it\u2019s some somebody that\u2019s respected by everybody in this room and respected by just about everybody outside of this room, I can tell you.\u00a0 So, Joint Chiefs of Staff.\u00a0 The head is \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 it doesn\u2019t get any bigger in your world.\nBut we are having a meeting tonight.\u00a0 We have a meeting now, and then we\u2019re going to the White House and we\u2019re going to have dinner with the wives and families.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to have some very interesting conversation.\nThings are going very well with our military.\u00a0 We\u2019ve spent $2.5 trillion since I\u2019ve been President, and rebuilt our military.\u00a0 When I came in, we were low on ammunition and, as you know, we had jets that didn\u2019t work too well.\u00a0 We had a lot of \u2014 a lot of old planes, and we have now, beautiful new planes, or certainly we have a lot of them coming, but we have a lot of them right now in stock.\nAnd we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re doing things I think that nobody thought was possible.\u00a0 We have had extraordinary relationships with a lot of our allies and, I would say, good relationships with others.\u00a0 But we want fairness, we want \u2014 we want to be treated respectfully.\u00a0 We help a lot of nations, and they are not \u2014 they\u2019re not sometimes there for us.\u00a0 So we want to help the ones that \u2014 that we want, and we want to help the ones that deserve the help.\u00a0 And I think we\u2019ve discussed this at length, all of us.\u00a0 Perhaps there\u2019ll be some changes made, and perhaps not.\u00a0 But we have to be respected as a nation.\nA lot of things are changing.\u00a0 You have some very, very wealthy nations, extremely wealthy nations, where we take care of their military and we take care of their military needs.\u00a0 Nobody can do it better than us.\u00a0 But we are really not being reimbursed for what we\u2019re doing.\nAnd we\u2019re having some very nice talks, very friendly talks.\u00a0 And for the most part, I would say, without exception, people are coming through and they\u2019re saying, \u201cYou know, we have to help out also.\u201d\nSo a lot of very exciting things are happening with our military.\u00a0 We have a great team.\u00a0 This is our team right here.\u00a0 They\u2019re some of the best leaders in the world.\u00a0 I think they\u2019re probably the best leaders in the world.\u00a0 We have the greatest men, we have the greatest women, and we have the greatest equipment.\u00a0 Nobody makes it like we do.\nSo I just want to thank you all.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have a discussion.\u00a0 Then we\u2019re going to go over and have dinner at the White House. And thank you all very much for being here.\u00a0 Appreciate it.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, are you confident that \u2014 are you confident that these gentlemen \u2014 I guess, mostly who are sitting around you \u2014 believe what you\u2019re doing in Syria is the best idea at this point?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019ve been in Syria for a long time.\nAnd it was supposed to be a very short hit, and \u2014 hit on ISIS.\u00a0 But it didn\u2019t work out that way.\u00a0 They never left.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve been there for many, many years.\u00a0 And we are \u2014 we were down to very few soldiers in Syria.\u00a0 We had 50 in the region that you\u2019re talking about \u2014 50 soldiers \u2014 and they\u2019ve been already moved out.\nBut we\u2019ll see what happens with respect to a lot of different things.\u00a0 We\u2019ve told Turkey \u2014 I spoke with President Erdo\u011fan of Turkey, and I said, \u201cGot to treat them good, and you got to take care of ISIS.\u201d\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget, we\u2019ve captured \u2014 we defeated \u2014 this group, largely \u2014 defeated ISIS.\u00a0 One hundred percent of the caliphate.\u00a0 One hundred percent.\u00a0 And we wanted to do 100 percent.\u00a0 I was going to do this nine months ago, and we were not at 100 percent, but we were pretty close.\u00a0 Everyone said, \u201cCan we get to 100 percent?\u201d\u00a0 Now I get to 100 percent, and they say, \u201cWell, maybe we could stay longer.\u201d\u00a0 I say, \u201cWell, when do we get out?\u201d\u00a0 There\u2019s got to be a time we get out.\u00a0 We have to bring our people back home.\nAnd frankly, our great soldiers have been talking about this on the campaign.\u00a0 You go back three years ago and more, and you watch the speeches.\u00a0 We want to bring our soldiers back home.\u00a0 These are the endless wars.\nAnd we\u2019re not fighting; we\u2019re policing, to a large extent.\u00a0 We\u2019re policing in certain areas.\u00a0 We\u2019re not police, we\u2019re \u2014 these are fighters, great fighters; the greatest in the world.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what they do.\nSo I\u2019ve told President Erdo\u011fan \u2014 I hope he\u2019s going to treat everybody with great respect.\u00a0 You have to understand, they\u2019ve been fighting various of the people that we were working with, and they \u2014 Turkey has been fighting them for many years.\u00a0 Somebody said hundreds of years.\u00a0 You had just mentioned to me yesterday, 200 years, maybe more.\nAt some point, we have to bring our people back home.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is it a firm decision, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It\u2019s always a firm decision.\u00a0 Last time I made a firm decision, but \u2014 and I said, \u201cWe\u2019ll do it over a period of time.\u201d\u00a0 We\u2019ve been doing this, actually, over a period of time \u2014 over a very long period of time.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve been working with the people in this room, and our soldiers have been coming back over that period of time.\nI think that one of the very big factors when we defeated ISIS \u2014 we have thousands right now, of ISIS fighters and families.\u00a0 We have family members, wives, children.\u00a0 And many of them come out of Europe, they come out of Germany, they come out of France and other countries of Europe, and I told them, \u201cYou have to take these people back.\u201d\u00a0 You have to take them back, give them trials, do whatever you have to do.\u00a0 And they said, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t want to do that.\u00a0 I said, \u201cWell, you have to do that.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s not fair to the American taxpayers.\u00a0 It\u2019s not fair to America.\u00a0 It\u2019s not fair to the United States not to do that.\u00a0 But they chose not to do it.\u00a0 I said, \u201cAgain, you got to take them back.\u201d\u00a0 We can\u2019t take care of sixty, seventy thousand\u00a0 people.\nAnd we\u2019re not going to move the fighters to Guantanamo Bay and take care of them for many, many years into the future.\u00a0 It\u2019s not for us.\u00a0 We did you a great service, a great favor.\u00a0 We defeated the caliphate 100 percent, and now it\u2019s time for Germany and France, and all of the nations where they came from, to take them back.\u00a0 And they chose no.\u00a0 And maybe they\u2019ll \u2014 maybe they\u2019re going to change their tune now.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\nBut in the meantime, we\u2019ll have to rely on the European nations.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have to rely on various other nations \u2014 as an example, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Russia, and some other nations \u2014 to take care of these fighters.\u00a0 But the American taxpayer is not going to spend 50 years of paying tax, or whatever it may be that they\u2019re \u2014 wherever they may be, for instance, Guantanamo, or, for instance, prisons in the United States.\u00a0 The American taxpayer won\u2019t put up with that.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, are you concerned with what the second whistleblower may reveal about your conversation with Ukraine?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Not at all, because the call was a perfect call.\u00a0 You had stenographers, you had people that took it down exactly.\u00a0 It was a perfect call.\u00a0 It\u2019s just a scam.\u00a0 This is a scam by the Democrats to try and win an election that they\u2019re not going to win in 2020.\nAll you have to do is take a look at the polls, see what happened.\u00a0 One poll had me up 12 points, 16 points, or 17 points.\nWe \u2014 just take a look at what\u2019s going on.\u00a0 The people understand it\u2019s a scam.\u00a0 They\u2019re trying to win an election in 2020 by using impeachment.\u00a0 If you look at that call, it\u2019s a perfect call.\u00a0 It\u2019s congenial.\u00a0 There was no pressure.\u00a0 And what did the head of Ukraine say?\u00a0 What did the head \u2014 did he say there was no pressure?\u00a0 Did his person say \u2014 his top representative, his foreign minister, say there was no pressure whatsoever.\u00a0 There was no pressure put on him.\u00a0 This is a scam.\u00a0 This is one of the greatest scams we \u2014\nLook, we beat you on the \u2014 we won on the Mueller scam.\u00a0 That was a whole big deal.\u00a0 That lasted for two and a half years.\u00a0 We had a few days of peace and then, all of a sudden, they came up with this one.\u00a0 But I guess it\u2019s just part of my life.\u00a0 This is the most ridiculous thing many people have ever seen.\u00a0 All you have to do is read.\u00a0 All you have to do is read what they wrote down, the stenographers.\u00a0 They wrote down an exact call.\nNow, what happened is Schiff, Adam Schiff, went up before Congress, and he read the most horrible speech, attributed the speech to me.\u00a0 These people won\u2019t believe this one.\u00a0 If you went to Annapolis, West Point, or the Air Force Academy, you\u2019re not going to believe this one happened.\u00a0 He went up, and he took a speech, and he made it up.\u00a0 It was horrible.\u00a0 And he said, \u201cThe President of the United States said this on the call.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s a fraud.\u00a0 He real- \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a fraudulent speech.\u00a0 What he did is incredible.\u00a0 And it shouldn\u2019t be allowed.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be allowed.\u00a0 I think a lot of things are happening.\nBy the way, Nancy Pelosi knew it was a fraud, and she didn\u2019t say anything about it.\u00a0 But if you look at the call \u2014 you just take a look at that call \u2014 that call is a very \u2014 a terrific call.\u00a0 It\u2019s congenial, there was no pressure, there was no anything.\u00a0 And you know it, and so do I, and so does everybody else.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why the polls are doing well.\u00a0 That\u2019s why \u2014 I don\u2019t bring up fundraising, but that\u2019s why, I believe, in the history of the Republican Party at this time, they\u2019ve never had anything like the numbers that have been raised.\u00a0 They raised $13 million in many small donations in a 24-hour period.\u00a0 That hasn\u2019t even happened.\nSo, people understand that it\u2019s a fraud.\u00a0 It\u2019s a scam.\u00a0 It\u2019s a witch hunt.\u00a0 And all we do is just keep fighting for the American people, because that\u2019s all I do.\nWe win.\u00a0 Our economy is doing great.\u00a0 Our jobs numbers are the best they\u2019ve ever been.\u00a0 Just about the best they\u2019ve ever been for many groups: African Americans, Asians, Hispanics. They\u2019re the best they\u2019ve ever been in the history of our country.\u00a0 And overall, they\u2019re the best numbers in 51 years.\nSo, we\u2019re doing great things and we\u2019re going to keep going.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nEND\n6:25 P.M.

EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much everybody.\u00a0 I want to start by wishing my very good friend, Prime Minister Abe of Japan, a very happy birthday.\u00a0\u00a0 He\u2019s 39 years old today.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So please extend my wishes to the Prime Minister.\u00a0 He\u2019s a great gentleman and we have had tremendous success.\nAs you know, in addition to what we\u2019re talking about today, they\u2019re building \u2014 Japan \u2014 many car plants in the United States, which they weren\u2019t doing for a long time.\u00a0 And they\u2019re building in Michigan, Ohio, lots of different states.\u00a0 And we just appreciate it very much.\u00a0 Been a tremendous investment.\nBut we\u2019re here to talk about a little bit of a different purchase, and that\u2019s good as far as we\u2019re concerned.\u00a0 And I want to thank you very much.\u00a0 Very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo we\u2019re gathered here today at the White House this afternoon to discuss a very strong and groundbreaking achievement for the United States and Japan: the signing of the new U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement and the U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement.\u00a0 Digital is becoming a very big factor in the world.\nThese two deals represent a tremendous victory for both of our nations.\u00a0 They will create countless jobs, expand investment and commerce, reduce our trade deficit very substantially, promote fairness and reciprocity, and unlock the vast opportunities for growth.\nIn the United States, these deals are a game changer for our farmers and our ranchers \u2014 we love our farmers and we love our ranchers; we\u2019ve been working very hard on this \u2014 providing them with significantly enhanced access to a critical foreign market.\nIn a moment, I\u2019ll be really honoring a lot of the folks in the room that are here with us from farm country, ranch country.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to be witnessing a historic signing by Ambassador Robert Lighthizer and Ambassador from Japan \u2014 a long trip, but you just got here \u2014 Sugiyama of Japan.\u00a0 And we\u2019re grateful to both of you for the outstanding job you\u2019ve done and all of the people that were involved with both of you, your staffs and your representatives.\u00a0 Thank you both very much.\u00a0 Bob, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 It\u2019s a lot of work.\nWe\u2019re also delighted that Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao is here.\u00a0 Where is Elaine?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Where is Elaine?\u00a0 Hi, Elaine.\nSECRETARY CHAO:\u00a0 Sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 She\u2019s busy.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Doing a fantastic job.\u00a0 Thank you \u2014\nSECRETARY CHAO:\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 very much, honey.\nDeputy Secretary of Agriculture Stephen Censky is here.\u00a0 Where is Stephen?\nDEPUTY SECRETARY CENSKY:\u00a0 Right here.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Stephen?\u00a0 Hi, Stephen.\nDEPUTY SECRETARY CENSKY:\u00a0 Good you see you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Great job.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Spoke to Sonny last night.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing well.\nA very great gentleman, a very popular man too, in the world and especially his wonderful state, Steve Daines.\u00a0 Steve, I saw you back there.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Hi, Steve.\u00a0 Hi, Steve.\u00a0 I also should \u2014 I saw your poll numbers.\u00a0 You are strong.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 You\u2019re doing good.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a good decision by the voters, I can tell you.\u00a0 Thanks, Steve.\nRepresentatives Jodey Arrington and Kevin Hern.\u00a0 And thank you, fellas, for being here.\u00a0 As well as, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum.\u00a0 Doug, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\nPARTICIPANT:\u00a0 Over there.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Doug?\u00a0 Where\u2019s Doug?\u00a0 Good, Doug.\u00a0 Good job.\u00a0 Say hello to your wife.\nGOVERNOR BURGUM:\u00a0 I will.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 North Carolina Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest.\u00a0 Hi, Dan.\u00a0 Hi.\u00a0 We just approved that last amount of money for the hurricane.\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR FOREST:\u00a0 Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You know about that, right?\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR FOREST:\u00a0 Yes, Mr. President.\u00a0 Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Iowa Lieutenant Governor Adam Gregg.\u00a0 Adam, great job.\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GREGG:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Great job.\nAnd many other state and local officials.\u00a0 We have some tremendously respected people here \u2014 political people.\nI want to extend a special welcome to all of the leaders here today representing American farmers and ranchers benefitting from this deal \u2014 this is a tremendously important deal and a very big deal \u2014 including those from our beef, pork, poultry, wheat, dairy, and corn associations.\nI would particularly like to recognize Zippy.\u00a0 Zippy Duvall.\u00a0 He\u2019s been with us from the beginning.\u00a0 Zippy?\u00a0 Zippy?\nMR. DUVALL:\u00a0 Hey, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Where\u2019s my Zippy?\u00a0 Hi.\u00a0 Very good.\u00a0 Thank you for being here.\nMR. DUVALL:\u00a0 Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Zippy is always \u2014 he\u2019s always \u2014 he\u2019s always here trying to make good deals for your folks, right?\nMR. DUVALL:\u00a0 Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 He\u2019s the President and CEO of the American Farm Bureau Federation.\u00a0 And we\u2019re doing really well.\u00a0 I \u2014 in fact, we\u2019re doing a deal with \u2014 a big deal with Japan.\u00a0 But, you know, China is big \u2014 buying again.\u00a0 You see that China is buying very big.\nMR. DUVALL:\u00a0 We see that, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 A lot of people don\u2019t like to talk about that, but China is in the market buying very big \u2013agricultural.\nWe\u2019re also joined by several senior leaders from our nation\u2019s top technology companies, including Chris Padilla of IBM.\u00a0 Hi, Chris.\u00a0 How are you?\u00a0 How\u2019s IBM doing?\nMR. PADILLA:\u00a0 Doing very well, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Very good.\u00a0 You have a lot to do with farming, too, I know, right?\nMR. PADILLA:\u00a0 We do.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 With all of those programs that you do.\u00a0 Smart farming.\u00a0 Very smart farming.\nPeggy Johnson of Microsoft.\u00a0 Peggy, thank you very much for being here.\u00a0 Please say hello, too.\nAnd Craig Albright of Business Software Alliance.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Craig.\u00a0 We appreciate it.\nWe do appreciate your support, and it really is now smart farming.\u00a0 In fact, going to MIT doesn\u2019t hurt either, right?\u00a0 When you\u2019re a farmer nowadays.\u00a0 It\u2019s incredible what they do.\nFrom day one, my administration has fought tirelessly to achieve a level playing field for the American worker.\nIn addition to the agreements we\u2019re signing with Japan today, we reached a tremendous agreement with Mexico and Canada to replace NAFTA with the new USMCA.\u00a0 And hopefully that\u2019ll get done in the not-too-distant future.\u00a0 Everybody wants it.\u00a0 Manufacturers want it, farmers want it, even unions want it.\u00a0 People want it.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a great deal for all of the countries, but in particular, it\u2019s a great deal for us and our workers.\nWe\u2019re also completely renegotiating \u2014 and now we\u2019ve completed that and signed it \u2014 the U.S.-Korea Trade Agreement to substantially expanding American auto exports.\u00a0 It\u2019s made a tremendous difference.\u00a0 That was a terrible agreement, and we renegotiated it and it\u2019s now a very good agreement for the United States.\u00a0 It was not a good agreement for the United States at all.\nToday\u2019s signing of the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement and U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement builds on these incredible successes to the benefit of both of our nations.\u00a0 And I have to say that, while we\u2019re here, and because of the fact that we\u2019re talking about agriculture, ethanol, and the farmers of Nebraska and Iowa and all of the different places that wanted it, we\u2019ve come to an agreement.\u00a0 And it\u2019s going to be, I guess, about getting close to 16 billion barrels.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 Something like that.\u00a0 That\u2019s a lot.\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GREGG:\u00a0 Sixteen billion gallons.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s a lot.\u00a0 Say it again.\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GREGG:\u00a0 Sixteen billion gallons.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s a lot.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 That\u2019s a lot of gallons.\u00a0 So I think they \u2014 so they should like me out in Iowa and all of the different places, huh?\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GREGG:\u00a0 Very appreciative of your actions, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I think so.\nAnd also, and very importantly, we\u2019ve taken in tremendous amounts of money in the form of tariffs from China.\u00a0 China has eaten the cost of those tariffs because they\u2019ve devalued their currency and they\u2019ve also pumped a lot of money into their system.\u00a0 Deflation is \u2014 we have no inflation.\u00a0 If anything, it\u2019s going below the number so, therefore, we\u2019re entitled to an interest rate cut.\u00a0 I hope the Fed does that because we\u2019d be like a rocket ship.\u00a0 And we\u2019re already the strongest economy in the world and doing better than just about any economy in the world.\u00a0 And a lot of people are asking us the secret.\u00a0 But we\u2019d like to see an interest rate cut \u2014 a very substantial one.\u00a0 And whatever else they want to do.\u00a0 But we would be a rocket ship.\nAnd if you look at from the time I got elected \u2014 if you go to November 9th, the day after the election \u2014 we\u2019re up close to 60 percent in the market, which is numbers that are pretty much unheard of because it\u2019s a fairly short period of time.\nOur country is doing really well.\u00a0 But we are taking care of our farmers out of the billions and billions of dollars that we\u2019ve gotten.\u00a0 You know about that Zippy, right?\nMR. DUVALL:\u00a0 Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So we\u2019re giving $12 billion from the year before \u2014 $12 billion.\u00a0 And that\u2019s compliments of China.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 And $16 billion this last year.\u00a0 And then we\u2019ll see what happens next year.\u00a0 Maybe by that time it\u2019s straightened out.\u00a0 But the farmers and ranchers were targeted, to put it mildly, by China.\u00a0 And it\u2019s nice that they\u2019re coming back.\nAnd, by the way, China is also coming here on \u2014 their representatives \u2014 they\u2019re coming on Thursday and Friday, Bob, I believe.\u00a0 And so you\u2019ll start some negotiations.\u00a0 And the relationship is very good.\u00a0 As to whether or not we make a deal, I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 But there\u2019s certainly a good possibility.\u00a0 But the relationship is a very good one.\u00a0\u00a0 But we\u2019ve taken in billions of dollars.\nAnd of those many, many more billions, we\u2019re giving $16 billion to our farmers because I asked Sonny Perdue \u2014 I said, \u201cSonny, what was the amount of money that \u2014 last year, that the farmers were hurt?\u201d\u00a0 He said, \u201cLet me get back to you.\u201d\u00a0 He got back to me.\u00a0 The number was $16 billion.\u00a0 I said, \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to take $16 billion out of the tariffs and we\u2019re going to give it to the American farmer.\u201d\u00a0 And I think they appreciated that.\nIt never gets reported by the \u201cfake news,\u201d as I say.\u00a0 But it never gets reported.\u00a0 Never.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know why.\u00a0 They don\u2019t want to do it.\nAnd then, Zippy, as you know, we took $12 billion from the year before.\u00a0 And that also came from large amounts of tariff and \u2014 tariffs.\u00a0 And people were actually saying \u2014 I read a report today, I believe in the Washington Times, where they talked about the tremendous amount of money that has actually come in from tariffs.\u00a0 And it\u2019s been a number that we\u2019ve never even seen before in this country.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a tremendous amount of money coming in.\nAnd some of the Republican senators \u2014 and it\u2019s not a bad idea \u2014 said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we give it?\u201d\u00a0 Because we have a lot of money left over after taking care of our farmers.\u00a0 And what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re bringing it right up to the level that the farmers were targeted by.\u00a0 So, in theory, they should be \u2014 it should be, in its own way, a level playing field.\u00a0 The amazing thing about the farmer \u2014 and I\u2019ve been with so many \u2014 they don\u2019t even want that, right?\nMR. DUVALL:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 They just want a level playing field.\u00a0 They don\u2019t even want $16 billion.\u00a0 I think almost anybody else \u2014 Larry Kudlow \u2014 wants $16 billion.\u00a0 The farmer doesn\u2019t want it.\u00a0 They want a level playing field.\u00a0 They want to play the game the way it should be played.\u00a0 And I think we\u2019re probably pretty close to doing that too.\u00a0 But in the meantime, no other President would get $16 billion and $12 billion for the American farmer or rancher \u2014 that I can tell you.\u00a0 So \u2014\nMR. DUVALL:\u00a0 Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 maybe it was your great work.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 Right?\nMR. DUVALL:\u00a0 Your work, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It was all of us.\u00a0 Everybody standing up here, frankly.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, today Japan has committed to dramatically increase market access to American food and agricultural exports.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very dramatic number.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the larger trade deals ever signed.\u00a0 As a result, 126 million Japanese consumers will have greater access to high-quality American almonds, blueberries, corn, wine, poultry, and egg products, beef, pork, wheat, and so much more.\u00a0 Anything else you folks can think of?\u00a0 Do you want to shout it out?\u00a0 Anything?\u00a0 Steve?\u00a0 Anybody?\u00a0 No?\nSENATOR DAINES:\u00a0 Beef.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Beef.\u00a0 Did I not say that?\nPARTICIPANT:\u00a0 Ethanol.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Ethanol.\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 That\u2019s an interes- \u2014 let me think about that one.\nOnce this agreement enters into force, Japanese tariffs will be completely eliminated, so that Japan will not be charging us, as they have, for many, many years \u2014 and that\u2019s \u2014 we appreciate it \u2014 and substantially reduced over 90 percent of the United States agricultural exports.\u00a0 That\u2019s a big thing because we\u2019re getting charged a lot of tariffs.\u00a0 And it\u2019s okay for us to charge, but we can\u2019t have other countries charge.\nOur farmers, ranchers, and growers will now be able to compete fairly in Japan against major competitors worldwide.\u00a0 In addition to these agricultural agreements, the extraordinary digital agreement that we\u2019re signing \u2014 so, that digital agreement is a very big deal in its own right \u2014 we\u2019re signing today, sets standards on the $40 billion in digital trade between the United States and Japan.\nAnd we just won a big \u2014 talking about digital and talking about the Internet \u2014 but we just won the big case, as you know.\u00a0 And you people would really know, right?\u00a0 But that was a big case that we won on net neutrality.\u00a0 Just won it.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a \u2014 going to receive \u2014 maybe they won\u2019t even appeal it, because it\u2019s a very hard case to appeal, but it was a tremendous victory in terms of speed and in terms of investment on the Internet.\nThis deal is remarkable in that it will ensure that Americans have a level playing field in trading cutting-edge products and services, such as videos, music, e-books, and software.\u00a0 These comprehensive provisions meet the gold standard of digital trade rules that were set in the landmark USMCA.\u00a0 And, again, we hope that\u2019s going to get voted on.\u00a0 We hope that Nancy Pelosi gets it voted on because everyone wants it, and she\u2019ll have to make her own decision.\u00a0 Let her make her own decision.\u00a0 But I can tell you the American public is tired of Do-Nothing.\u00a0 And we are doing a lot, and the Democrats are doing nothing.\nThriving commerce between the United States and Japan is essential to advancing opportunity and prosperity for our people.\u00a0 The United States and Japan are the world\u2019s largest and third-largest economies.\u00a0 Together, our nations comprise nearly one-third of the entire globe\u2019s GDP.\u00a0 Japan is America\u2019s third-largest agricultural export market, and this makes it even bigger.\u00a0 And America is Japan\u2019s foreign investor, and that\u2019s what I was talking about \u2014 all of the plants that are going up all over the country.\nI said to Prime Minister Abe: \u201cPlease, we need auto plants.\u201d\u00a0 And I said that right at the beginning when I first met with him, and immediately liked him a lot.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve really produced.\u00a0 They\u2019re doing a lot of plants, not just auto.\u00a0 Many, many \u2014 many, many plants and factories are being built in the United States by Japan and Japanese companies.\nThese agreements will ensure that our economic partnership flourishes brighter than ever before.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re probably at a stage with Japan where I don\u2019t think our relationship has ever been stronger or better than it is right now.\nIn the months ahead, our teams will continue negotiations on remaining areas of interest to achieve a final and very comprehensive agreement.\u00a0 We\u2019re working on that right now.\u00a0 There\u2019s some big, big things that we\u2019re working on.\nAnd I\u2019d like now to invite Ambassador Robert Lighthizer to provide further details on these historic deals.\u00a0 And I want to thank you very much.\u00a0 I want to thank everybody in the room for being here.\u00a0 And thank you very much to the media for being here too.\u00a0 Thank you.\nPlease, Robert.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much, Mr. President.\u00a0 Thank you for helping us get this agreement across the finish line.\u00a0 But more importantly, thank you for reorienting trade policy in the United States in the direction of America\u2019s workers, farmers, and ranchers.\nFor too long, we had lost our way, quite frankly.\u00a0 And during the last almost three years, you\u2019ve brought us back.\u00a0 And I\u2019m very grateful for that, and I\u2019m grateful to have been a part of it.\nI want to thank, if I can, a few people on my team.\u00a0 We had a huge group involved.\u00a0 Jeff Gerrish and Greg Doud, my \u2014 two of my deputies; Michael Beeman; Sharon Bomer Lauritsen.\u00a0 And then there are lots of other people who gets a lot of credit for doing this.\nLet me just quickly make the point that the President has already made: This is a very big trade deal.\u00a0 This is about 55 billion dollars\u2019 worth of trade.\u00a0 With this, we\u2019ll have more than 95 percent of the GDP that would have been in TPP.\u00a0 So it\u2019s very important for farmers.\u00a0 It\u2019s also important for digital trade.\nJapan is the biggest market for United States in beef, pork, wheat.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a substantial market in a variety of other things, including potatoes, which weren\u2019t mentioned, and a lot of the nuts and other products.\u00a0 It also affects wine and the like.\u00a0 So we see \u2014 we think we\u2019ll have substantial additional sales as a result of this.\nSo, thank you again, Mr. President.\u00a0 It\u2019s a pleasure \u2014 it\u2019s an honor for me to be the person who gets to sign this.\nI would like now to turn it over to \u2014 the podium over to Ambassador Sugiyama, who is not only the Ambassador from Japan to the United States, but also was very active in actually getting this deal across the finish line.\u00a0 So thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR SUGIYAMA:\u00a0 Well, frankly speaking, I must tell you that I feel really daunting, and I feel very much tense.\u00a0 And I couldn\u2019t feel more honored to be here in this signing ceremony place in the White House, Mr. President.\u00a0 In front of this top leadership, no ambassador couldn\u2019t feel as I just told you.\nMr. President, Ambassador Lighthizer, and members of Congress, and members of Cabinet, and governors, distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen: Actually, I couldn\u2019t forget the time when Mr. President and my Prime Minister Abe declared, just about one month and \u2014 one year and one month ago, something in the sideline of UNGA last year, to declare that we should, sooner than later, kick off a bilateral trade agreement.\u00a0 That was 13 months ago or something.\nAnd with some reasons, I think it took (inaudible) something like six months to wrap things up by Mr. President and my Prime Minister in New York on the 25th of last month to declare that, politically, it was all done.\u00a0 It was only remaining, you know, legal (inaudible), technical sort of things.\nAnd then, my people and Bob Lighthizer\u2019s people, and your people and everybody, spent 24 hours, day and night, to finalize everything so that we are able to have, today, for the formal signing ceremony day, to sign up the (inaudible) trade agreement, as well, as Mr. President rightly mentioned, important thing is plus digital trade agreement, as well as other related, attached document (inaudible).\nActually, I had to sign 16 or 18 places prior to this \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 with my very beautiful fountain pen.\u00a0 Actually, Mr. President was kind enough to give me a really, really memorable pen to sign with \u2014 with his really good signatures.\nSo, to me, as Bob Lighthizer was kind enough to mention that, from the stretch I was in, in the (inaudible), and then Bob Lighthizer and my Minister Motegi \u2014 their team and our team seemed to be sometimes very much \u2014 you know, tense discussions, something which is quite not abnormal, because after all, this is a trade deal.\nBut, basically, based upon the fundamental friendship and trust relations between the two leaders, Mr. President and my Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\u00a0 And plus, Ambassador Lighthizer and his opposite number, Minister Motegi, and us.\nSo we have had a really serious and fierce sometimes debates, which is really natural.\u00a0 But really, a (inaudible) was something to go to try to target the same target to gain, for both of us, a beneficial outcome, which is something that I feel very much honored to sign this afternoon.\nSo \u2014 and then, as Mr. President and Lighthizer \u2014 Ambassador Lighthizer mentioned, we have \u2014 well, Mr. President, unfortunately, we are outnumbered by the people you have here \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 because you are here in the States.\u00a0 We are in Washington.\u00a0 But nonetheless, we have three gentlemen from Japan Commerce Association of Washington, D.C.: Tetsuo Iguchi, Toshiba Corporation.\u00a0 Here they are.\u00a0 And then, two Mitsubishi Corporation: Go Eguchi and Akihiko Nakazono.\u00a0 And these are the guys who are kind enough to join us.\nAs I told you, repeatedly, we are unfortunately slightly outnumbered \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 but they are kind enough to come over to see this signing ceremony because of the importance for the Japanese business and Japanese market and all Japan.\nThank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 And thank you everybody.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER:\u00a0 I\u2019m not doing this until you tell me.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Go ahead.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nI do want to pay compliments, though.\u00a0 Look at these five gentlemen right there.\u00a0 Right there.\u00a0 That\u2019s central casting.\u00a0 They are very tough negotiators.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Tough negotiators.\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Congratulations.\n(The agreements are signed.)\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWell, that\u2019s a big one.\u00a0 That\u2019s a very big one.\u00a0 And I\u2019d like to just introduce, if I might, some of the folks here.\u00a0 As you know, Ambassador Gerrish and Doud have been introduced.\u00a0 And great job, fellas.\u00a0 But Bruce Kettler, Director of the Indiana State Department of Agriculture.\u00a0

HERRING:\u00a0 This is wonderful news for our pork producers in this country.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\nMR. HERRING:\u00a0 Japan has been our number one value market for many years.\u00a0 And it\u2019s just great momentum.\u00a0 It creates tremendous opportunity in rural America.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And China is a big buyer right now, right?\nMR. HERRING:\u00a0 Pork is starting to move to China.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yep. \u00a0I know.\u00a0 China \u2014 they\u2019re going to be a very big buyer.\u00a0 It\u2019s already happened.\nKody Carson \u2014 thank you very much.\nMR.

WACKER:\u00a0 Thank you so very much.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Fantastic job you\u2019ve all done.\u00a0 And again, my friend.\nSENATOR DAINES:\u00a0 Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Great job, Steve.\nOkay, so we\u2019ve had a tremendous success.\u00a0 Likewise, we\u2019re having a lot of successes.\u00a0 We have tremendous success at the border.\nI want to thank Mexico for what they\u2019ve been doing.\u00a0 You look at the numbers; they\u2019re tumbling down.\u00a0 This is one on catch and release.\u00a0 Look at that.\u00a0 See that, fellas?\u00a0 Catch and \u2014 would you say that\u2019s pretty good?\u00a0 I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty good.\u00a0 I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty amazing, Steve, even for your \u2014 from your standpoint, Steve, fellas.\u00a0 That\u2019s some number, huh?\u00a0 Getting down to almost zero.\u00a0 Look.\nSo it was not doing so good for a long time.\u00a0 Catch and release.\u00a0 We had no help from the Do-Nothing Democrats, so we did it with Mexico.\u00a0 We did it with Guatemala.\u00a0 We did it with \u2014 I mean, we did it with some countries that really stopped \u2014 El Salvador; Honduras; and others \u2014 other countries \u2014 countries that are signing safe third agreements, which nobody thought would be even possible.\u00a0 And the border is really doing well.\nAnd again, Mexico, today has 27,000 soldiers.\u00a0 Twenty-seven thousand.\u00a0 I want to thank the President of Mexico, because he\u2019s been great.\nBut the border is really looking good.\u00a0 The wall is moving rapidly.\u00a0 Large sections are being built every day.\u00a0 More contracts are being given out.\u00a0 We\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re doing it in about 17 different sections, because it\u2019s over 450 miles long \u2013the area we have to close up.\u00a0 And it could even hit 500 at some point.\u00a0 And we expect to have anywhere between 4- and 500 built, hopefully by the end of next year.\u00a0 It\u2019s going up very rapidly.\nIt\u2019s a very \u2014 it\u2019s a very powerful wall.\u00a0 It\u2019s got everything you can have.\u00a0 It was \u2014 and the Border Patrol just left, actually.\u00a0 We were going over some of the numbers.\u00a0 And we gave them every single element of the wall that they wanted.\nWe had mountain climbers come in to climb \u2014 do you believe this?\u00a0 We had different samples put up and we had mountain climbers, literally, come in.\u00a0 \u201cWhich is the hardest one to climb?\u201d\u00a0 The panel \u2014 the steel panel on top makes it very difficult.\u00a0 It\u2019s called an anti-climb panel.\u00a0 I never thought I would be doing this for a living: anti- \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 we built an anti-climb panel.\u00a0 Without the panel, they get across it easy.\u00a0 With the panel, it\u2019s not so \u2014 it\u2019s not easy.\u00a0 So, anti-climb panel at the top.\nAnd the border is coming along well.\u00a0 The economy is doing great.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing \u2014 as I said before, we\u2019re the hottest economy in the world.\u00a0 We\u2019re the largest economy in the world.\u00a0 We\u2019re up $15 trillion, at least, since the election.\u00a0 Fifteen trillion.\nAnd China is down, probably, 22 or 24 trillion.\u00a0 So I think China might have caught us if my opponent had gotten in.\u00a0 By now, they would have caught us.\u00a0 And now it\u2019s going to be a long time before they catch us, if they ever catch us.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think anybody is going to catch us.\u00a0 If we\u2019re smart, nobody will catch us.\nSo with that being said, if you have any questions on the trade deal, please.\u00a0 Anything on the trade deal, specifically?\u00a0 Yeah, please.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you have any predictions about China?\u00a0 Do you expect a whole new offer or any optimism?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, they want to make a deal.\u00a0 They\u2019re down three and a half million jobs since we started doing what we do.\u00a0 And their supply chain is really cracked and broken.\u00a0 And they want to make a deal.\nNow, they\u2019re coming to see us on Thursday and Friday.\u00a0 We think there is a chance that we could do something very substantial.\u00a0 Bob, I think you think that.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see what happens.\u00a0 But, in the meantime, we\u2019re taking in billions and billions of dollars of tariffs every month and we\u2019ve never had this.\u00a0 We never took in 10 cents from China and we\u2019re taking in billions of dollars and tens of billions a year.\nAnd on October 15th, as you know, it goes up from \u2014 up to 35 \u2014 I guess, it goes to 35.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to \u2014 it\u2019s going to raise fairly substantially.\u00a0 We could always do it a lot more, but we\u2019ve decided not to.\nSo that\u2019s the story.\u00a0 And I think that they will \u2014 they\u2019re coming to make a deal.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see whether or not a deal can be made, but it\u2019s got to be a fair deal.\nLook, we\u2019ve lost $500 billion a year for many, many years on average.\u00a0 If you include intellectual property theft and all of the other things that took place, it\u2019s incredible that past administrations could have allowed it to happen.\u00a0 We\u2019re talking about $500 billion \u2014 not million; that\u2019s a lot, too \u2014 $500 billion a year, for many years, taken out of our country.\nWe rebuilt China.\u00a0 They did a great job and I don\u2019t blame them.\u00a0 I told President Xi, \u201cI don\u2019t blame you one bit.\u201d\u00a0 I blame the people that ran this country to allow that to happen.\u00a0 And they understand that.\u00a0 But we don\u2019t let that happen anymore.\nSo, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have a very important meeting.\u00a0 And they have their top people coming in.\u00a0 And I have my top people doing the job.\u00a0 And if I don\u2019t think they\u2019re doing a good job, I\u2019ll fire them and I\u2019ll go over and take their place.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Okay?\nYeah, please.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On Hong Kong, sir, are the Hong Kong protests linked, in your view, to the China trade negotiations in any way?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019d like to see a very humane solution to that.\u00a0 I hope that\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0 And, you know, Hong Kong is very important as a world hub \u2014 not just for China, but for the world.\u00a0 And you have great people over there.\nI see they\u2019re flying the American flags.\u00a0 They even have signs: \u201cMake China Great Again.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cMake Hong Kong Great Again.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nAnd I\u2019m saying, \u201cGet those signs.\u201d\u00a0 But they have, you know, tremendous signage and tremendous \u2014 they have a tremendous spirit for our country.\u00a0 They have a lot of American flags, a lot of Trump signs.\nI\u2019d just like to see a humane deal be worked out.\u00a0 And I think President Xi has the ability to do it.\nI sort of said that I think if he met \u2014 he\u2019s a very convincing man, and I think if he met with some of the leaders \u2014 that could be one problem, you don\u2019t seem to have a specific leader of the group.\u00a0 But I really think they can do something.\u00a0 We just want to see a humane solution.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did you tell Xi Jinping in any way that you would be quiet about Hong Kong protests during the course of these negotiations?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I didn\u2019t.\u00a0 But I do say that we are negotiating.\u00a0 If anything happened bad, I think that would be a very bad for the negotiation.\u00a0 I think, politically, it would be very tough maybe for us, and maybe for some others, and maybe for him.\nBut, no, I think that they have to do that in a peaceful manner.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2014 now, I will say, the first time I saw it, if you look \u2014 a number of months ago, I saw 2 million people.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u00a0 We talk about crowd size.\u00a0 That was serious crowd size, right?\u00a0\u00a0 The crowd size is much smaller now, so maybe that\u2019s saying something.\u00a0 But hopefully they can work out something that\u2019s amicable.\nYes, sir.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, would you accept a partial trade deal with China?\u00a0 There has been some talk today about whether or not it could be headed in that direction.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, it\u2019s a very good question.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s not what we prefer at all.\u00a0 They are starting to buy a lot of our agricultural products.\u00a0 You see that.\u00a0 They\u2019re coming in very strong on pork, also \u2014 very, very strong \u2014 and in particular.\u00a0 But on other products, that \u2014 so, I don\u2019t know if you call that a \u201cpartial.\u201d\u00a0 We don\u2019t have an agreement.\nMy inclination is to get a big deal.\u00a0 We\u2019ve come this far.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing well.\u00a0 Again, the fact that they\u2019ve done what they\u2019ve done with their currency \u2014 the devaluation \u2014 it really has not increased prices.\u00a0 And now we\u2019re talking China.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t mean that in all cases that happens; other countries prices increase, but in the case of China that hasn\u2019t happened.\u00a0 And they put a lot of money into their goods.\u00a0 They want to keep their people working.\u00a0 I understand that very well.\nBut I think that we\u2019ll just have to see what happens.\u00a0 I would much prefer a big deal.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re shooting for.\u00a0 Can something happen?\u00a0 I guess, maybe.\u00a0 Who knows?\u00a0 But I think it\u2019s probably unlikely.\u00a0 Okay?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, on Syria \u2014 on withdrawing forces in Syria \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 why are you siding with an authoritarian leader and not our Kurdish allies?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I\u2019m not siding with anybody.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been in Syria for many years.\u00a0 You know, Syria was supposed to be a short-term hit \u2014 just a very short-term hit.\u00a0 And we were supposed to be in and out.\u00a0 That was many, many years ago.\u00a0 And we only have 50 people in that area.\u00a0 That\u2019s a small sector.\nAnd I don\u2019t want those 50 people hurt or killed or anything.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want anything bad to happen to our people.\u00a0 And I told that to President Erdo\u011fan.\u00a0 I said, \u201cDon\u2019t hurt any of our \u2014 any of our people get hurt, big trouble.\u201d\nNow, a couple of things: I think there\u2019s a lot of pressure on Turkey.\u00a0 They have been fighting with the PKK for many years.\u00a0 They\u2019re natural enemies.\u00a0 If you read today, a couple of reports saying that when President Obama started this whole thing \u2014 as you know, it was started by President Obama \u2014 he created a natural war with Turkey and their long-time enemy, PKK.\u00a0 And they\u2019re still there.\u00a0 And they\u2019re still hating each other beyond anybody\u2019s belief.\nBut I have told Turkey that if they do anything outside of what we would think is humane \u2014 to use the word a second time; we talk about Hong Kong, we talk about this \u2014 they could suffer the wrath of an extremely decimated economy.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve done it once.\u00a0 I did it with Pastor Brunson.\u00a0 You remember the Pastor Brunson?\u00a0 And they wouldn\u2019t give Pastor Brunson back, and they ended up giving Pastor Brunson back pretty quickly.\u00a0 Their currency fell at record levels and lots of other things happened.\u00a0 And it was good.\u00a0 I have a very good relationship with President Erdo\u011fan.\u00a0 I want to see it happen.\nI will tell you this though: We defeated ISIS.\u00a0 And when I wanted to \u2014 when we were at 96 and 95 and 97 percent, I sort of said, \u201cLet the other countries in the area finish it off.\u201d\u00a0 And I was met with a lot of anger from some people in our country.\u00a0 I said, \u201cAll right.\u00a0 I\u2019ll finish it off.\u201d\u00a0 And I got together with our generals.\u00a0 I flew to Iraq.\u00a0 I got together.\u00a0 And we did it very quickly.\u00a0 Far quicker than any general from here told us we could do it.\u00a0 We have some great people over there.\u00a0 They did it quickly.\nAnd I said to the European countries, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to take your ISIS\u2026\u201d\u00a0 You know we have 60,000, maybe even 70,000 people \u2014 that includes families, that includes wives of fighters that were killed.\u00a0 We have many fighters that were killed in the battles.\u00a0 And we took it. Over 100 percent of the caliphate, I took over quickly.\u00a0 Nobody else was \u2014 it was a mess when I came to office.\u00a0 And I think most of you would agree to that.\u00a0 It was a real mess.\nI took it over.\u00a0 But then I said, \u201cWhat are we going to do with these 60- to 70,000 people that are being held and being guarded and we can\u2019t release them?\u201d\u00a0 And many fighters also.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cI want them to go back to Germany, to France, to different European countries from where they came.\u201d\u00a0 And I said to the European countries \u2014 I said to all of them, \u201cTake the people back.\u201d\u00a0 And they said, \u201cNo, no, no.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want to do it.\u00a0 We don\u2019t them back.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cWell, they came from Germany or they came from France.\u00a0 Take them back.\u201d\nAnd they\u2019re so used to the United States being a sucker, being a fool \u2014 we\u2019re talking about billions and billions of dollars.\u00a0 You\u2019re talking about life.\u00a0 You\u2019re talking about so many things, so many elements \u2014 and elements of complexity.\u00a0 Because they\u2019re going to walk back into Germany.\u00a0 They\u2019re going to go back into these countries from where they came.\nSo I said, \u201cTake them back.\u201d\u00a0 And they said, \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0 And then I said again, \u201cI\u2019m going to give you another 30 days.\u00a0 Take them back.\u201d\u00a0 And they kept saying, \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0 Maybe they won\u2019t be saying \u201cno\u201d now.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\nSo I told President Erdo\u011fan, \u201cYou got to \u2014 it\u2019s going to be your responsibility.\u201d\u00a0 Now, really, who\u2019s responsible \u2014 it\u2019s really Russia, it\u2019s Turkey, it\u2019s Iran, it\u2019s Iraq, and it\u2019s Syria, and anybody else in the neighborhood.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 We call it the \u201cneighborhood.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s not a friendly neighborhood.\u00a0 But these countries should do it.\nNow, ISIS is the sworn enemy of all of these countries.\u00a0 Many of them they hate far more than they hate us, and those countries hate them at the same level as we do.\u00a0 They\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re terrible, terrible, savage killers.\u00a0 I said, \u201cTake them back.\u201d\nBut these countries are rich, in most cases.\u00a0 They\u2019re powerful.\u00a0 They\u2019ve got armies.\u00a0 They can do the work.\u00a0 But we\u2019re not bringing 50-, 60-, 70-, or even 10,000 people to Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.\u00a0 We\u2019re not going to paying them for the next 50 years, or paying to take care of them for the next 50 years.\u00a0 So we told Europe \u2014 we did a great service to the world.\u00a0 And we did a great service to Europe in particular, where so many of these fighters came from.\nWe said, \u201cTake them back.\u201d\u00a0 And, you know, unfortunately, like NATO, they take advantage.\u00a0 NATO, as you know, I got the Secretary General Stolheim [Stoltenberg] said \u2014 and, I think, very loudly \u2014 the Secretary General of NATO, said that because of what I did, they have paid over $100 billion more money toward NATO defense.\u00a0 But that\u2019s still not enough, okay?\u00a0 It\u2019s still not enough.\u00a0 Not fair.\u00a0 Because United States pays far too much, relative.\u00a0 And obviously, NATO affects them more.\nBut, like NATO, like trade with the European Union, which is a very tough group to trade with \u2014 very, very tough group.\u00a0 Almost as tough as Japan \u2014 not quite.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But they are a very tough group to trade with.\u00a0 They take advantage.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cLook, you take them back.\u00a0 We\u2019re not \u2014 we\u2019re not going to do this.\u00a0 We\u2019re not going to put in Guantanamo Bay and put them all over our prisons.\u201d\nSo, right now, we\u2019re at a position where, if Turkey does anything out of what they should be doing, we will hit them so hard on the economy.\u00a0 But when you talk about soldiers \u2014 we only had 50 soldiers in the area.\u00a0 I think the area was \u2014 it\u2019s a very small area and \u2014 very small area.\u00a0 But we only had 50 soldiers there.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want them to be in a bad or compromising position.\nAnd I will tell you this: Everybody respects our country again.\u00a0 If we want to go in, if we have to go back for any reason \u2014 because bad things happen.\u00a0 But we\u2019re 7,000 miles away.\u00a0 These ISIS people \u2014 whatever you want to call them \u2014 these people are right there.\u00a0 They\u2019re right there.\u00a0 They\u2019re touching many of these countries that I just named.\u00a0 Iran, as an example, hates ISIS.\u00a0 And ISIS hates Iran.\u00a0 Iraq, you know all about that.\u00a0 Turkey, Syria \u2014 let them take care of it.\u00a0 Let them take care of it.\nWe want to bring our troops back home.\u00a0 It\u2019s been many, many years.\u00a0 It\u2019s been decades, in many cases.\u00a0 We want to bring our troops back home.\u00a0 And I got elected on that.\u00a0 If you go back and look at our speeches, I would say, \u201cWe want to bring our troops back home from these endless wars.\u201d\nAnd we\u2019re like a police force over there.\u00a0 We\u2019re policing.\u00a0 We\u2019re not fighting; we\u2019re policing.\u00a0 We\u2019re not a police force.\u00a0 We\u2019re the greatest military force ever assembled because of what I\u2019ve done over the last three years with $2.5 trillion, Mr. Ambassador, we\u2019ve spent on our military \u2014 $2.5 trillion.\nBut we\u2019re not going to be there longer.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to be watching Turkey and we hope that them and all of the other countries \u2014 or some of the other countries, including the European Union \u2014 goes in and does whatever they\u2019re supposed to do with these captured ISIS fighters and families.\u00a0 Okay?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, a number of Republicans, including \u2014 including Nikki Haley and Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell were very critical of this decision today.\u00a0 Mitch McConnell put out a statement saying, wish you would recon- \u2014 exercise leadership and reconsider, and suggested not doing so would be reminiscent of what the Obama administration would do.\u00a0 Would you respond to that, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And also, did you \u2013\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Sure.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did you consult with the Joint Chiefs of Staff when you made this decision?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 I consulted with everybody.\u00a0 I always consult with everybody.\u00a0 If you remember, about eight months ago, I talked about doing this.\u00a0 And we kept 2,000 people there, and then slowly brought them out.\u00a0 But once we captured ISIS, I didn\u2019t see \u2014 I don\u2019t want to stay there for the next 40 years.\u00a0 It\u2019s not going to do anything.\u00a0 The end game is going to be the same.\nI have great respect for all of the people that you named.\u00a0 And they have their opinion, and a lot of people do.\u00a0 And I could also name many more than you just named of people that totally are supportive.\u00a0 You see the names coming out; people are extremely thrilled because they say it\u2019s time to bring our people back home.\u00a0 We\u2019re not a police force.\u00a0 They\u2019re policing the area.\u00a0 We\u2019re not a police force.\nThe UK was very thrilled at this decision.\u00a0 As you know, they\u2019re over there \u2014 they have soldiers over there also.\u00a0 And others.\u00a0 But many people agree with it very strongly.\u00a0 And I understand both sides of it.\u00a0 I fully understand both sides of it.\u00a0 But I campaigned on the fact that I was going to bring our \u2014 our soldiers home, and bring them home as rapidly as possible.\nI, we, all together, you \u2014 we defeated and took over 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate.\u00a0 Everybody said that was going to be an impossible thing to do.\u00a0 I did it, and I did it quickly because we have a great military now.\nWhen I took over our military, we didn\u2019t have ammunition.\u00a0 I was told by a top general \u2014 maybe the top of them all \u2014 \u201cSir, I\u2019m sorry.\u00a0 Sir, we don\u2019t have ammunition.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cI\u2019ll never let another President have that happen to him or her.\u201d\u00a0 We didn\u2019t have ammunition.\nNow, we\u2019ve captured ISIS.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done what we\u2019ve done.\u00a0 We had 50 soldiers in the area you\u2019re talking about.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cWe want to bring our soldiers back home.\u00a0 It\u2019s been a long time.\u201d\nAgain, we were supposed to be in there for a \u2014 just a tiny spot.\u00a0 Like, a 30- to 90-day period.\u00a0 That was many years ago.\u00a0 It\u2019s time.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, the Kurds themselves have lost thousands of fighters in battling ISIS.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s true.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve lost a lot of fighters, too.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can you guarantee their safety?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re going to try.\u00a0 If you look at some of the Kurds, as you know, that was \u2014 that\u2019s a natural enemy of \u2014 of Turkey.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2014 you know, specifically, as I said.\u00a0 I mean, they have natural enemies.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been fighting each other for \u2014 somebody said, today \u2014 hundreds of years.\u00a0 I mean, one historian said they\u2019ve been fighting for hundreds of years.\nWe interject ourself into wars, and we interject ourselves into tribal wars and revolutions and all of these things that are very \u2014 they\u2019re not the kind of thing that you settle the way we\u2019d like to see it settled.\u00a0 It just doesn\u2019t \u2014 it just doesn\u2019t work that way.\u00a0 But hopefully, that\u2019ll all be very strong and strongly done.\nWe\u2019re spending tremendous amounts of money.\u00a0 I can tell you, the two countries that are most disappointed that we\u2019re leaving are China and Russia because they love that we\u2019re bogged down and just watching and spending tremendous amounts of money instead of continuing to build our forces.\nWe have tremendous new weapons under development now.\u00a0 We have weapons that nobody can even believe.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be making some stops over the next four or five weeks.\u00a0 Some we show, some we don\u2019t show.\nBut we\u2019ve rebuilt our nuclear.\u00a0 We\u2019ve renovated and rebuilt nuclear.\u00a0 We\u2019re building submarines the likes of which has \u2014 they\u2019ve never been even thought of before, the genius of them.\u00a0 Hopefully and hope to God we never have to use them.\nBut we are doing what we have to do.\u00a0 But we\u2019ve been there for many years.\u00a0 Long \u2014 many, many, many years beyond what we were supposed to be \u2014 not fighting, just there.\u00a0 Just there.\u00a0 And it\u2019s time to come back home.\nBut I can understand the other side of it.\u00a0 But if you go by the other side, that means we should never, ever come home.\u00a0 We should never, ever come home.\nAnd, you know, I have to sign letters often to parents of young soldiers that were killed.\u00a0 And it\u2019s the hardest thing I have to do in this job.\u00a0 I hate it.\u00a0 I hate it.\u00a0 Afghanistan.\u00a0 I signed one the other day \u2014 Iraq, Syria.\u00a0 They get blown up by mines.\u00a0 They get taken out by a sniper.\u00a0 And I have to write letters to people.\u00a0 And we make each letter different.\u00a0 Each person is different.\u00a0 And we make them personal.\u00a0 But no matter what you do, it\u2019s devastating.\u00a0 The parents will never be the same.\u00a0 The families will never be the same.\u00a0 People are killed.\u00a0 Many people are still being killed.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to go on that way for perhaps a long time.\nAnd we\u2019re willing to do what we have to do, but there has to be an end game.\u00a0 And if you stay, it\u2019s going to be the same thing.\u00a0 Eventually, you\u2019re going to have to leave.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be the same thing.\nSo, I think what we\u2019re doing is the right thing. \u00a0A lot of people agree with me.\u00a0 A lot of people agree with me.\u00a0 And again, you go back and see my speeches, a big part of my speech and always \u2014 when I won what some people consider to be a surprise election \u2014 now I just see a poll that just came out where I\u2019m up massively with independent voters.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s this or because of the hoax, you know, that\u2019s going on with Nancy Pelosi and her \u2014 her friend, Adam Schiff.\u00a0 He\u2019s another beauty.\u00a0 He got caught lying all over the place.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0 He\u2019s a mess.\u00a0 Right now, he\u2019s a mess.\u00a0 And everybody knows it.\u00a0 Just all you have to do is a little good reporting, you\u2019ll see he\u2019s a total mess because he got caught.\nBut, you know, we have to do the right thing for our country, whether it \u2014 whatever it may be.\u00a0 And I just think that\u2019s the right thing.\u00a0 I respect both opinions.\u00a0 The problem with the other opinion is:\u00a0 When do we leave?\u00a0 When do we leave?\u00a0 We\u2019re going to stay there forever?\nYeah, Jeff.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, the White House Counsel\u2019s Office is preparing a letter to \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Yeah.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 to Speaker Pelosi about the impeachment inquiry.\u00a0 What do you hope to achieve with that letter?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0\u00a0 Well, first of all, the impeachment inquiry is a scam.\u00a0 The conversation that I had with the Ukrainian President Zelensky was a very good conv- \u2014 it was a very cordial, very good conversation.\u00a0 The mistake they made \u2014 the opponents, the opposition, the Democrats, the radical Left, deep state, whatever you want to call them \u2014 they came out with a whistleblower report before they saw the conversation.\nHad they waited one day, Nancy Pelosi wouldn\u2019t have made a fool out of herself, and she would have been able to say what I said.\u00a0 Because when she saw it, she said, \u201cThis is not what the whistleblower said.\u201d\u00a0 I had a very, very congenial, nice conversation with a man that I like.\u00a0 And he ran on corruption.\u00a0 Because, as you know, Ukraine is known as a very corrupt country \u2014 one of the most in the world, shockingly, because I know Ukrainian people.\u00a0 It\u2019s surprising to me.\u00a0 But it\u2019s known as one of the most corrupt countries.\nAnd under the past leadership, it was having a lot of difficulty.\u00a0 This gentleman \u2014 the current President, the new President \u2014 ran on the basis of anti-corruption, as you know.\u00a0 I think it was his single-biggest thing.\u00a0 And we had a great conversation, but it wasn\u2019t reported that way.\u00a0 The only reason I would have released a letter \u2014 because I think it\u2019s terrible to have to release a letter that you have with the leader of a country.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s a terrible precedent.\nBut the whistleblower report or whatever the news was, was so off.\u00a0 It was so horrible.\u00a0 I said, \u201cI never said that.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cLet me see it.\u201d\u00a0 We have a stenographer report.\u00a0 We have a very, very word-for-word report of what I said; I released it.\u00a0 And almost everybody that read it said it\u2019s either perfect or really very good.\u00a0 But it\u2019s a very normal, nice conversation.\nAnd when you see that the President of Ukraine, President Zelensky, said, \u201cThere was no pressure put on me whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0 His spokesman came out two days ago \u2014 said there was absolutely no pressure put on the President.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t tell him to say that.\u00a0 There was no pressure put on him.\u00a0 All you have to do is read the report.\nThe problem is, I released it a day after they had already made their big statements.\u00a0 And again, it\u2019s a big scam.\u00a0 And I think Adam Schiff should be investigated for what he did.\u00a0 He took to the great Chamber \u2014 Congress \u2014 and he made a speech.\u00a0 And his speech was a fraud.\u00a0 Everything he said was a fraud.\u00a0 He went out as though I wrote it.\u00a0 He defrauded the American people.\u00a0 He defrauded Congress.\u00a0 He defrauded himself and his family.\u00a0 He made a speech as \u2014 it was a horrible speech.\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhat is this go- \u2014 what\u2019s going on here?\u201d\u00a0 I think he\u2019s having some kind of a breakdown.\u00a0 Because he got up and made a speech that bore no relationship to what the conversation was.\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you, a lot of people heard that speech and a lot of people thought that\u2019s what I said because they heard his speech.\u00a0 Because they\u2019re not going to read a three- or four-page conversation.\u00a0 They don\u2019t have access to it.\u00a0 But I thought it was one of the \u2014 I thought it was a terrible thing, where he\u2019s going up speaking as the President of the United States, saying things that I never said.\u00a0 And the meaning was horrible.\u00a0 And the whole thought was horrible.\nAnd then, the whistleblower, he did \u2014 through his committee, through himself \u2014 he met with a whistleblower.\u00a0 They never said that.\u00a0 They never talked about it.\nAnd Nancy Pelosi knew all of this stuff.\u00a0 I mean, she\u2019s as guilty as he is because she knew all of that.\u00a0 She knew everything about it.\u00a0 And she didn\u2019t do anything about it.\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you what: They should really be looked at very strongly because what they did is unthinkable.\u00a0 What they did to this country is unthinkable.\u00a0 And it\u2019s lucky that I\u2019m the President, because I guess \u2014 I don\u2019t know why \u2014 a lot of people said very few people could handle it.\u00a0 I sort of thrive on it.\u00a0 You know why?\u00a0 Because \u2014 because it\u2019s so important that we get to the bottom.\nWe went through the whole Mueller scam \u2014 two and a half years.\u00a0 We went through that.\u00a0 And I had three, four days where it was, like, over.\u00a0 And then I\u2019m walking into the United Nations, and they released it as I\u2019m walking in, Mr. Ambassador.\u00a0 I\u2019m walking in.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to meet with \u2014 I won\u2019t name, but one of the top leaders of the world.\u00a0 And I see up on the screen and people start screening about this scam called \u201cimpeachment.\u201d\nYou can\u2019t impeach a President for doing a great job.\u00a0 You can\u2019t impeach a President for having the lowest and best unemployment numbers that we\u2019ve had in 51 years.\u00a0 You can\u2019t impeach a President for tax cuts and regulation cuts and creating \u2014 and even the Ambassador would say \u2014 the strongest economy in the world.\u00a0 We have the strongest economy in the world.\nThis is a scam.\u00a0 And the people are wise to it.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why my polls went up, I think they said, 17 points in the last two or three days.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never had that one.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never had that one.\nSo, I think it\u2019s very sad for our country.\u00a0 I think it makes it harder to do my job.\u00a0 But I do my job, and I do it better than anybody has done it for the first two and half years, based on results.\u00a0 I mean, you look at not only the unemployment numbers \u2014 look at the employment numbers, Jeff.\u00a0 We have \u2014 we\u2019re up to almost 160 million people are working.\nAnd now, today, we\u2019ve signed the deal with Japan, which is such an honor.\u00a0 And you have a great country \u2014 a great, great country.\u00a0 And to have you partake in our agricultural product and digital is a real honor for me.\nSo thank you very much for coming all this distance and \u2014 to be here.\u00a0 And I look forward to seeing you for many years to come.\u00a0 Please, again, wish Prime Minister Abe a happy birthday.\u00a0 He\u2019s a very special man.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEND\n4:54 P.M.

(Applause.)\u00a0\u00a0 And I want to \u2014 I want to thank my friend, Secretary Sonny Perdue.\u00a0 He was a governor who transformed the state of Georgia.\u00a0 And I got to tell you, other than my friend who I work with every single day, there is no greater champion for agriculture in America than the 31st Secretary of Agriculture for the United States of America.\u00a0 Join me in thanking Secretary Sonny Perdue.\u00a0 He is an incredible champion.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Stand up, Sonny.\u00a0 Take a bow.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTo Mr. Secretary, to your governor, to the members of Congress, to distinguished guests, but most of all, it\u2019s a joy to be here at Tyson with Noel White and the men and women of this great company \u2014 a legendary American company that sets the pace, that packages the food that feeds America and feeds the world.\u00a0 Congratulations, Tyson.\u00a0 Give yourselves a big round of applause.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 It\u2019s true.\nIt really is great to be back in the Volunteer State.\u00a0 And it\u2019s also a special honor and a joy for me to be here with an American that I\u2019ve really come to admire \u2014 him and his family \u2014 as someone who built a successful career in business, who\u2019s a man of integrity, who came to be known for his values and his vision.\u00a0 He\u2019s a lifelong Tennessean.\u00a0 But he stepped forward not long ago to help lead this state as your governor, and he\u2019s already making an incredible difference in the lives of people across Tennessee.\u00a0 Would you join me in thanking Governor Bill Lee for doing a great job for the people of Tennessee?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 This state and this country are proud, Bill.\nAnd thank you all for that.\u00a0 It really is great to be here with so many friends.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to mention a few more of them along the way.\u00a0 But before we get started, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine.\u00a0 I was talking to him on Air Force Two, right when we were coming in for a landing.\u00a0 He\u2019s a man who loves the state of Tennessee and has been fighting to keep all the promises that he made to the people of Tennessee in 2016.\u00a0 I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd thank you all.\u00a0 Thanks for the wonderful, warm welcome.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2014 it really is great to be here.\u00a0 Great to be here with so many with great Americans, and standing and having a chance to walk through a great American company.\nIt\u2019s amazing to think, now going on almost 100 years, Tyson Foods has been an inspiring story of the American Dream.\u00a0 It\u2019s remarkable to reflect on the fact this company, I\u2019m told, started with one man from a small town in the depths of the Great Depression.\u00a0 He moved his family to Arkansas in a beat-up old truck with only a nickel in his pocket and half a load of hay.\u00a0 That\u2019s impressive.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut John Tyson started hauling live chickens to cities like Kansas City, St. Louis, and Chicago.\u00a0 And in a few years, he opened his own chicken hatchery and feed business, and the rest is history.\nNow, a little more than 90 years later, one out of every five pounds of chicken, beef, and pork sold in America is produced by Tyson.\u00a0 That is a story of the American Dream.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Wow.\nAnd as Noel and I were talking \u2014 because of the extraordinary success of this great company, Tyson supports more than 10,000 farmers and has created more than 100,000 American jobs.\nAnd, of course, Tyson exports its \u2014 all of its goods around the world, feeding the world as well.\u00a0 And I was pleased to hear today that Tyson is growing.\u00a0 In fact, as we speak, Tyson is building another poultry facility in Western Tennessee that, I\u2019m told, is going to support 70 farmers and create another 1,500 jobs right here in the Volunteer State.\u00a0 Thank you, Noel.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Governor Lee is smiling about that news.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut I\u2019m here today because we\u2019ve got work to do, men and women.\u00a0 I\u2019m here today on the President\u2019s behalf because we\u2019ve got an incredible opportunity in front of us.\u00a0 As I stand before you, we have before the Congress of the United States what, once it is approved, will be the largest trade deal in American history.\u00a0 So I came to Tennessee today to say it\u2019s time for Congress to pass the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and pass it this year.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo we\u2019re going to talk about trade today, which Tyson knows just a little bit about \u2014 exporting, as it does, literally all over the world, supporting jobs across Tennessee and across America.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to talk about a great opportunity for Tennessee workers and Tennessee businesses.\u00a0 But before that, let me reflect on the progress we\u2019ve made because of the confidence the people of Tennessee placed in this President and our administration back in 2016.\nYou know, when I think of the last two and a half years, there\u2019s only one way I can describe it.\u00a0 It\u2019s been two and a half years of action.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Two and a half years of results.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s been two and a half years of promises made and promises kept.\u00a0 But we\u2019re just getting started, Tennessee!\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI mean, when you think of what this President has accomplished with our strong allies in Congress, it\u2019s truly remarkable.\u00a0 At a time when too many in Congress have spent the last two and a half years on endless investigations, trying to overturn the will of the American people in the last election, I know the American people are encouraged to see that this President, this Vice President, and this administration will never stop fighting for the policies that Tennessee said yes to in 2016.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 A strong national defense, secure borders, our God-given liberties, and jobs, jobs, jobs.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting for.\nBut I\u2019m here to say that Tennessee and America are now looking to this Democrat majority in the Congress to do their job \u2014 to do a job for the American people.\u00a0 It\u2019s time for Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress to set politics aside and pass the USMCA.\u00a0 It\u2019s a win for Tennessee and a win for America.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYou know, I really believe the American people don\u2019t want more partisanship; we want more jobs.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want more resistance; we want more results, more trade and more exports.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what will come when we approve the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\nAnd when we pass the USMCA, I\u2019m proud to report that we\u2019re going to be building on an incredible amount of progress that the American people have accomplished over the last two and a half years.\nIt\u2019s amazing to think, after eight years of the weakest post-recession economy since the Great Depression, the American economy is booming.\u00a0 The American economy has come roaring back because President Donald Trump has kept the promises he made to Tennessee to revive this economy.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThink about it.\u00a0 I mean, the President said we could revive the economy if we simply put commonsense, free-market principles into practice; if we said \u201cyes\u201d again to the timeless American principles and practices that have always revived our free enterprise system.\nRight after we were elected, we went right to work.\u00a0 We cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms.\u00a0 This President has actually signed more bills, rolling back federal red tape already, than any President in American history.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We unleashed American energy, and I\u2019m proud to report there\u2019s an energy renaissance happening across this country.\u00a0 And this year, for the first time in 75 years, America will be a net-exporter of oil.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We\u2019re on the road to energy independence.\nAnd in the midst of all of that, this President also pledged to fight for free, fair, and, what he likes to call, reciprocal trading agreements with our trading partners.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve been doing just that.\nThe results \u2014 I don\u2019t have to tell you, in a prospering company like Tyson \u2014 have truly been remarkable.\u00a0 Since Election Day 2016, businesses large and small across this country, in the city and on the farm, have literally created 6.5 million new jobs.\u00a0 That includes 130,000 jobs right here in the state of Tennessee.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn fact, we just confirmed on Friday that unemployment has now hit a 51-year low, and it\u2019s the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans.\u00a0 The American Dream is working again for every American.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd since President Trump was elected, the average American household has literally seen disposable income go up by more than $5,000 a year.\u00a0 And maybe most importantly to the President and me is that wages are rising at their fastest pace in a decade, and they\u2019re rising most rapidly for blue-collar, hardworking Americans.\u00a0 The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNow, all that didn\u2019t just happen.\u00a0 It happened because of the policies that Tennessee supported, because of our allies in Congress who came alongside this President as we were busy cutting taxes, rolling back red tape, unleashing American energy, and fighting for fair trade deals.\u00a0 They helped us put in place these policies that really revived the American economy.\nBut what really brought the economy back was all of you.\u00a0 It was that men and women \u2014 hardworking Americans in businesses just like Tysons \u2014 seized on the opportunities.\u00a0 You expanded freedom in the free market across this country to create jobs and opportunity.\nI mean, the truth of the matter is \u2014 the Governor will back me up on this \u2014 the people of Tennessee and America are the greatest workers in the world, and our businesses can compete with any business anywhere.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut it\u2019s all about the people.\u00a0 And Noel and I were talking about what a great team you have here.\u00a0 People like, I heard, someone who actually served alongside our armed forces overseas in Iraq.\u00a0 He\u2019s a man who grew up in Baghdad, and, after helping our troops in Operation Iraqi Freedom, he came to this country.\u00a0 He was actually an interpreter in Iraq.\nAnd once he arrived here, he got a job with Tyson.\u00a0 Within a year, I\u2019m told, he was promoted to management, and he\u2019s been promoted several more times in the 10 years that has followed.\u00a0 And now, he\u2019s an operations manager here at this facility, leading more than 1,600 employees every day.\u00a0 So would you would join me in a big round of applause for Falah Al-Sadawi.\u00a0 Where are you, Falah?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 What a good man.\u00a0 Thank you, Falah.\nAnd there\u2019s another person I was told about when I got here \u2014 a woman who grew up in a small town in Cuba.\u00a0 She had dreams of someday coming to America, enjoying the fruits of freedom.\u00a0 Twenty years ago, she fled the Castro regime in Havana and lived her dream coming to the United States.\u00a0\u00a0 A few years after that, she was hired by Tyson and given the opportunity she\u2019s had in this company.\u00a0 And now she\u2019s actually been promoted to production supervisor.\u00a0 So would you join me in another big round of applause for somebody out there living the dream here at Tyson: Lisette Martin.\u00a0 Where are you, Lisette?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Proud of you.\nWe\u2019re so grateful to Falah, we\u2019re so grateful to Lisette, for their example, for their courage, and for their incredible professionalism here at this company.\u00a0 And \u2014 but I mentioned each one of them, frankly, because they\u2019re just emblematic of all of you.\nI mean, the truth of the matter is that all the employees here at Tyson show every day that, as long as the playing field is level, American companies and workers can compete and win anywhere in the world.\u00a0 So give yourselves a round of applause, Team Tyson.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 You\u2019re the best.\nBut the President and I understand that opening up markets around the world is critical to the success of companies across this country \u2014 and most especially, it\u2019s true in agriculture.\u00a0 That\u2019s why, since the first day of this administration, President Trump has been working to open up markets around the world.\nWe negotiated a new trade agreement with South Korea. And earlier today, we announced that the Secretary of the Treasury and our Trade Representative are going to welcome a Chinese delegation, led by the Vice Premier, to continue negotiations this week.\nBut the President is going to continue to stand strong.\u00a0 We\u2019ve put China on notice that the era of economic surrender is over.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd I promise you \u2014 I promise you, this President is going to continue to stand firm, not just to open up markets to our goods in china, but to have China once again \u2014 \u201cfinally,\u201d rather \u2014 agree to embrace the international rules that govern commerce and protect American property and assets.\nNow, later this afternoon, there is also some good news.\u00a0 I think, before I leave Tyson today, the President is going to have signed two new agreements with Japan that will expand not only digital trade, but will expand agricultural exports by billions of dollars a year to Japan.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd we\u2019re in discussions with the European Union.\u00a0 Once the UK makes its way through Brexit, we\u2019ll be negotiating a free trade agreement with them.\u00a0 So we\u2019ve been very busy opening up markets.\nBut the USMCA is what brought me here today.\u00a0 Because the truth is, in negotiating the USMCA, the President did negotiate the largest trade deal in American history.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a win for agriculture, it\u2019s a win for Tennessee, and it\u2019s a win for America.\u00a0 And I came here today to call on the people of Tennessee to join us in this cause and let your voice be heard.\nThe truth is, according to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA is projected to add $68 billion to our economy and create 176,000 new jobs.\u00a0 And that\u2019s just in the early going.\u00a0 It\u2019s also estimated the USMCA would increase annual American agricultural exports by $2.2 billion.\nNow, I\u2019ve got to tell you: The numbers are impressive, but I think all of you here at Tyson know that means \u2014 that means jobs, that means prosperity in this company, in this state, in this nation.\u00a0 That\u2019s why I\u2019m traveling all over the country and the President is making the case that for the sake of the American farmer, for the sake of American business, we need Congress to pass the USMCA.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNow, the USMCA is also going to expand access to Canada\u2019s market for poultry, which is something Tyson knows more than a little bit about.\u00a0 Under the agreement, Canada would actually increase access to imports of American chicken by 10,000 metric tons within the first six years, and then increase it by one percent for the next 10 years.\nIn addition, it\u2019ll allow the United States to export up to 1,000 metric tons of turkey products every year for 10 years, and potentially a lot more than that.\nAccording to one estimate, poultry meat exports to Canada would increase by more than $180 million, or nearly 50 percent, within the six years after USMCA becomes law.\u00a0 And this is an extraordinary statement about what this is going to mean to producers and to companies just like Tyson and to all of the tens of thousands of Americans that are employed in this industry and around it.\nI mean, Tyson has a lot to gain in the USMCA.\u00a0 And, I mean, Mexico is actually, I\u2019m told, Tyson\u2019s top export market overall.\u00a0 And so, I wanted to come here and make sure all the good people working at Tyson knew just how important and how good this agreement would be for your industry.\u00a0 It\u2019s good for Tennessee, too.\nI mean, Tennessee already exports more than $7.8 billion in goods and services to Canada today.\u00a0 And under the USMCA, the Governor and I are confident that that number is only going to grow, which is going to create even more jobs, more opportunity, and more prosperity right here in Tennessee.\nAnd so, for the thousands of men and women of Tyson, for millions of citizens across Tennessee, and for America, we need to get this done; we need to pass the USMCA.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you what: This President is \u2014 he\u2019s impatient for it.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Because for all of the progress our country has made, that\u2019s just what this businessman-turned-President calls a \u201cgood start.\u201d\u00a0 I mean, the truth is, we need Congress to approve the USMCA and approve it this year because we want to keep the momentum in this economy.\nBut to make that happen \u2014 the reason I came to Tennessee today is because you all are going to be the difference.\u00a0 I mean, Congress knows where the President stands.\u00a0 Congress knows where I stand.\u00a0 But I want to encourage each and every one of you, maybe even before the day is out, to let your voice be heard and talk about what this agreement would mean not just to this company and to your family, but to this state and this nation.\nI mean, I want to encourage you to reach out to our elected officials who represent us in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 Tell them how this agreement is going to level the playing field.\u00a0 Those numbers that I just gave you are just the beginning.\u00a0 I mean, tell your elected officials how this agreement is going to lead to more jobs, more job security, more investment, right here in Tennessee.\nYou know, I served in Congress for 12 years.\u00a0 It seemed longer.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But the one thing I know is the most powerful force in Washington, D.C., is not your cable news networks, right?\u00a0 Not your social media.\u00a0 Not your special interests groups.\u00a0 The most powerful voice \u2014 force \u2014 in Washington, D.C., is the voice of the American people.\u00a0 So reach out to everyone who represents Tennessee in Washington, and tell them the Volunteer State needs the USMCA, and we need it this year.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 You can be the difference.\nBut let me say, with a grateful heart \u2014 I\u2019ll save you a nickel \u2014 you sure don\u2019t need to call Senator Lamar Alexander or Senator Marsha Blackburn because they are leading the charge for the USMCA in the United States Senate.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 They are.\u00a0 Two outstanding leaders; tremendously respected.\u00a0 And they\u2019re working the hallways, they\u2019re working the floor of the Senate, and they\u2019re working the airwaves of America, telling this story.\u00a0 You just call them and tell them you appreciate it.\nAnd also, there\u2019s a number of members of Congress that you don\u2019t need to call, several of which are actually with us today.\u00a0 They\u2019re strong, principled conservatives who have been there every step of the way with this administration.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to name them one at a time and ask them to stand.\nCongressman Chuck Fleischmann, would you stand up?\u00a0 This is a great, great voice for jobs and conservative values in Washington.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, Congressman.\nCongressman David Kustoff.\u00a0 Congressman, stand up.\u00a0 Thank you for your strong stand.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, David.\nCongressman John Rose has been there fighting the good fight to expand jobs and opportunities.\u00a0\u00a0(Applause.)\nAnd Congressman Tim Burchett.\u00a0 Stand up there, Tim, will you?\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThese are four conservative champions in the House of Representatives.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been fighting for the USMCA.\u00a0 And everyone in Tennessee can be proud of this group of congressmen.\u00a0 Give them one more round.\u00a0 This is a group of stars.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut there are a few members of your delegation that you could call.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 You know, and I kind of always had the view, when I was in Congress, that, you know, if you\u2019re part of a delegation from a state, you kind of represent everybody in the state, right?\u00a0 You\u2019re elected to a district, but you\u2019re part of your state\u2019s delegation.\nSo, right after you get done thanking the people that are standing with us, why don\u2019t you call Congressman Jim Cooper and call Congressman Steve Cohen, and tell them Tennessee needs the USMCA, and we need it this year.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd while you reach out to them directly, make sure \u2014 you know, let your voice be heard.\u00a0 I mean, send a letter to the Nashville Tennessean.\u00a0 Call a local talk radio show.\u00a0 Because I just really do believe, when the American people let their voice be heard \u2014 I used to call it the \u201cgale force wind of do something.\u201d\u00a0 When that hits Capitol Hill, Congress gets off the dime.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we need to have happen.\u00a0 For the sake of our economy and for the sake of our future prosperity, we\u2019ve got to get it done.\nMake no mistake about it: Your voice \u2014 your voice will make a difference.\u00a0 So let your voice be heard.\nNow, listen, I want to thank you for coming out today.\u00a0 I look forward to saying hello to as many of you as time permits.\u00a0 And I truly am grateful \u2014 I\u2019m grateful for the warm hospitality today.\u00a0 I really am.\nAnd while I\u2019m at it, can I just say, on behalf of myself and my family, to the people of Tennessee: Thank you for the privilege of being your Vice President.\u00a0 Thank you for the confidence you\u2019ve placed (inaudible).\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s the greatest honor of my life.\nAnd it\u2019s hard for me to describe the privilege that I feel in this role, and the confidence the people of Tennessee placed in this President and in his Vice President.\u00a0 And I never want to miss the opportunity to pay a debt of gratitude to each of you.\nAnd I promise you: Not only am I grateful, but you also have my promise that the President and I are going to keep on fighting.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to keep on fighting for all the things that Tennessee voted for this President to do.\u00a0 Things that we\u2019ve gotten done already that have revived this economy.\u00a0 We\u2019ve stood by American agriculture.\u00a0 We\u2019ve rebuilt our military.\u00a0 We\u2019ve appointed more than 150 conservatives to our federal courts at every level.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 America is standing strong and America is standing tall again, and we\u2019re going to keep fighting.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd I have faith that our best days are ahead \u2014 not just for Tennessee, but for all of America.\u00a0 Even in these divided times, I\u2019m absolutely convinced \u2014 I\u2019m absolutely convinced that as we continue to deliver on the timeless ideals of the American people, that the American people are going to keep standing with us.\u00a0 But we got to stay in it.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got to stay in the fight.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got to keep building on the momentum.\u00a0 That really is what today is all about.\nAnd we\u2019ve got to have faith in each other.\u00a0 And I think, if I can say, it\u2019s something that Bill Lee and I connected on early on, that we\u2019ve got to have that other kind of faith too.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYou know, I \u2014 it seems like you turn on the television anymore and there\u2019s so much emphasis on what divides us in this country, but I\u2019ll always believe that there will always be more that unites us in these United States than could ever divide us.\u00a0 And chief among those things is faith.\nI mean, everywhere I go \u2014 I heard it today when I got off the plane at the airport \u2014 people reaching out and grabbing a hand, people from every walk of life just telling you: \u201cTell the President and you, we\u2019re praying for you.\u201d\nI mean, this is a believing nation.\u00a0 And on that foundation, I think we can be confident that whatever challenges we face today, we\u2019ll find our way through as Americans to an even brighter future for our children and our grandchildren.\nAnd I can\u2019t help but think of how many times in that book I try and open every morning that they talk about the farmer.\u00a0 And I looked at a verse in James, Chapter Five, that said: Consider the farmer who patiently waits for the land to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting for the rain in the fall and in the spring, and you too must be patient and have courage.\nSo in these challenging times, let\u2019s consider the farmer.\u00a0 Let\u2019s continue to advance policies that will create prosperity for the farmer.\u00a0 But let\u2019s also be inspired by the steady example of faith and perseverance that has always been and will always be emblematic of the farm.\nSo I want to thank you for the opportunity to be with you today.\u00a0 And I\u2019m absolutely convinced that with your continued support, with your help and your voice, we\u2019ll get the USMCA passed into law.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to build on the momentum in this economy, making America more strong and more secure.\u00a0 And with President Donald Trump in the White House, and with God\u2019s help, we will keep America great.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThanks, everybody.\u00a0 God bless you.\u00a0 God bless Tennessee.\u00a0 And God bless America.\nEND\n2:11 P.M.

CDT\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, hello, Louisiana!\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you for that warm welcome.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:\u00a0 Four more years!\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:\u00a0 We love you!\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you for the choice Louisiana made in 2016.\u00a0 And I know Louisiana is going to give President Donald Trump four more years in 2020.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Four more years!\u00a0 Four more years!\u00a0 Four more years!\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you for that warm welcome.\u00a0 It\u2019s great to be here with so many friends.\u00a0 Thank you for that enthusiastic \u2014 enthusiastic response.\u00a0 But we\u2019re here to do some business, Louisiana.\u00a0 We\u2019re here to get some work done for the Republican cause, but let me thank a few people first.\nWould you all just join me in thanking a principled conservative who\u2019s emerged as one of the most respected voices in the United States Senate?\u00a0 My great friend, Senator Bill Cassidy.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And Bill and I are here.\u00a0 We\u2019re here as a part of this Louisiana Republican Unity Rally, because Republicans are unified in Louisiana.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to elect a Republican governor to Baton Rouge.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNow, we gather here because the time has come for every Republican in Louisiana to step up.\u00a0 The time has come for every Republican to step out and vote to send a Republican governor to the statehouse.\u00a0 After all, I ran into some great Republican women at the airport when I arrived and they were all wearing buttons that said, \u201cHappiness is a Republican governor,\u201d Louisiana.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 You guys are great.\nIt really is a joy to be with you today.\u00a0 Thanks for coming out on \u2014 even on an LSU football game day.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It really says a lot about your commitment to this state.\nIt\u2019s great to be here with so many friends.\u00a0 Let me mention a few.\u00a0 Another great conservative who represents this state with distinction every day, serves in the chamber I served in for 12 years, Congressman Garret Graves.\u00a0 Thank you so much for your strong stand.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And another principled conservative who represents all the ideals that make Louisiana great, Congressman Mike Johnson.\u00a0 Thank you, Mike.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 You have a great delegation in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 And today, here, it\u2019s rounded out by Congressman Clay Higgins, who does a terrific job.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, Clay.\u00a0 That\u2019s a strong team.\nLet me also thank your Secretary of State, Kyle Ardoin. (Applause.)\u00a0 Mayor Ben Zahn, from here in Kenner.\u00a0 And also, I want to thank Chairman Louis Gurvich and the whole state party team.\u00a0 I think they had two days to put this thing together and got all these great people out.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\u00a0 Great job.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We\u2019re on our way to victory.\nBut it\u2019s great to be in Louisiana.\u00a0 To be honest with you, this is such a special state.\u00a0 But next Friday, they\u2019ll be celebrating in Louisiana even just a little bit more when the Little League World Champion River Ridge team comes to the White House.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Congratulations, River Ridge.\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 How great is that?\nBut what brings us here today is a great opportunity for Louisiana and a great opportunity for the people of this state to vote today \u2014 to vote a week from today to make sure that you have strong Republican leadership, not just in the White House \u2014 like you voted in 2016 \u2014 but in the statehouse.\nAnd so, it\u2019s my great honor to be here with two great Republican candidates, one of whom I know will be the next governor of Louisiana.\u00a0 Would you join me in thanking a successful businessman, a job creator, a strong advocate for limited government who stepped up to lead Louisiana: Eddie Rispone.\u00a0 Thank you so much, Eddie.\u00a0 Thanks for stepping up.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, Eddie.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Eddie!\u00a0 Eddie!\u00a0 Eddie!\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And another good man \u2014 another good man vying for the same office: a strong conservative, lifelong Louisiana, a principled conservative who I\u2019ve come to know personally. \u00a0He\u2019s a member of the Army National Guard, and I can tell you, he\u2019s already emerged as one of the great champions for our armed forces on Capitol Hill.\u00a0 Join me in thanking congressman and doctor, Ralph Abraham.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, Ralph.\nI\u2019m here because I\u2019m for them.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And give them both another big round of applause, will you?\u00a0 These are two outstanding men.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you so much, Eddie.\u00a0 Thank you, Ralph.\u00a0 Thanks for stepping up for the state you love.\u00a0 Thanks for stepping up.\nAnd I\u2019m here because they\u2019re both right for Louisiana.\u00a0 But before the polls close today, vote Republican, Louisiana.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Louisiana deserves a Republican governor in the statehouse.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd while we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s make sure we reelect Billy Nungesser as your lieutenant governor.\u00a0 Thank you, Billy.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo I\u2019m here with some great friends and here with all of you.\u00a0 But before I get started, let me \u2014 let me bring greetings from another friend of mine.\u00a0 I told him yesterday, after we finished up a great event in the East Room, that I was headed to Louisiana, and I think he looked just a little bit jealous.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So let me bring greetings from a man who loves the state of Louisiana and has been fighting to keep the promises that he\u2019s made to the people of this state.\u00a0 I bring greetings from President Donald Trump.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe love Louisiana.\u00a0 Louisiana said yes to President Donald Trump in 2016.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And I\u2019m here because President Trump and I need Louisiana to say to the same kind of strong conservative leadership in next week\u2019s election.\u00a0 We need Louisiana to send a Republican to the governor\u2019s office in 2019, and we need Louisiana to vote for four more years of President Donald Trump in 2020.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut it all starts here and it all starts now.\u00a0 You know, after two and a half years of endless investigations, where the Do-Nothing Democrats have tried to overturn the will of the American people, I can tell you firsthand, Louisiana: President Trump has never stopped fighting for the agenda the people of Louisiana voted for, and we never will.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn fact, if you look at the last two and a half years, I think there\u2019s only one way you can describe it, because of the confidence the people of Louisiana placed in us: It\u2019s been two and a half years of action.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s been two and a half years of results.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s been two and a half years of promises made and promises kept.\u00a0 But we\u2019re just getting started, Louisiana.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThat\u2019s why we need strong Republican leadership in the governor\u2019s office and we need four more years of President Donald Trump.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It all works together.\nBut think about the progress that we\u2019ve all made together:\u00a0After the weakest economic recovery since the Great Depression \u2014 eight years where the most powerful economy in the history of the world didn\u2019t grow by more than 2 percent \u2014 President Trump knew we could do better.\u00a0 He promised to cut taxes, roll back regulations, unleash American energy, fight for free and fair trade.\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what this President has done.\nWe passed the largest tax cuts in American history.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 This President has rolled back more federal red tape than any President in the history of this country.\u00a0 We launched an American energy renaissance.\u00a0 And this year, America will be a net exporter of oil for the first time in 75 years.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe opened markets around the world to U.S. goods.\u00a0 And this President put China on notice: The era of economic surrender is over.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And soon, with the strong support of Senator Bill Cassidy, and your delegation in Congress, we\u2019re going to pass the largest trade deal in American history.\u00a0 The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement is ready to go.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd the result of all that: The American economy is booming.\u00a0 Just yesterday, we announced that since Election Day, businesses large and small, like those here in Louisiana, have created nearly 6.5 million new jobs, including 16,000 right here in your state.\nThe unemployment rate is at a 51-year low.\u00a0 And thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump and our allies in the Congress, more Americans are working today than ever before in American history.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd this President also promised to rebuild our military, after years of budget cutbacks, to restore the arsenal of democracy.\u00a0 And I can tell you, as a proud father of a United States Marine \u2014 (applause) \u2014 I couldn\u2019t be more proud to serve alongside a Commander-in-Chief who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and their families.\u00a0 President Trump has signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAs the President has said, thanks to the investments that we\u2019ve been able to make with strong allies in Congress, \u201cOur active-duty personnel are now the best-equipped, best-trained, and most\u2026advanced fighting force in the history of the world.\u201d\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe\u2019re finally giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and the support that they need to accomplish their mission, and we always will.\nAnd with that renewed American strength, I\u2019m proud to report, we\u2019re standing with our allies and standing up to our enemies.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe\u2019ve brought the rogue regime in North Korea to the negotiating table.\u00a0 Our NATO Allies are contributing more to our common defense than ever before.\nAnd our armed forces have taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists on our terms, on their soil, and this year, captured the last inch of territory controlled by the terrorist, ISIS.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd under this President, we\u2019ve not only stood with our military, but we\u2019ve stood with all of you who served in our military.\u00a0 And this President worked with the Congress, and we are finally giving our veterans access to the real-time, world-class healthcare that you earned in the uniform of the United States.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Veterans Choice is now available for every veteran.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn fact, I know there\u2019s an awful lot of people in Louisiana who served in our military.\u00a0 So if you have an opportunity, would you just mind \u2014 put your hand in the air if you served in our armed forces just so we can say thank-you one more time for your service to this country.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your service.\nAnd this President promised to support the men and women of law enforcement at every level, and we\u2019ve done just that.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 You know, you all have seen it on the news; it\u2019s \u2014 we live in a time when we\u2019re actually witnessing disgraceful acts of disrespect against law enforcement officers.\u00a0 But I\u2019ll promise you, this President, this Vice President, this party, and the American people will always stand with the men and women who serve on the Thin Blue Line.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYou know, when I arrived in Louisiana earlier today, I was reminded of the risks and the sacrifices that men and women in uniform, and their families, face every day as they protect our families.\u00a0 I had the great privilege to meet the family of a local hero who fell in the line of duty on September 20th.\u00a0 He left behind his wonderful wife Tracy, their seven children, including three who serve in the United States Marine Corps.\nThe captain was a leader in law enforcement and in his community.\u00a0 He was deeply respected by all who served with him throughout his 30 years in law enforcement.\nAnd as I told Tracy and his family today, America will never forget or fail to honor the service and sacrifice of Mandeville Police Department Captain Vincent Liberto, Jr.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI\u2019m so honored when I arrived here at this event to hear that his family is with us today.\u00a0 Would you all just \u2014 would you all just show his family just how much we appreciate and love you and are grateful for all your husband and your father has done for this country?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you all for that.\u00a0 And, Vin, you honor us by your presence today.\nThis President also promised and recognized that a nation without borders is not a nation.\u00a0 The President prom- \u2014 President Trump promised to secure our border and end the crisis of illegal immigration.\u00a0 And President Donald Trump is delivering.\u00a0 We\u2019ve made historic investments in border security, Mexico is doing more than ever before, apprehensions on or border are down by two thirds, and we\u2019ve already started to build that wall on the southern border of the United States.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd in support of the rule of law, this President also promised, back in 2016, that he would appoint strong and principled conservatives to our federal courts at every level.\u00a0 And once again, President Donald Trump delivered.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAs I stand before you today, this President has appointed more than 150 principled conservatives to our courts at every level, all of whom will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution \u2014 (applause) \u2014 like the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, and the right to keep and bear arms in the Second Amendment of the Constitution.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI\u2019ve met the \u2014 I met a lot of these judges; they\u2019re incredible men and women.\u00a0 And I didn\u2019t even mention Justice Neil Gorsuch or Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo we\u2019re standing for security and prosperity.\u00a0 We\u2019re standing for the rule of law and our constitutional liberties.\u00a0 And President Donald Trump has been delivering because we\u2019ve had partners in the Congress and in statehouses around the country.\u00a0 And it\u2019s really why I jumped on a plane to come out and be with all of you today, because it matters.\u00a0 It matters for the issues that we care about and it matters for our values.\nAnd I can\u2019t tell you \u2014 I couldn\u2019t be more proud to serve as Vice President to a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Am I right?\nAt a time when leading Democrats running for president advocate for late-term abortion and even defend infanticide \u2014 just yesterday, the Supreme Court agreed to hear Louisiana\u2019s strong pro-life law, and they\u2019ll make the decision this year.\u00a0 Thank you, Louisiana.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you for your stand.\nAnd I\u2019ll promise you, under this President and this Vice President, this party we will always stand for the unalienable right to life.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo in just two and a half years, America is winning again.\u00a0 And under President Donald Trump, we\u2019ve made America great again.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut to keep America great, we\u2019ve got work to do.\u00a0 And you all are about that right here in Louisiana, today.\u00a0 Early voting ends today and then you\u2019ll be back at it a week from today.\u00a0 And I\u2019m grateful for the enthusiasm I see here and that I hear about all across the state.\nI mean, we got work to do, men and women, but for starters, every Republican in Louisiana has to get out today, or a week from today, to send a Republican to the statehouse as your new governor.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s got to happen.\nYou got two great choices.\u00a0 And with strong Republican leadership at the helm in Louisiana, I know Louisiana is going to do your part.\u00a0 You can do your part this year to set the stage for a great victory next year when we give President Donald Trump four more years in the White House.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI mean, I can tell you all \u2014 you all get him, right?\u00a0 Isn\u2019t he something?\u00a0 He\u2019s really something.\u00a0 Some people think he and I are kind of different.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But I\u2019ll tell you what: We\u2019ve become very close friends.\u00a0 And I can tell you firsthand, the man I serve with every day \u2014 we have a President who loves this country, who never quits, who never back downs.\u00a0 He believes in you.\u00a0 He fights for you.\u00a0 And President Donald Trump believes in freedom.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s what you got.\u00a0 Believe in freedom.\nThen you\u2019ve got these Do-Nothing Democrats who\u2019ve spent the last two and a half years on endless investigations, and they\u2019re at it again.\u00a0 After two years of investigations, it found no collusion, no obstruction.\nLast week \u2014 you all saw it in the news \u2014 the Do-Nothing Democrats \u2014 Do-Nothing Democrats launched a partisan impeachment inquiry in a blatant attempt to overturn the will of the American people in the last election.\u00a0 But I think you all see through it.\u00a0 The American people see through it.\nAnd I\u2019ll make you a promise: Whatever the Democrats and their allies in the media want to spend their time doing, President Donald Trump and I are never going to stop fighting for the agenda that Louisiana voted for in 2016.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI mean, the choice \u2014 the choice here in Louisiana this week and next year couldn\u2019t be clearer, but the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher.\nI mean, just look at all those Democrats running for President.\u00a0 I mean, I watched that last debate.\u00a0 I mean, those people were standing far on the Left, I thought that stage was going to tip over.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Didn\u2019t you?\u00a0 I mean, when they aren\u2019t talking about a government takeover of healthcare, they\u2019re talking about open borders.\u00a0 When they aren\u2019t talking about higher taxes, they\u2019re talking about taking firearms away from law-abiding citizens.\nI mean, the truth is, the Democratic Party today is dominated by left-wing radicals who want policies like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All and sanctuary cities and free healthcare for illegal immigrants.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Booo \u2014\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And worst of all, they advocate an economic system that\u2019s impoverished millions of people around the world and robbed the liberties of generations.\u00a0 And that system is socialism.\nYou know, I never thought I\u2019d live to see the day that one of the two major parties in this country actually openly advocated a system so antithetical to the principles \u2014 economic principles and liberties as socialism is.\nBut I think you all in Louisiana know: It was freedom, not socialism, that gave us the most prosperous nation in the history of the world.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIt was freedom, not socialism, that ended slavery, won two World Wars, and stands today as a beacon of hope for all the world.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThe moment America becomes a socialist country is the moment America ceases to be America.\u00a0 So it falls on all of us, on this occasion in Louisiana this year, and all of next year, to say as the President said in his State of the Union Address, with one voice: America will never be a socialist country!\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 USA!\u00a0 USA!\u00a0 USA!\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And you got an opportunity, folks, before the polls close today and a week from today.\u00a0 I mean, if you\u2019ve had enough of the Do-Nothing Democrats, vote Republican.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nLouisiana, if you want to send a message to Washington, D.C., send a Republican governor to Baton Rouge.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMen and women of Louisiana, you have a chance to send a message that Louisiana supports Republican leadership in the statehouse and Louisiana supports President Donald Trump.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 So let\u2019s do it.\u00a0 Let\u2019s send the message.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we got to get done, and it\u2019s going to take all of us to do it.\nAnd, Louisiana, I know you got your work cut out for you, but there\u2019s still time left today.\u00a0 I mean, you got two great candidates for governor, but I need you to do just a couple of things and then I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m going to have a chance to meet as many of you as time permits.\nAnd while I\u2019m at it, can I just \u2014 on behalf on my wife Karen and our family, can I just say to all of you here in Louisiana, thank you for the privilege of being your Vice President.\u00a0 It is the greatest honor of my life.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\nBut before I leave, I\u2019m going to give you an assignment, okay?\u00a0 So if you\u2019re taking notes, get ready.\nNumber one, vote, Louisiana.\u00a0 Vote Republican in the governor\u2019s race.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I checked before I got off the plane; early voting ends today at 6:00 p.m.\u00a0 That means you got about three hours and three minutes.\u00a0 You could leave here, you could go to the Jefferson Registrar\u2019s Office, 408 Minor Street.\u00a0 Mayor, right here in Kenner, right?\u00a0 Not hard to find.\nAnd when you vote, remember: Friends don\u2019t let friends vote alone.\u00a0 Grab a friend and head out to vote today, and vote Republican in the governor\u2019s race.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo, if you\u2019re taking notes, remember: Vote.\u00a0 All right?\u00a0 Bring a friend.\u00a0 Right?\nAnd number three, every day between now and when the polls close a week from today, just go tell the story.\u00a0 Tell the story of what we\u2019ve accomplished by having strong Republican leadership, from the White House to the Capitol, representing Louisiana.\u00a0 Tell people what more we can accomplish with strong Republican leadership in the statehouse.\u00a0 I mean, the simple truth of the matter is: Elections have consequences.\nThe people of Louisiana said \u201cyes\u201d to President Donald Trump in 2016, and you paved the way to make America great again.\u00a0 But now you have an opportunity to tell your neighbors and friends that Louisiana has an opportunity today and a week from today to vote Republican for governor in Louisiana and pave the way to keep America great!\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo go tell your neighbors and friends.\u00a0 Tell them what they\u2019re not hearing on most of their major cable television stations every day.\u00a0 I mean, tell them we cut their taxes, right?\u00a0 Tell them we rebuilt the military.\u00a0 Tell them we\u2019re standing for all the God-given liberties that the people of Louisiana and America cherish.\u00a0 Tell them we put \u2014 tell them we\u2019re building that wall.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Tell them we put Washington, D.C. back to work for them, not the other way around.\u00a0 Tell them that you need the same kind of leadership in Baton Rouge in the governor\u2019s office.\u00a0 So, vote Republican. (Applause.)\nYou know, because I\u2019ll always believe when I think back on 2016, Senator, I\u2019ll always believe that what made the difference was all of you, in this state and in states all across the union, that people were talking to one another.\nYou know, I hold the view that the most powerful media in this country is now, and always has been, not your television, your radio, not your mail pieces, not your social media, but it\u2019s word of mouth.\u00a0 It\u2019s when someone who knows you and respects you hears from you about a worthy candidate or a cause that\u2019s important to them.\nSo I want to encourage you to let your voice be heard and just tell them \u2014 say, \u201cYou know, I went out on Saturday afternoon.\u00a0 I watched the score on my phone.\u00a0 I attended this rally, I ran into Mike\u201d \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 \u201cand he told me it was absolutely vital that we have Republican leadership in the statehouse, and that by electing a Republican governor in 2019, Louisiana can do more than its share to set the stage for a great victory in America in 2020.\u201d\u00a0 So go tell them!\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Go tell them what we\u2019ve done.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Tell them that how they vote, Louisiana, this week will make a difference for this state and this nation.\nAnd, finally, before I leave, I\u2019d ask one other thing if you\u2019re of a mind.\u00a0 If you occasionally bow the head and bend the knee, I think the next week, the next year, would be a good time to do that.\u00a0 You know, it seems like \u2014 it seems like many in the media focus on more on what divides this country than what unites us.\u00a0 But I\u2019ll always believe that there will always be more that unites the people of these United States than will ever divide us.\u00a0 And chief among those things is faith.\nAnd so I\u2019d encourage you as I close: While I\u2019m here to tell you you\u2019ve got two great candidates and I need you to get out before the end of the day, or a week from today, and vote Republican for governor, I\u2019d just encourage you to avail yourself of that wellspring of strength that Americans have always turned to in much more challenging times than we could ever imagine.\nBecause I always believe that those ancient words that Americans have clung to throughout our history are just as true today: that if His people, who are called by His name, will humble themselves and pray, He\u2019ll do like he\u2019s always done through the long and storied history of this great nation.\u00a0 He\u2019ll hear from heaven, He\u2019ll heal this land, this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 So pray for America.\u00a0 Louisiana, pray for America, because it\u2019ll make a difference.\nAnd as this campaign goes forward in the next week, I\u2019m leaving here very encouraged and very excited.\u00a0 And I encourage each one of you to go out and do your thing today.\u00a0 If you haven\u2019t voted yet, I told you \u2014 Mayor, did I give them the right directions?\u00a0 Headed that way, open until six.\u00a0 Or make it happen a week from today.\nBut I\u2019m absolutely convinced, if the people of Louisiana will all step up and elect the kind of strong and principled leadership to the governor\u2019s office in Baton Rouge, if we reelect great Republican leadership at every level across this country, that with President Donald Trump in the White House and with God\u2019s help, we\u2019re going to make Louisiana and America more prosperous than you could possibly imagine, we\u2019re going to make Louisiana and America safer than ever before, and we\u2019re going to keep America great.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThank you very much.\u00a0 God bless Louisiana, and God bless America.\u00a0 And let\u2019s get out there and vote Republican!\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEND\n2:05 P.M. CDT\n"

in this room.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 You just broke the record.\u00a0 Unbelievable.\nWell, I want to thank you all.\u00a0 And I have a lot of friends, but \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and this is a place.\u00a0 1799 it was built.\u00a0 1799.\u00a0 Started off with number six \u2014 John Adams, President.\u00a0 And so, it\u2019s a long time.\u00a0 It\u2019s the White House, and we love it, and it\u2019s an honor to have you.\nBut you really did \u2014 you broke the sound barrier.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never heard that.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never heard it quite like that, and I appreciate it.\u00a0 We

incredibly talented and unbelievable, patriotic, young American leaders.\u00a0 You\u2019re going to be the leaders.\nSomebody \u2014 I would be almost willing to bet, maybe even willing to bet \u2014 somebody in that audience, right here, right in front of me, is going to be standing here someday.\u00a0 I think so.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\u00a0 You\u2019ve got a good shot.\u00a0 You\u2019re going to have a good shot.\u00a0 You\u2019ve done incredible work to get to this position, and I have tremendous respect for it.\nWe\u2019re glad to be joined by our terrific Vice President, Mike Pence.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And many of our Cabinet members are here.\u00a0 They wanted to be here.\u00a0 I told a couple of them, \u201cDon\u2019t have to.\u00a0 Don\u2019t worry about it.\u00a0 What the heck.\u00a0 These are my friends.\u201d\u00a0 They said, \u201cNo, we want to be here.\u201d\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 So we have a lot of our Cabinet members here.\nAnd to every young person: You represent America\u2019s future.\u00a0 You are the best and the brightest, the bravest and boldest, and someday you are going to be setting records like nobody before.\u00a0 I\u2019m telling you, I know it.\u00a0 I know where\u2019s it\u2019s at.\u00a0 I know where energy is, and you have the energy like very few people have the energy.\u00a0 So I just want to tell you: Get out there.\u00a0 Prove me right, please.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Prove me right.\u00a0 I have no doubt you will.\nEach of you has come to Washington for the Black Leadership Summit because you have \u2014 (applause) \u2014 what it takes to achieve real change on your campuses and in your communities, and that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been doing, and that\u2019s actually why you\u2019re here.\nYou speak out for the values and principles that have made America the most exceptional nation anywhere on Earth.\u00a0 And I will say this today: It\u2019s greater than it ever was before \u2014 our military, our economy.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We have the greatest economy in the world.\u00a0 We have the greatest economy we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 Tremendous numbers just came out today.\u00a0 You heard that.\nBut you stand up for the oppressive forces \u2014 and you do.\u00a0 You stand right up to those forces in our country that demand conformity and control.\u00a0 You refuse to be censored, you refuse to be silenced, and you will never back down.\u00a0\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And don\u2019t.\u00a0 Don\u2019t ever back down.\nYou\u2019re the champions for free thought and free speech.\u00a0 And I especially want to thank a friend of mine who is \u2014 I mean, first of all, you think he\u2019s like 50, but he\u2019s about 25 or something like that.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 He\u2019s a young guy.\u00a0 I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t even imagine being so successful at such a young age.\u00a0 What he\u2019s done in so many ways \u2014 and, really, more importantly, letting young people know that they have a voice.\u00a0 Charlie Kirk, from Turning Point U.S.A.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nCharlie, you\u2019ve done a fantastic job.\u00a0 Fastest-growing organization of thought \u2014 of thought \u2014 in the country.\u00a0 He is something.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Charlie.\u00a0 I appreciate your being here.\nAnd we\u2019re also joined by a friend of mine \u2014 just got married \u2014 (applause) \u2014 just got married.\u00a0 And Candace Owens \u2014 I watched her, and I saw her coming.\u00a0 I said \u2014 you know, I\u2019m pretty good at star power.\u00a0 I look, and I say, \u201cThat\u2019s a star.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Every once in a while, I\u2019ll see somebody.\u00a0 You know, it happens about once every five years.\u00a0 That\u2019s all it is.\u00a0 But I\u2019ll be watching.\u00a0 I saw Candace probably three, four years ago.\u00a0 How long would it be, Charlie?\u00a0 Four?\u00a0 Maybe four.\u00a0 I saw this woman on television.\u00a0 I said, \u201cMan, I don\u2019t want to mess with her.\u00a0 She\u2019s tough.\u00a0 She\u2019s tough.\u201d\nNow, I\u2019m not allowed to say it \u2014 you know that.\u00a0 I\u2019m not allowed to say it anymore, but she\u2019s also beautiful.\u00a0 So, I\u2019ll say that, too.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Okay?\nIt\u2019s true.\u00a0 Under the #MeToo generation, we\u2019re not allowed to say it.\u00a0 So, all of you young, brilliant guys: Never ever call a woman beautiful, please.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 You\u2019re not allowed to do it.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve kept doing it, and I\u2019ve never been told by that woman never to do it.\u00a0 Just say, \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nCandace, would you come up here, and say a few words?\u00a0 Do you mind?\u00a0 Come.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, Candace.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMS. OWENS:\u00a0 You know what?\u00a0 I was thinking: Every single President that comes into office, after two years, they look so much older.\u00a0 He seems to be the only President that\u2019s getting younger.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Is he \u2014 I mean, like, he has somehow found a fountain of youth.\u00a0 I think he gets up out of bed \u2014 it\u2019s the fight.\u00a0 He loves the fight.\u00a0 He really does.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We have no choice.\nMS. OWENS:\u00a0 We are \u2014 we are \u2014 we are so blessed.\u00a0 And, listen, let me say this: The media \u2014 the audacity of them to think that they\u2019re going to impeach our President.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Booo \u2014\nMS. OWENS:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 It\u2019s not happening.\u00a0 It\u2019s absolutely not happening.\u00a0 Not under our watch.\u00a0 We need to make sure we fight for this man \u2014 the one man who is standing up for Black America, we are going to fight for, guys.\u00a0 We have to keep it going.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you, Candace.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 That\u2019s so nice.\u00a0 Outstanding person.\u00a0 She\u2019s another one.\u00a0 You\u2019re going to have to compete with her, too, for this position, I suspect.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nYou know, it\u2019s sort of interesting.\u00a0 It\u2019s like: Do we have a choice?\u00a0 We have to fight, right?\u00a0 We have to fight.\u00a0 We have to fight for everything, whether we like it or not.\nAnother man who has been so incredible \u2014 Ja\u2019Ron Smith.\u00a0 Where is Ja\u2019Ron?\u00a0 Is he around here?\u00a0 Ja\u2019Ron Smith.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Man, have you done a job.\u00a0 You\u2019ve done such a great job, Ja\u2019Ron.\u00a0 At least come up and shake my hand, will you, please?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Come here, Ja\u2019Ron.\nYou know, he works with us, and he\u2019s actually not \u2014 I always say he\u2019s so elegant and so quiet and so nice.\u00a0 They say, \u201cYou don\u2019t know the real Ja\u2019Ron.\u201d\u00a0 So I want to see that.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But what he does and the job he\u2019s done on outreach and so many other aspects of our lives is incredible.\u00a0 I want to thank you, Ja\u2019Ron.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I want to thank you for that.\u00a0 I appreciate it.\u00a0 Thank you.\nAnd Ja\u2019Ron knows what I\u2019m about to do because \u2014 a man who I met on Twitter, or, as we would say, \u201csocial media\u201d; he is some piece of work, this guy \u2014 he was hitting Debra Messing like she never got hit before.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 This crazy Debra Messing started messing with us.\u00a0 And all of a sudden, I see this man on Twitter, and I see him all over.\u00a0 And he was hitting her and I never saw anything like it.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I felt so sorry for her.\nAnd then, I look and I say, \u201cWho is this guy?\u201d\u00a0 His name is Terrence Williams.\u00a0 I look \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and I look and I said, \u201cWell, you know, the way you look\u2026\u201d\u00a0 And the first thing I look is, how many followers does he have?\u00a0 And he had like 700,000 followers.\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhoa.\u201d\nYou know, oftentimes I\u2019ll be impressed by somebody.\u00a0 I\u2019ll look and they have three followers, they say.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I say, \u201cWe have to wait for him or her.\u201d\u00a0 But this guy has a following like very few people.\u00a0 And I want to just thank you because I\u2019m a fan of yours, also.\u00a0 You\u2019re a very successful guy.\u00a0 Say a few words.\u00a0 Please.\nMR. WILLIAMS:\u00a0 Thank you, President Trump.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Yeah, let me \u2014 yeah, this is a little too tall for me.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nFirst of all, I just want to say I love President Donald J. Trump.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 The media is attacking him.\u00a0 But when they attack him, they are attacking us.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Because he is out here fighting for us.\u00a0 And they are harassing you, Mr. President, so they are harassing me.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd I want to say one more thing here.\u00a0 A while back, President Trump said, when he was talking to the black community, \u201cIf you vote for me, what do you have to lose?\u201d Because the do-nothing Democrats have done nothing for the black community.\u00a0 2020 is around the corner and we have a lot to lose now because President Donald J. Trump has done so much for the black community. \u00a0Thank you, President Trump.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\nHe is something.\u00a0 And he\u2019s a talented, talented guy.\u00a0 And when he started talking, I wasn\u2019t \u2014 man, I watched it once.\u00a0 I watched it twice.\u00a0 And then I called the First Lady over.\u00a0 I say, \u201cWhat do you think of this guy?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Thank you very much, Terrence.\u00a0 We appreciate it a lot.\nWe come together at a time of extraordinary opportunity for our nation.\u00a0 Thanks to our pro-American agenda, the economy is booming, wages are rising, and poverty is plummeting.\u00a0 We have the best economy we\u2019ve ever had, and believe me, we\u2019re just getting started.\u00a0 We have such potential.\u00a0 Such potential.\nLast month, the unemployment rate dropped to the lowest level in over 51 years \u2014 (applause) \u2014 3.5 percent.\u00a0 People didn\u2019t think they were going to see that a couple of years ago.\u00a0 If I would\u2019ve said that, the fake news would\u2019ve said, \u201cThis guy is exaggerating.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nWages are up by almost 3 percent in the last three years. When I was campaigning three years ago, and people were making less and less and less \u2014 they were making less three years ago.\u00a0 You go back 20 years from then, they used to make more money with one job than they made with two or three jobs.\u00a0 And now, for the first time in many, many years, wages are rising again.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThe unemployment rate for African Americans is at the lowest it\u2019s ever been in the history of our country.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd African American youth unemployment \u2014 young, African American talented people recently reached the lowest rate ever recorded.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 So how do we lose that debate?\u00a0 We\u2019ll be up and somebody will say, \u201cI\u2019m going to do this.\u201d\u00a0 I say, \u201cFolks, how old is your country?\u201d\u00a0 African American \u2014 the best numbers you\u2019ve ever, ever had.\u00a0 And I could go into plenty of other numbers.\u00a0 For the first time ever, as an example, the most new hires of prime working age are minorities and women. (Applause.)\u00a0 The African American poverty rate has reached its lowest level in the history of our country, so that\u2019s good.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd they\u2019re working hard, they\u2019re finding jobs and they\u2019re getting good jobs.\u00a0 And if you don\u2019t like that job, you can get another one because you have a lot of choice.\u00a0 It\u2019s like the military; we got them Choice in the VA.\u00a0 They can go find another doctor.\u00a0 They can go out \u2014 you know, by the way, just because a lot of people are vets \u2014 the vets were treated horribly.\u00a0 You don\u2019t hear that anymore.\u00a0 You don\u2019t hear it.\nNow, they\u2019ll go out and find some vet somewhere in this country that isn\u2019t happy.\u00a0 And that person will become a star overnight, right?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But you don\u2019t hear it anymore.\nBut we did a thing called Choice.\u00a0 And that\u2019s where people were waiting \u2014 our great veterans were waiting for two days, five days, five weeks, months to get a doctor.\u00a0 Now they don\u2019t\u00a0 have to wait at all.\u00a0 They go outside, they get a good doctor of their choice, and the doctor gives us a bill, we pay the bill.\nAnd you know, the least important thing is it actually costs us less.\u00a0 That\u2019s the least important.\u00a0 The most important thing is we take care of our vets.\u00a0 Our vets were dying waiting to see a doctor.\u00a0 They\u2019d go in \u2014 think of this.\u00a0 I mean, many of you, you go see a doctor.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that big a deal.\u00a0 They would go see a doctor and they\u2019d be waiting on line for weeks.\u00a0 And they\u2019d be sick, but not bad.\nBy the time they saw the doctor, they\u2019d be terminally ill.\u00a0 And we don\u2019t do that anymore.\nSo it\u2019s a big thing.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been trying to get this approved by \u2014 for over, I guess, Mike, over 45 years, and we got it done.\u00a0 We\u2019re good at getting things done.\u00a0 And how much sense does it make?\u00a0 So, it\u2019s good.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo you have Choice, also.\u00a0 You have choice in your jobs.\u00a0 You don\u2019t like your job, you go out.\u00a0 We have a great economy.\u00a0 You go out, get another one.\u00a0 And it\u2019s incredible how well you\u2019re doing.\nOur agenda is lifting up citizens of every background, race, religion, color, and creed.\u00a0 But while we are fighting every day to build up our nation, the far-left only wants to wreck, ruin, and destroy our nation.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Booo \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And you know better than anybody: For the last three years, Democrat lawmakers, their deep-state cronies, the fake news media, they\u2019ve been colluding in their effort to overturn the presidential election \u2014 63 million people voted \u2014 and to nullify the votes of the American people.\u00a0 And many African American people voted for Trump even then.\u00a0 Now they like me more, because I said I was going to do it and now I did it.\u00a0 So you better vote.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I said I was going to do it.\u00a0 I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to do it.\u201d\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Four more years!\u00a0 Four more years!\u00a0 Four more years!\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 But you remember, I\u2019d make speeches and I\u2019d go through a list.\u00a0 I\u2019d be talking about the African American community and I\u2019d go through a list of worst poverty levels ever, worst crime ever, worst schools ever, worst this.\u00a0 I\u2019d go through 10 things.\u00a0 I\u2019d read off from a list.\nAnd at one big rally \u2014 I had 25,000 people \u2014 I said, \u201cGo with me.\u00a0 What the hell do you have to lose?\u201d\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Remember that, Candace?\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u00a0 You\u2019re doing the worst in every category.\u00a0 You\u2019re getting just \u2014 it\u2019s terrible.\u00a0 What the hell do you have to lose?\u201d\nAnd I\u2019ll never forget, I got off stage and my people came: \u201cSir, that wasn\u2019t very nice.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s true.\u201d\u00a0 What do they have to lose?\u00a0 And you went with me, and I did get a good vote, I have to say.\u00a0 You went with me, and now you have the best employment numbers you\u2019ve ever had, the best numbers, the best poverty numbers.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s good.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut the radical Democrats are willing to do anything to smear anyone and to lie about everything in their craven quest for power and money and other things, I guess.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to tell you what those other things are, but they\u2019re not good.\u00a0 Although, maybe when the cameras shut off, we\u2019ll talk.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nThey\u2019re trying to steal your vote.\u00a0 They\u2019re trying to steal your voice and steal your country.\u00a0 They\u2019re trying to steal your country.\u00a0 And they don\u2019t have what it takes.\u00a0 \u201cShifty Schiff.\u201d How about \u201cShifty Schiff\u201d?\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Booo \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 He got four Pinnochios today in the Washington Post.\u00a0 He lies like a son of a gun.\u00a0 He\u2019s been lying for three years.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut we will never let that happen, where they take away your country.\u00a0 We will uphold the sacred principle of government by and for the people.\u00a0 That\u2019s you.\u00a0 The corrupt forces in Washington \u2014 and they are corrupt \u2014 and that includes the media, because large parts of the media \u2014 not all of it.\u00a0 You have some great journalists, reporters.\u00a0 But large portions of the media are corrupt, perpetrating these hoaxes like never before.\nThe very same people who have made a living selling out American workers to foreign countries.\u00a0 They were closing the factories.\u00a0 You\u2019re losing your jobs.\u00a0 They leave our country, they make the product, they sell the product in.\u00a0 No tax, no nothing.\u00a0 So we ended up with empty factories and no jobs, by the thousands, by the tens of thousands, and jobs by the millions.\nThese are the same bought and paid-for politicians who let special interests write the laws, who push trade policies to enrich foreign nations, and who beg far-left judges to rewrite the Constitution of the United States to impose their their own extreme ideology.\nNo one in America has been hurt more as a result of the Democrats\u2019 corrupt leadership and socialist policies than our nation\u2019s African American communities.\u00a0 It\u2019s true.\u00a0 That\u2019s true.\u00a0 It\u2019s true.\u00a0 For a hundred years \u2014 for a hundred years, African Americans have gone with the Democrats.\u00a0 Has it worked?\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 No!\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Has it worked?\u00a0 For \u2014 actually, I guess, Candace, it\u2019s even more \u2014 but a hundred years.\u00a0 And you look at what\u2019s going on in the cities run by these crazy left Democrats, and what\u2019s going on is not good.\nMy administration is fighting with everyone, and all our heart \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 to reverse the pain inflicted by Democrat leaders and to deliver hope and opportunity and prosperity for all Americans, but for African American communities all throughout our land.\nTogether, we will express the corruption, we will defeat the socialists, we will defraud.\u00a0 And I tell you what: We will do what we have to do, but we will stop defrauding all of the people in our country, because they\u2019ve defrauded the people in our country.\u00a0 We\u2019ll defend democracy.\u00a0 And, yes, we will drain the swap.\u00a0 But that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAfrican Americans built this nation \u2014 (applause) \u2014 you built this nation.\u00a0 You know, you\u2019re just starting to get real credit for that, okay?\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if you know that.\u00a0 You\u2019re just starting to get \u2014 you built the nation.\u00a0 We all built it.\u00a0 But you were such a massive part of it \u2014 bigger than you were given credit for.\u00a0 Does that make sense?\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 But with Candace around and Terrence, that\u2019s not going to happen for long.\u00a0 (Laughs.)\nBut through generations of blood, sweat, and tears and \u2014 you deserve a government that defends your interests, protects your families, and cares for our own citizens first.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYou know, at the border, where they want the open policies \u2014 they want open borders.\u00a0 They don\u2019t want walls.\u00a0 They actually do want walls, but because I want it \u2014 you know, I know how I can get the wall.\u00a0 If I announce tomorrow, \u201cI don\u2019t want a wall,\u201d the Democrats would come out in favor of the wall.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I should\u2019ve thought of that two years ago.\u00a0 But the wall is being built.\u00a0 It would\u2019ve been a lot easier.\u00a0 \u201cWe don\u2019t want the wall.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe want the wall.\u201d\u00a0 I say, \u201cAll right, go ahead and build.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nOur philosophy is grounded in the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that unite all Americans.\u00a0 And we really have been united.\u00a0 It\u2019s been an incredible thing.\u00a0 A lot of great things have been happening.\u00a0 You don\u2019t necessarily see it at the top of government, where the hatred is tremendous \u2014 the hatred toward us.\u00a0 And a lot of it is because of the success.\u00a0 We\u2019re having such success.\u00a0 We\u2019re showing them what\u2019s going on \u2014 when you look at your unemployment numbers, how great they are.\u00a0 The best in history.\u00a0 You look at your employment numbers.\u00a0 You look at the poverty numbers.\u00a0 You look at all of the things that have been so beneficial, it\u2019s driving them crazy, because they never produced numbers like that.\u00a0 And they\u2019re losing African American votes, and they can\u2019t do that.\u00a0 They just can\u2019t do that.\u00a0 They haven\u2019t done anything for you.\u00a0 They haven\u2019t done anything. A hundred years \u2014 they haven\u2019t done anything.\nAt long last, you have a government that puts Americans first, puts you first, puts your families and your communities first.\nWe\u2019re adopting \u201cBuy American\u201d trade policies to stand up for our workers.\u00a0 Our tax and regulatory reforms are stopping the outsourcing of jobs, where they outsource all your jobs to other countries, and keeping businesses in America where they belong.\u00a0 And keep your jobs where your jobs belong.\u00a0 We\u2019re fighting every day to secure our nation\u2019s borders and to achieve an immigration system that prioritizes American families, wage-earners, taxpayers, and people that can help you and can help our country.\nTo keep our cities safe, we\u2019re supporting the brave men and women of ICE, and Border Patrol, and law enforcement.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And you\u2019d be amazed at how many African American people come up, and they have people living near them that are brutal killers.\u00a0 They\u2019re killers.\u00a0 But you\u2019re tough; you fight back.\u00a0 But sometimes you don\u2019t win those fights, because these guys are tough, too.\u00a0 They shouldn\u2019t be in our country.\u00a0 And it\u2019s really amazing to see what some of our law enforcement does and how much they love you.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the fact.\u00a0 That\u2019s the fact.\u00a0 And we\u2019re lucky to have them.\nTo revitalize distressed neighborhoods, we created something that I\u2019m very proud of.\u00a0 Tim Scott, South Carolina.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 You know Tim?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Tim Scott has to get a lot of credit.\u00a0 He came to me with Jared, and he said, \u201cSo, we\u2019d like to do Opportunity Zones.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u00a0 But once he told me, I said, \u201cMaybe that would work.\u201d\nAnd I think, Jared, it\u2019s one of the great \u2014 it\u2019s one of the great unknowns of the successes that we have.\u00a0 Thousands and thousands of zones in inner cities and poor neighborhoods.\u00a0 Tremendous investments going in.\u00a0 Tremendous jobs are happening. Revitalization is happening.\u00a0 It\u2019s been incredible for the African American community.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been anything.\u00a0 It\u2019s early yet.\u00a0 It\u2019s a year and a half.\u00a0 But, Ja\u2019Ron, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had anything quite like it.\u00a0 And people don\u2019t like writing about it because they don\u2019t want to give the Trump administration credit.\u00a0 But I\u2019m used to that.\u00a0 I\u2019m used to it.\u00a0 You got to get used to it.\nYou know who knows, though?\u00a0 The people know.\u00a0 The people know.\u00a0 But because no \u2014\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBecause, really, no American community is going to be left behind.\u00a0 Any community.\nTo help former prisoners get a second chance at life \u2014 (applause) \u2014 we passed groundbreaking \u2014 and this is with liberals and conservatives \u2014 some of the most conservative people in the Republican Party were so in favor of it.\u00a0 Senator Lee \u2014 Mike Lee, of Utah, great guy.\u00a0 Senator Grassley, great guy \u2014 Iowa.\u00a0 So many people.\nCriminal justice reform.\u00a0 Everybody said it couldn\u2019t be done.\u00a0 And a group came to my office, \u201cSir, please.\u00a0 Please, would you help us?\u201d\u00a0 These were liberal people.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cI will.\u201d\u00a0 Van Jones was one.\u00a0 Nice guy.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t say treats me too good, but that\u2019s okay.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Van Jones.\u00a0 And he said, \u201cSir, we need your help.\u00a0 We can\u2019t get five senators.\u00a0 We can\u2019t get this, we can\u2019t get that.\u00a0 We need your help.\u00a0 We need your help.\u00a0 Please, sir, help me!\u00a0 Please, help me!\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nI said, \u201cI can get you those five senators.\u201d\u00a0 And I called five or six or seven, to get the five.\u00a0 Sometimes you have to call a little more than the five if you want to get the five, right?\u00a0 You\u2019ll learn.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 A couple said, \u201cCould I take a pass on this, sir?\u201d\u00a0 But I got five people.\u00a0 Right, Jared?\u00a0 And we got the vote, and people were shocked.\u00a0 And nobody else could\u2019ve done it.\nAnd they\u2019ve been trying to change this for the African American community, for the Hispanic community, for other communities, but, really, the African American and Hispanic communities, by far, benefitted the most.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve been trying to do this for decades.\u00a0 It started with the Clintons.\u00a0 It was not good.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 Remember when she ran and she \u2014\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Booo \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, remember when she ran and she had that young African American woman who was tough?\u00a0 Maybe it was Candace.\u00a0 Could that have been you, Candace?\u00a0 (Laughter.) But \u2014 no, I don\u2019t think so.\nBut I remember how she was so angry at Hillary Clinton.\u00a0 But they passed that.\u00a0 And it was horrible for the black community, for a lot of communities, but in particular black and Hispanic and some others.\u00a0 And I said to a senator, \u201cIt\u2019s a great thing.\u00a0 We got to do it.\u201d\u00a0 People are in jail for 40, 50, 60 years for a crime that isn\u2019t even a crime today.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:\u00a0 Right!\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 Isn\u2019t that right?\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Yes!\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Our friend, Jared \u2014 we have number of them, but we helped a couple of our friends \u2014 a lot of our friends now.\u00a0 We pardoned certain people.\u00a0 Who you would say, Ja\u2019Ron?\u00a0 Who would you say in particular?\u00a0 Go ahead.\u00a0 Give me a couple of names, because we had \u2014 you know, who I\u2019m talking about?\u00a0 Alice.\u00a0 Right?\nPARTICIPANT:\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We had a woman \u2014 Alice Johnson.\u00a0 We had a woman, Alice Johnson, who was this lovely woman, and she was in for about 22 years already.\u00a0 I mean, she\u2019s served 22 years, and I think she had another 25 or 26 to go for making a phone call.\u00a0 And, look, she admits she did wrong.\u00a0 But, today, it would be a slightly different \u2014 like, maybe not enough, to be honest with you.\u00a0 But it would be very different.\nSo she was in and she was a wonderful woman, and Kanye West came and Kim came, and they said, \u201cPresident, could you do this?\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cDo what?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 \u201cDo what?\u00a0 What are you talking?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cA woman has been in jail for 22 years.\u00a0 She\u2019s got another 28 to serve, I think.\u00a0 Something like that.\u201d\u00a0 Think of that.\u00a0 And she\u2019s got another 28 to serve and she\u2019s a great woman and she\u2019s a wonderful woman.\nAnd I \u2014 I get along with Kanye for a long time.\u00a0 You saw the way he \u2014 when he was with the White House;

So it\u2019s great.\u00a0 It\u2019s great.\u00a0 It\u2019s been a great thing.\nBut I did want to say \u2014 so Van Jones was on about two weeks ago and he came to me and \u2014 I\u2019m telling you, he was so nice.\u00a0 He was sitting right there when I was doing it.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cThank you, Van Jones.\u00a0 Thank you.\u201d\u00a0 This one, this one, that one, that one.\u00a0 And that was it.\u00a0 And he came up to me, thanked me.\u00a0 And that was it.\nThen, about three weeks ago, I saw him on television.\u00a0 I don\u2019t watch his show too much, neither do too many.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But I\u2019m watching him and he gets up and he goes, \u201cI want to thank a number of people, because we did something this year that was undoable.\u00a0 They said it couldn\u2019t be done.\u00a0 We passed criminal justice reform.\u201d\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Van Jones said it.\u00a0 \u201cAnd I want to thank Reverend Al Sharpton.\u201d\u00a0 Well, he wasn\u2019t nowhere.\u00a0 He was nowhere to be found.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Booo \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Just so we know, I\u2019ve known him for a long time.\u00a0 He used to love me.\u00a0 We used to go to fights together with Don King.\u00a0 Don King is a friend of mine.\u00a0 Don King endorsed me.\u00a0 And Don Kin and Al Sharpton get along.\u00a0 We used to go to fights together, and he liked me until I ran and succeeded in politics.\u00a0 Then it wasn\u2019t to his benefit.\nBut, look, Al is a con man.\u00a0 We all know that.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Just a con man.\u00a0 He\u2019s a con man.\u00a0 And he scared NBC into giving him a show.\u00a0 You know, they don\u2019t want to have any trouble.\u00a0 But he\u2019s a \u2014 just a, sort of a third-rate con guy.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut here\u2019s Van Jones.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Here\u2019s Van Jones.\u00a0 Van Jones: \u201cI want to thank Al Sharpton.\u00a0 I want to thank all of these people.\u201d\u00a0 He\u2019s naming people I never heard of.\u00a0 The only one he didn\u2019t mention was me.\nAnd then it got worse.\u00a0 You ready?\u00a0 Candace, listen to this.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Terrence, are you listening? (Laughter.)\nSo he named these people \u2014 a lot of people \u2014 standing at the end of a show.\u00a0 \u201cI want to thank \u2014 because this was the greatest year we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 We got criminal justice reform.\u00a0 I want to thank this one and that one and that one and that one.\u201d\u00a0 I never heard of any of them.\u00a0 And I kept waiting for my name.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nI said, \u201cDarling, come over here.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to have a great, really, little name mention.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 \u201cYes, darling.\u201d\u00a0 The First Lady \u2014 how good is the First Lady?\u00a0 So she came over.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And I kept waiting, and I kept waiting, and then he named a lot of people.\u00a0 That was the end.\u00a0 I said \u2014 I was a little embarrassed in front of my wife.\u00a0 I said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t name me.\u00a0 I\u2019m the one that did it.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nI called up Jared.\u00a0 Right, Jared?\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d\u00a0 But before that \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 he did have one other thing to say.\u00a0 This was three weeks ago.\u00a0 He said, \u201cAnd I have one thing to say that we have to do.\u00a0 We must defeat this President.\u201d\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Booo \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u201cWe have to defeat President Trump.\u00a0 And we have to work 24 hours a day to defeat President Donald Trump.\u201d\nAnd I called Jared, and I said, \u201cThat\u2019s terrible.\u201d\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 Is that a true story?\u00a0 And then he spoke to Jared and he apologized, didn\u2019t he?\u00a0 He apologized.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t accept those apologies, you know?\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 Should we get back onto script, okay?\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 No!\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0 They say, \u201cNo.\u201d\u00a0 This is more inter- \u2014 they don\u2019t want to go back onto \u2014 this is much more interesting.\u00a0 We love you folks, okay?\u00a0 We love you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nVan Jones.\u00a0 Van Jones, he\u2019s another beauty.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Van, for the wonderful acknowledgment.\u00a0 I appreciate it.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nTo give every American child the best chance to reach the American Dream, we are fighting for school choice.\u00a0 Very important.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSadly, Democrat lawmakers care more about catering to lobbyists and powerful teachers\u2019 unions than they do about improving our schools for our children.\u00a0 And Democrats care more about illegal immigrants than about their own African American constituents.\u00a0 It\u2019s true.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 They want to give healthcare to people that just walked into the country.\u00a0 And for you, they don\u2019t care.\u00a0 The whole thing is crazy.\u00a0 These people have gone absolutely nuts.\nWhile we\u2019re fighting for the American way of life, the hard left and the radical left is working to trample the rule of law, erode individual liberty, and exert a far-reaching control over our lives.\u00a0 Left-wing censors have launched an all-out campaign against free speech.\u00a0 That is why they are trying to silence, de-platform, cancel, punish all of the proud conservative voters, all of the proud African American voices that know what\u2019s happening and know how to become big, big, successful people, help other people.\u00a0 They want to silence you.\nBut we know the patriots in this room will never be intimidated.\u00a0 I know that.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I know that.\nSo here, with us today, is Kearyn Bolin, President of the Texas State University \u2014 that\u2019s a big deal \u2014 Turning Point USA Chapter, who has bravely defended the right to free speech.\u00a0 And, Kearyn, would you please come up and say a few words?\u00a0 Please.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I thought so.\u00a0 I love her hair.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 You look great.\u00a0 That\u2019s beautiful.\nMS. BOLIN:\u00a0 So, last year at my college campus, they did try to ban Turning Point from our campus.\u00a0 So we fought strong and we prevailed.\u00a0 The piece of legislation was completely unconstitutional, and we are still fighting strong on our campus.\u00a0 So we\u2019re still there.\nI just want to thank Donald Trump for everything you have done for us.\u00a0 We are so incredibly honored to be here.\u00a0 And you\u2019ve done so much for this country, and thank you so much.\nI\u2019d also like to thank Turning Point for giving me the platform and the confidence to fight for a right for freedom of speech.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIt hasn\u2019t been easy and it will not be easy, but being a part of Turning Point and being able to see all of you accomplish so many of your goals and to help fight for the freedom of speech, it\u2019s honestly amazing and it gives me so much hope.\nOur generation is playing a vital role in keeping our First Amendment rights, and we are going to continue to keep up that fight.\nSo all of you on your campuses or in high school \u2014 I know a lot of you are in high school \u2014 continue to fight for your right for freedom of speech because you know where you stand, and everyone else can know where you stand too.\u00a0 So just keep up that fight.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Kearyn.\n(Gives kiss on the cheek.)\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Aww!\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Kearyn.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I got to get the other cheek.\n(Gives kiss on the cheek.)\u00a0 Now I feel better.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYou\u2019ve done a fantastic job.\u00a0 I appreciate it.\nIn order to protect the rights of our students, I signed an executive order making clear that public colleges and universities shutting down free speech will risk losing all of the billions and billions of dollars that we give them.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo we\u2019ll shut down their federal taxpayer dollars that go to them.\u00a0 And then they shut down speech.\u00a0 And they just choose whoever it is.\u00a0 They\u2019ll let somebody speak, they\u2019ll tell other people you can\u2019t speak, and then we\u2019re supposed to give them, individually, hundreds of millions of dollars.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t work that way anymore.\nI\u2019ve also tasked my administration to explore every possible solution to stop social media giants from restricting your rights to speak your mind.\u00a0 And, Candace, you had a problem with that, I know.\u00a0 And other people have had a problem.\u00a0 Some people in this room have had a problem.\u00a0 Terrence, have you had a problem with it?\u00a0 Huh?\u00a0 Terrence has had a problem.\u00a0 It\u2019s incredible.\u00a0 It\u2019s incredible.\u00a0 Yeah, no,\u00a0a lot of people have.\u00a0 But not the other side of the world.\u00a0 The other side doesn\u2019t have that problem.\u00a0 Very rarely do they have it.\nWe must preserve the fundamental American rights that generations of Americans have sacrificed everything to secure.\nWith us this afternoon is Ben Okereke.\u00a0 That\u2019s a great name.\u00a0 I love that name.\u00a0 When Ben was 14 years old, he legally immigrated to the United States after suffering many hardships in Cameroon, which I hear is a beautiful, beautiful place.\u00a0 Cameroon.\n(Audience member cheers.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Oh.\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 One person from Cameroon.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nTo give back to our country, he joined the United States Army and honorably served for four years \u2014 (applause) \u2014 as a very talented field artillery specialist.\u00a0 A lot of talent, they say.\nBen, we salute your noble service.\u00a0 And please say a few words.\u00a0 Ben.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Please.\u00a0 All yours.\nMR.

        "text": "South Lawn\n10:43 A.M. EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So, the unemployment numbers just came out, and they\u2019re the best numbers we\u2019ve had in over 50 years.\u00a0 The unemployment number is down to 3.5 percent.\u00a0 So that goes way, way back.\u00a0 We haven\u2019t had numbers like this in a long time.\u00a0 Wages are up by almost 3 percent.\u00a0 That\u2019s a fantastic increase for everybody out there working.\u00a0 We\u2019re very happy about those numbers.\u00a0 The stock market is substantially up, as it was yesterday.\u00a0 And our country does well.\u00a0 Europe is not doing well.\u00a0 Asia is doing poorly, to put it mildly.\u00a0 And we continue to do very well; we\u2019re the miracle.\nBut the unemployment numbers just came out: 3.5 percent unemployment.\u00a0 And that is a tremendous number; the lowest in over 50 years.\u00a0 So, very happy.\nAnd, I think, really, very important \u2014 again, I\u2019ll say: Wages are up.\u00a0 When I was running, wages were nowhere.\u00a0 They were going down.\u00a0 And people were having two and three jobs, and they were making less money than they made 20 years before.\u00a0 Now wages are up.\u00a0 So we\u2019re very happy about that.\nOne other thing, having to do with Poland.\u00a0 So, Poland is a country; great people.\u00a0 We have a lot of Polish Americans living in the United States.\u00a0 I\u2019ve just signed \u2014 I will soon be signing \u2014 and sign certain preliminary applications.\u00a0 We will be giving a full visa waiver to Poland.\u00a0 That means that people from Poland can easily travel there, and people from here can easily go back and forth.\u00a0 They can each \u2014 people from the U.S., people from Poland, can very easily go back and forth between the United States and Poland.\nSo, they\u2019ve been trying to get this for many, many decades.\u00a0 And I got it for the Polish people, in honor of the Polish people in the United States and in Poland.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re very happy with that.\nYeah.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did you see Adam Schiff got four Pinocchios by the Post, this morning, for lying?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I heard Adam Schiff got four Pinocchios.\u00a0 That\u2019s good.\u00a0 He should have gotten them two and a half years ago.\nThat\u2019s a very nice question.\u00a0 Let me shake your hand.\u00a0 Come here.\u00a0 That\u2019s a very nice question.\u00a0 That\u2019s almost a surprise.\u00a0 I figured that was a trick question, right?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Also, what does your letter to Pelosi say?\u00a0 And when will you send it?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019ll be issuing a letter.\u00a0 As everybody knows, we\u2019ve been treated very unfairly, very different from anybody else.\u00a0 If you go over not only history \u2014 I mean, if you go over any aspect of life, you\u2019ll see how unfairly we\u2019ve been treated.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done a fantastic job.\nEverything, to me, is about corruption.\u00a0 We want to find out what happened with 2016.\u00a0 And, as you know, there\u2019s a lot of work going on, on that.\u00a0 I don\u2019t care about Biden\u2019s campaign, but I do care about corruption.\u00a0 His campaign \u2014 that\u2019s up to him.\u00a0 Politics \u2014 that\u2019s up to them.\u00a0 I don\u2019t care about politics.\u00a0 Politics, as I think I\u2019ve made clear \u2014 and yesterday, somebody asked me a question, and I gave an\u00a0answer \u2014 but always in the form of corruption.\nWhat I want to do \u2014 and I think I have an obligation to do it, probably a duty to do it: corruption \u2014 we are looking for corruption.\u00a0 When you look at what Biden and his son did, and when you look at other people \u2014 what they\u2019ve done.\u00a0 And I believe there was tremendous corruption with Biden, but I think there was beyond \u2014 I mean, beyond corruption \u2014 having to do with the 2016 campaign, and what these lowlifes did to so many people, to hurt so many people in the Trump campaign \u2014 which was successful, despite all of the fighting us.\u00a0 I mean, despite all of the unfairness.\nSo, we are looking at corruption.\u00a0 We\u2019re not looking at politics.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking at corruption.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, what did you say to the Chinese about the Bidens, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 Somebody said that a long time ago.\u00a0 Was that in 2017?\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 You\u2019d have to tell me when.\u00a0 All I can tell you is this: When I speak to foreign leaders, I speak in an appropriate way.\u00a0 If you notice, they don\u2019t mention the call that I had with the President of Ukraine.\u00a0 They don\u2019t mention that because it was so good.\nThe only time they mentioned it was when Adam Schiff made it up.\u00a0 You talk about Pinocchios \u2014 that should get 10 Pinocchios.\u00a0 He made up \u2014 he made up a story.\u00a0 It was a phony story.\u00a0 Adam Schiff.\u00a0 So, they don\u2019t talk about that anymore.\nYou know, when this came out, it was \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d\u00a0 Well, there was none.\u00a0 Also, yesterday, the Ambassador \u2014 who I heard was tremendous and a tremendous person \u2014 he was 100 percent for what we\u2019re saying.\u00a0 A hundred percent.\u00a0 And, if you look, he also said there was no quid pro quo.\u00a0 That\u2019s the whole ballgame.\nBut now the Democrats don\u2019t bring that up anymore because they lost.\u00a0 Look, they never thought I was going to release the phone call between the Ukrainian President and myself.\u00a0 When I released that call, they were \u2014 they were jumping around like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t know how to respond.\u00a0 And then they found out \u2014 and then they found out that the call itself was so bad for them.\u00a0 It was a perfect call.\u00a0 There was nothing \u2014 we hand that call out.\u00a0 We\u2019ve handed the call out to people, and they\u2019d say, \u201cWow, this is incredible.\u201d\u00a0 We\u2019re very proud of that call.\u00a0 When I speak to a foreign leader, I speak in an appropriate manner.\nNow, we\u2019re also doing trade deals with China and we\u2019re doing deals with a lot of people for the country, so I\u2019m not looking to insult people.\u00a0 I can tell you that.\u00a0 But we can probably find that out.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Would you be more willing to do a trade deal with the Chinese if they investigate Biden?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, it has nothing to do with it.\u00a0 No.\u00a0 No. I want to do a trade deal with China, but only if it\u2019s good for our country.\u00a0 And it could happen.\u00a0 Because you know they\u2019re very much \u2014 they\u2019re very much coming over next week, as I understand it.\u00a0 So I\u2019d like to do a great deal with China, but only if it\u2019s a great trade deal for this country.\u00a0 One thing has nothing to do with the other.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you want the House to proceed with an impeachment inquiry at this point?\u00a0 An official impeachment inquiry.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I wouldn\u2019t mind because we have no rights.\u00a0 They way they\u2019re doing it, they\u2019ve taken away our rights.\u00a0 So, if they proceed \u2014 and, you know, they\u2019ll just get their people.\u00a0 They\u2019re all in line.\u00a0 Because even though many of them don\u2019t want to vote, they have no choice.\u00a0 They have to follow their leadership.\u00a0 And then we\u2019ll get it to the Senate, and we\u2019re going to win.\nThe Republicans have been very unified.\u00a0 This is the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country. \u00a0So we beat the one that started immediately.\u00a0 We went through two years of Mueller, and that came out like a 10.\u00a0 It came out perfect.\u00a0 And a few days go by and they start this nonsense.\u00a0 And this is just as ridiculous.\nSo the Democrats, unfortunately, they have the votes.\u00a0 They can vote very easily, even though most of them, many of them, don\u2019t believe they should do it.\u00a0 And I do believe \u2014 I do believe that because of what they\u2019re doing with Pelosi and their real leaders, AOC plus 3 \u2014 that\u2019s their real leaders \u2014 I really believe that they\u2019re going to pay a tremendous price at the polls.\nAnd we saw the first glimpse of it two weeks ago, in a great state, North Carolina.\u00a0 We saw a great, great glimpse of what\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0 Because, in North Carolina, we had two races.\u00a0 One gentleman, Dan Bishop, was down by 17 points with three weeks to go, and he won easily.\u00a0 And the other man, as you know, Greg Murphy, was up by a very little bit and he won by a massive amount \u2014 I don\u2019t know, someplace in the twenties.\u00a0 Twenty percent or something.\u00a0 Maybe higher.\nSo I think you got your first glimpse of what\u2019s going to happen.\u00a0 And the big key is that I have to campaign there.\u00a0 But if you look at what happened in North Carolina \u2014 two races \u2014 we won both of them, and we won them easily.\u00a0 And one was almost tied and the other one was a big, big lead, and that one turned and the tie became a landslide.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, did Mitch McConnell make you any promises about a vote on impeachment in the Senate?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I don\u2019t know about Mitch.\u00a0 I have a lot of respect for Mitch McConnell.\u00a0 I know that; I saw his statements.\u00a0 And he thinks that this is ridiculous.\u00a0 He thinks it\u2019s unfair.\u00a0 I saw his statement yesterday that he put out where he read my phone conversation and he thought it was a wonderful conversation.\u00a0 And it was.\nBut, see, the Democrats don\u2019t talk about that anymore.\u00a0 They try and go to other things.\u00a0 These people are looking for anything they can get because they know they\u2019re going to lose the election.\u00a0 And we\u2019re in election season now.\u00a0 For them to be doing this now, it\u2019s never been done.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The U.S. is speaking to North Korea in Sweden.\u00a0 What do you expect?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 What?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The U.S. is speaking to North Korea in Sweden right now.\u00a0 What do you expect?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So we\u2019re dealing with North Korea.\u00a0 They want to meet, and we\u2019ll be meeting with them.\u00a0 It\u2019s probably being set up as we speak, but we\u2019ll let you know.\u00a0 But North Korea would like to do something.\u00a0 Iran would like to do something.\u00a0 We have a lot of countries in a very good position right now, despite the witch hunt, which hurts our country and it hurts America.\u00a0 But Iran wants to do something.\u00a0 North Korea wants to do something.\u00a0 And China would like to do something.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is the Justice Department investigating Joe Biden?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I don\u2019t know that.\u00a0 That, you\u2019d have to ask.\u00a0 Is the Justice Department investigating Joe Biden?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, that, you\u2019d have you to ask Attorney General Barr.\u00a0 But I can tell you, just as an observer, what I saw Biden do with his son \u2014 he is pillaging these countries, and he\u2019s hurting us.\u00a0 How would you like to have, as an example, Joe Biden negotiating the China deal if he took it over from me after the election?\u00a0 He would give them \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Wait.\u00a0 He would give them everything.\u00a0 He would give them everything.\u00a0 How would you like to have that?\u00a0 Joe Biden would just roll out the red carpet.\u00a0 He would give them everything.\nSo, again, this doesn\u2019t pertain to anything but corruption.\u00a0 And that has to do with me.\u00a0 I don\u2019t care about politics.\u00a0 I don\u2019t care about anything.\u00a0 But I do care about corruption.\u00a0 And to have somebody take out a billion and a half dollars out of China, who\u2019s totally unfit.\u00a0 He\u2019s unfit.\u00a0 To have him get a billion and a half dollars, to have him \u2014 and now I\u2019m hearing the number of $50,000 a month.\u00a0 Now I\u2019m hearing the number of $50,000 a month is very low.\u00a0 It\u2019s a much higher number that Biden\u2019s son was getting per month.\u00a0 The fact is it\u2019s much higher.\u00a0 And for him to \u2014 and for him, as a total \u2014 for him, as a totally unqualified person, to be getting hundreds of thousands a month is very, very (inaudible).\nSo, again, is the Justice Department investigating that?\u00a0 I just don\u2019t know.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, do you think the Democrats have the votes?\u00a0 Do you think the Democrats have the votes to impeach you?\u00a0 Do you think you will be impeached?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I think they follow the leader.\u00a0 One thing with the Democrats \u2014 I give them credit for it \u2014 a lot of them don\u2019t want it; you know that, you interview them.\u00a0 A lot of them are in there \u2014 they call them \u201cTrump districts\u201d \u2014 where I won and then they won after when I wasn\u2019t running.\u00a0 But I\u2019m going to win them big.\nIf you look at what\u2019s happened with my polls, they\u2019re through the roof.\u00a0 You know why?\u00a0 Because of this phony witch hunt.\u00a0 If you look at what happened with the fundraising, we\u2019ve set a record \u2014 the Republicans \u2014 because people are sick and tired of it.\nI got a call the other night from pastors \u2014 the biggest pastors, evangelical Christians.\u00a0 They said, \u201cWe have never seen our religious or any religious so electrified.\u201d\u00a0 They are \u2014 they say they\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u00a0 Churches are joining.\u00a0 Hundreds of thousands of people.\u00a0 And, you know, that\u2019s to a large extent because of you and your partner, the Democrats.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But do you think it will pass the House, sir?\u00a0 Do you think it will pass the House and die in the Senate?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I think this.\u00a0 I think this: We have great \u2014 we have a great relationship in the Senate.\u00a0 I have a 95 percent approval rating in the Republican Party.\u00a0 I believe the Senate \u2014 and I haven\u2019t spoken to that many senators \u2014 but I believe the senators look at this as a hoax.\u00a0 It\u2019s a witch hunt.\u00a0 It\u2019s a disgrace.\u00a0 Should have never happened.\u00a0 Just like Russia collusion delusion should have never happened.\u00a0 That was a witch hunt.\u00a0 And just like that, should have never happened.\nSo I think in the Senate, I think they feel that the Republican Party has been treated very, very badly.\u00a0 Now, in the House, they have the majority.\u00a0 They all vote with AOC and plus three.\u00a0 Nancy Pelosi is petrified of them.\u00a0 I mean, she\u2019s afraid she\u2019s going to lose her position.\u00a0 Nancy Pelosi will lose her speakership right after the election when the Republicans take over the House.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, can we talk about the text messages that included holding off a visit to the White House?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 The one text message that I saw was just about the last text message.\u00a0 Because I don\u2019t know \u2014 I don\u2019t even know most of these ambassadors.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t even know their names.\u00a0 But the text message \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But what it included, sir, was a visit to the White House.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 the text message that I saw from Ambassador Sondland \u2014 who\u2019s highly respected \u2014 was: There\u2019s \u201cno quid pro quo.\u201d\u00a0 He said that.\u00a0 He said, by the way \u2014 it almost sounded like in general \u2014 he said, by the way, there\u2019s \u201cno quid pro quo.\u201d\u00a0 And there isn\u2019t.\nNow, for Biden there would be.\u00a0 But listen to this: There is no pro quo.\u00a0 And that was the text message that I saw.\u00a0 And that nullified everything.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have you asked foreign leaders for any corruption investigations that don\u2019t involve your political opponents?\u00a0 That is, are there other cases where you\u2019ve asked for corruption investigations?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You know, we would have to look.\u00a0 But I tell you, what I asked for and what I always will ask for is anything having to do with corruption with respect to our country.\u00a0 If a foreign country can help us with respect to corruption and corruption probes, and that \u2014 I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s Biden or anybody else.\u00a0 But if they can help us \u2014 if Biden is corrupt, if his son is corrupt.\u00a0 When his son takes out billions of dollars \u2014 billions \u2014 and he has no experience; he just got fired from the Navy \u2014 when they do that, that\u2019s no good.\nSo the only \u2014 just to finish your question \u2014 anything having to do with corruption, I actually feel I have an obligation to do that.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Including with Mr. Putin, sir?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is someone advising you that it is okay to solicit the help of other governments to investigate a potential political opponent?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, I don\u2019t say anything is okay.\u00a0 I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s okay.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is someone advising you that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Here\u2019s what\u2019s okay: If we feel there\u2019s corruption, like I feel there was in the 2016 campaign \u2014 there was tremendous corruption against me \u2014 if we feel there\u2019s corruption, we have a right to go to a foreign country.\nAnd just so you know \u2014 just so you know, I was investigated.\u00a0 I was investigated.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 Me.\u00a0 Me.\u00a0 In my campaign \u2014 I ran, I won.\u00a0 I was invest- \u2014 you won\u2019t say that, will you?\u00a0 I was investigated.\u00a0 I was investigated.\u00a0 And they think it could have been by UK.\u00a0 They think it could have been by Australia.\u00a0 They think it could have been by Italy.\u00a0 So when you get down to it, I was investigated by the Obama administration.\u00a0 By the Obama administration I was investigated.\u00a0 So when these people talk \u2014\nBut as far as I\u2019m concerned, what I want to look at and what we want to investigate: anything having to do with corruption.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In your view, Mr. President, do you view China as an ally, a partner, or an adversary?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I view China as somebody we\u2019re trying to make a deal with; we have a very good chance of making a deal with.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had good moments with China.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had bad moments with China.\u00a0 Right now, we\u2019re in a very important stage in terms of possibly making a deal.\u00a0 If we make it, it will be the biggest trade deal ever made \u2014 if we make it.\nBut I view China as somebody that we deal with on the world stage.\u00a0 I would like to get along with China if we can.\u00a0 And if we can, that\u2019s great.\u00a0 If we can\u2019t, that\u2019s okay, too.\nBut what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re negotiating a very tough deal.\u00a0 If the deal is not going to be 100 percent for us, then we\u2019re not going to make it.\nAnd I will \u2014 and I will say this.\u00a0 I will say this.\u00a0 I will say this: China very much wants to make this deal.\u00a0 China is getting killed.\u00a0 The tariffs are killing China.\u00a0 What\u2019s happened is they have now 3 million loss of jobs, their chains are broken up.\u00a0 If you look at their supply chain, which is a disaster \u2014 companies are going to other countries, including us.\u00a0 China, right now, is a total disaster.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, does a trade with China have anything to do with an investigation into Joe Biden?\u00a0 And will you ask Xi to investigate?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, no, no.\u00a0 Let me tell you: I\u2019m only interested in corruption.\u00a0 I don\u2019t care about politics.\u00a0 I don\u2019t care about Biden\u2019s politics.\u00a0 I never thought Biden was going to win, to be honest.\u00a0 I picked somebody else a long time ago.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll see what happens.\nBut I never thought Biden was going to win.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t care.\u00a0 I mean, frankly, if he won, I\u2019d be very happy.\u00a0 I think he\u2019d be an easy opponent.\u00a0 But I never thought Biden was going to win.\u00a0 I don\u2019t care about politics, but I do care about corruption.\u00a0 And this whole thing is about corruption.\u00a0 This whole thing \u2014 this whole thing is about corruption.\nThis is about corruption, and this is not about politics.\u00a0 This is about corruption.\u00a0 And if you look and you read our Constitution and many other things, we \u2014 I have an obligation to look at corruption.\u00a0 I have an actual obligation and a duty.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you going to comply with the House subpoenas?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 What?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are you going to cooperate with the House in this investigation?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 That\u2019s up to the lawyers.\u00a0 I know the lawyers think they\u2019ve never seen anything so unfair.\u00a0 They\u2019ve never seen anything so unjust.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been President now for almost three years, and I\u2019ve been going through this for almost three years.\u00a0 It\u2019s almost become, like, a part of my day.\nBut in the meantime, we have the best economy we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 We have the best job numbers we\u2019ve had in 51 years.\u00a0 The best unemployment numbers that we\u2019ve had in a half a century.\u00a0 The best numbers that we\u2019ve ever had \u2014 African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, women \u2014 everything.\u00a0 We have the best numbers that we\u2019ve had in many, many, many decades.\nAnd you know what?\u00a0 People understand that.\u00a0 People are working.\u00a0 They\u2019re making money.\u00a0 The \u2014 if you look at one very important number that was just announced: wages up 3 percent.\u00a0 That\u2019s unheard of.\u00a0 That\u2019s unheard of.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s a great thing.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What about other Democrats?\u00a0 What about other Democrats?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I didn\u2019t hear you.\u00a0 Go.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, when did you first get the idea to investigate the Bidens\u2019 activity in Ukraine?\u00a0 Who advised you to look into that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We\u2019re investigating corruption.\u00a0 We\u2019re not investigating campaigns.\u00a0 I don\u2019t care about his campaign.\u00a0 As I said, I didn\u2019t think \u2014 I didn\u2019t think and I don\u2019t think Biden is going to win.\u00a0 All right?\u00a0 I don\u2019t think.\nAnd maybe to answer your question, when you say, \u201cWho is going to win?\u201d\u00a0\u2014 I\u2019d rather not make a prediction, but I do have a feeling about it.\nI didn\u2019t think \u2014 because I\u2019ve watched Biden over the years, and Biden is not the brightest person.\u00a0 I never thought he was going to win.\u00a0 I never felt he was going to win.\u00a0 If you look at his other two campaigns, he was a one-percenter.\u00a0 He got very few votes.\u00a0 He got taken off of the garbage heap by Obama.\u00a0 Obama took him off the garbage heap.\u00a0 So it\u2019s one of those things.\nBut I never thought that Biden \u2014 I didn\u2019t think Biden was going to win.\u00a0 I guess that everybody has a shot.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t think he would be, frankly, my toughest opponent.\nAnd just to finish off \u2014 just to finish off, I don\u2019t think that he will win.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t think he was going to win, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to win.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Joe Biden\u2019s poll numbers are dropping pretty badly.\u00a0 Elizabeth Warren\u2019s are rising.\u00a0 Bernie is sick.\u00a0 What do you think about facing Elizabeth Warren?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s fine.\u00a0 I mean, it\u2019s fine.\u00a0 She\u2019s a socialist and maybe worse than that.\u00a0 But we\u2019ll see.\nI heard \u2014 I haven\u2019t seen his poll numbers.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t seen Biden\u2019s poll numbers.\u00a0 Look, Joe Biden was never going to make it.\u00a0 All right?\u00a0 He was never going to make it.\u00a0 He tried it twice.\u00a0 He\u2019s at 1 percent.\u00a0 There\u2019s a reason.\nWhen I announced, I went to number one, day one, and I stayed there the entire primary season.\u00a0 I never was off center-stage.\u00a0 I was never given credit for that, but that\u2019s okay.\u00a0 Except by Steve.\u00a0 The only one that gave me credit was Steve.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did you try to talk to Rouhani at the UN?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Who?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did you try to talk to Iran\u2019s President?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, they were trying to set up a meeting but he wanted sanctions lifted.\u00a0 And I said, \u201cYou must be kidding.\u201d\u00a0 We had no interest.\u00a0 Rouhani wanted a meeting at the UN.\u00a0 We did talk.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t speak to him personally, but our sides talked.\u00a0 He wanted sanctions lifted or partially lifted, and I said no.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Inaudible) socialism in Venezuela for political campaign.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We\u2019re watching Venezuela very, very closely.\u00a0 The people are suffering, and we are watching it very closely.\u00a0 We\u2019re also giving big aid to Venezuela.\nNow, one thing.\u00a0 I\u2019m now going to Walter Reed Hospital.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be giving out five Purple Hearts to unbelievably brave young people.\nAnd I\u2019m going to meet you \u2014 some of you are going over.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\u00a0 I think some of you are going over.\u00a0 So we could talk further over there.\u00a0 Although, when we\u2019re there, I would like you to respect the process.\u00a0 We\u2019re giving out Purple Hearts to very brave people, wounded warriors, people that have been \u2014 I mean, they\u2019re just incredible people.\u00a0 And I\u2019m going to be back here in probably two hours.\nThank you.\u00a0 Good job.\nEND\n11:06 A.M.

        "text": "Caterpillar, Inc.\nGreen Valley, Arizona\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, hello, Arizona!\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It is great to be here.\u00a0 What an inspiring place.\u00a0 How about a big round of applause for the guys in the big trucks behind me.\u00a0 What a tremendous \u2014 what a great job.\nTo Governor Doug Ducey, to Senator Martha McSally, to Jim Umpleby \u2014\nPARTICIPANT:\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 who is a fellow Hoosier who actually went to college at a rival college \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 across the Hoosier State.\u00a0 And most especially to the men and women of this great company.\u00a0 Caterpillar is a legendary American company and its best days are ahead here in the Grand Canyon State and all across America.\u00a0 Thanks for what you do.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 What a great team.\nAnd before I get started, let me also say what an honor it is to be here today with a man you just heard from, a man I just mentioned, and, frankly, someone who I hope you know is simply one of the best governors in the United States of America.\u00a0 I can honestly say I was for Doug Ducey before it was cool.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nWould you join me?\u00a0 Why don\u2019t you all get on your feet and thank Governor Doug Ducey for all that he\u2019s done for Arizona, for jobs and schools, and for quality of life?\u00a0 Thank you, Governor.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 What a great guy.\nIt\u2019s also a privilege to be here today with a great American leader \u2014 a woman who has dedicated her life to making this country better and more prosperous.\u00a0 And now she serves in this administration as the Treasurer of the United States of America.\u00a0 Jovita Carranza, thank you for your service to America and your stalwart support of the USMCA.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd finally, I know I\u2019m going to say a little bit more about her in a little bit, but I have to tell you: My son is actually a fighter pilot in the Marine Corps.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 And so I\u2019m a little partial to fighter pilots.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I\u2019ll tell you what \u2014 if you haven\u2019t figured it out yet, Arizona \u2014 she served in the House of Representatives for you, and now she\u2019s emerged already as one of the great leaders in the United States Senate.\u00a0 Arizona has a fighter in Senator Martha McSally, and we are so grateful for your strong leadership on this issue.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Martha.\nAnd finally, let me bring greetings from a friend of mine who loves that state of Arizona \u2014 always be grateful for the support the people of Arizona have afforded us in that election in 2016.\u00a0 He is a great champion of American manufacturing.\u00a0 And he\u2019s been working hard to bring manufacturing back since the day we took office.\u00a0 I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd I\u2019m here on this breezy and cool day in Arizona \u2014 (laughter)\u00a0\u2014 here in \u201cfootball weather\u201d \u2014 is that right? \u2014 just to speak to you on the President\u2019s behalf, and really on behalf of the nation, to say we\u2019ve got an incredible opportunity before us, Arizona.\u00a0 As I stand before you today, Congress has on their desk the largest trade deal in American history.\u00a0 And I came here to Tucson, I came to Arizona to say the time has come for Congress to pass the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and pass it this year.\u00a0\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe\u2019re going to talk about trade today \u2014 which Caterpillar is a global company, isn\u2019t it?\u00a0 Selling your products literally all over the world.\u00a0 American excellence in high relief.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to talk about Arizona workers and Arizona businesses.\nBut before that, let me reflect on the progress we\u2019ve made because of the confidence the people of Arizona placed in this President and our administration two and a half years ago.\u00a0 I think there\u2019s only one way you can describe the last two and a half years: It\u2019s been two and a half years of action, two and a half years of results.\u00a0 It\u2019s been two and a half years of promises made and promises kept.\u00a0 But we\u2019re just getting started, Arizona.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we need the USMCA.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYou know, at a time when so many in Congress have spent the last two and a half years on endless investigations, trying to overturn the will of the American people in that last election, I\u2019m glad to report to you today, as you\u2019ve already heard from this podium, that there is bipartisan support for the USMCA.\u00a0 But we need Speaker Pelosi to put the USMCA on the floor of the House of Representatives, and do it this year.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThe good news is that, even just yesterday, Speaker Pelosi said that House Democrats were, in her words, on a path to \u201cyes.\u201d\u00a0 And we want them to keep going on that path.\u00a0 Let\u2019s get to \u201cyes\u201d on the USMCA and score a victory for jobs in Arizona and America.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI mean, I think you all know the American people don\u2019t want more partisanship; we want more jobs.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 We don\u2019t want more resistance; we want more results.\u00a0 The American people want the USMCA to pass and to pass this year.\u00a0 And I literally have been traveling all over the country \u2014 all over the country, Jim \u2014 telling this story.\nAnd everywhere I go I hear the tremendous support for the USMCA.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll make you a promise: Whatever goes on in Washington, D.C., this President, this Vice President, your senator, your governor will not be deterred.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to keep fighting for jobs.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to get the USMCA on the floor of the Congress.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to fight until we get it done.\nYou know, we\u2019ve been fighting to keep the promises that President Trump made to the people of Arizona since day one.\u00a0 I mean, this President promised to rebuild our military, and I\u2019m proud to report that this President has already signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan.\u00a0 He also promised \u2014 (applause) \u2014 thank you.\nHe also promised to revive this economy.\u00a0 And we cut taxes for working families and businesses.\u00a0 We rolled back red tape.\u00a0 We\u2019ve unleashed American energy and unleashed an American energy revolution.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve negotiated free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first.\nAnd I don\u2019t need to tell you here in Arizona, which is a booming state, that the results have been remarkable.\u00a0 Since Election Day 2016, businesses large and small across this country have created 6.3 million new jobs, including 200,000 good-paying jobs right here in the Grand Canyon State.\u00a0 How about that?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 That\u2019s great, Governor.\nUnemployment has hit a 50-year low.\u00a0 And I\u2019m proud to report \u2014 as we just began Hispanic Heritage Month all across this country, and I met with great leaders in the Hispanic American community before we left Phoenix this morning \u2014 we now have the lowest unemployment ever recorded for Hispanic Americans and African Americans.\u00a0 The American Dream is working again for every American.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI mean, it is \u2014 it really is amazing.\u00a0 And you need look no farther, Jim, than manufacturing to find proof of what\u2019s happening in this economy.\u00a0 Today, there are more manufacturing job openings in America than any time in the last decade.\u00a0 In fact, there\u2019s more job openings in manufacturing and across this country today than there are people looking for work.\u00a0 And last year, we saw a record-high optimism among manufacturers and small businesses, and the most new manufacturing jobs created in more than 20 years.\u00a0 Now, that\u2019s real different from about three years ago.\nI remember the last President was talking about manufacturing jobs were gone for good.\u00a0 And I\u2019ve got to tell you: You know, I\u2019m proud of that Caterpillar operation back in Indiana \u2014 just as proud as you are here in Arizona, Governor.\u00a0 And you know, in Arizona, kind of like Indiana, we do two things well; you know, you make things and you grow things.\nAnd we had a President in the last administration who said, \u201cWhat are you going to?\u00a0 Are you going to wave a magic wand to get those jobs back?\u201d\u00a0 They\u2019d actually lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs.\u00a0 Well, we didn\u2019t need a magic wand, we just needed President Donald Trump in the White House.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Five hundred thousand manufacturing jobs created all across America, including nineteen thousand jobs right here in Arizona.\nIt\u2019s not just been about more jobs.\u00a0 It\u2019s also been about better jobs.\u00a0 I mean, since our Election Day in 2016, I\u2019m proud to report the average American household has seen their income go up by more the $5,000 a year.\u00a0 Wages are rising at the fastest pace in a decade.\nAnd what\u2019s most exciting to the President and me \u2014 while we\u2019d like to see everybody\u2019s income rising, the truth is wages are rising most rapidly for blue-collar, hardworking Americans.\u00a0 The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s true.\nI mean, we\u2019re seeing success stories all across the country over the last two and a half years.\u00a0\u00a0And for more than 90 years, Caterpillar has been one of America\u2019s best companies.\u00a0 And, Jim, you and your team are keeping that proud tradition alive.\u00a0 I\u2019m told Caterpillar \u2014 your machines are sold on six continents.\u00a0 And the United States military is even using them on the seventh continent: Antarctica.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I hope they don\u2019t drive across any thin ice.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nCaterpillar\u2019s success story is a \u2014 is really a part of the success of this country.\u00a0 I mean, think about it:\u00a0 Caterpillar\u2019s machines were used by the Allies during World War Two.\u00a0 They worked on some of the most iconic projects in American history, like the Golden Gate Bridge, the Hoover Dam, and widening the Panama Canal.\u00a0 Caterpillar was there.\nIn an extraordinary legacy, you continue today with these new developments and innovations like we just saw with these trucks all behind us.\u00a0 It really was amazing.\u00a0 Jim had to point out to me which of the trucks had drivers and which ones didn\u2019t.\u00a0 And, Jim, I\u2019m actually just kind of glad you didn\u2019t make me stand down there as they were rolling around before you told me that.\u00a0 But they did an incredible job.\nAnd with this booming economy, I\u2019m also told Caterpillar sales have soared by 42 percent since 2016, and you created 3,000 jobs right here in the United States of America.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, Caterpillar.\nBut I think Jim would be the first one to say results like that just don\u2019t happen.\u00a0 Sure, they\u2019re a result of economic policies that allow companies like this one to keep more of what they earn and reinvest and be free of burdensome regulations.\u00a0 Sure, that \u2014 there\u2019s some credit that goes to opening up markets around the world to what you build here and what you make here.\nBut I know Jim would be the first to say it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s really about all of you.\u00a0 And all of you, each and every day, practice the integrity, the craftsmanship, the hard work, and the ingenuity that makes these incredible machines become a reality.\nI mean, the truth is, Caterpillar is prospering, Arizona and America are prospering because of people just like you.\u00a0 So give yourselves a round of applause.\u00a0 Great job.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd there\u2019s all kinds of individual stories.\u00a0 I\u2019m told there\u2019s another Marine here, who actually was a veteran of the Illinois National Guard.\u00a0 He served this nation as an anti-aircraft missile launcher technician and now he uses his technical skills gained in the uniform to help customers use Cat\u2019s technology on mining projects all over the world.\u00a0 He\u2019s been with Caterpillar for 15 years.\nSo, for all he did in the uniform in the United States, and all he\u2019s done to make this company such a great success, would you join me in thanking Justin Sanchez \u2014 Justin Sanchez.\u00a0 Where are you, Sarge?\u00a0 Stand up.\u00a0 There you are.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you, Sergeant.\nI\u2019m told there\u2019s another veteran of the Air Force.\u00a0 Martha, you\u2019ll be glad to know \u2014 another veteran the Air Force.\u00a0 Also, the Washington Air National Guard, specialized in avionic electronics and repairing preparing radars on A-10s \u2014\nPARTICIPANT:\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Very good \u2014 C-130s, K-135s.\nAnd now she tells the story of Caterpillar\u2019s Surface Mining technology to employees around the world.\u00a0 So would you join me in thanking her for her service in uniform and her service here?\u00a0 Where\u2019s Amy Madsen?\u00a0 Staff Sergeant Amy Madsen, take a bow.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Great job.\u00a0 Amy\u2019s got a fan club.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 That\u2019s great.\nAnd, you know, I recognized the two of them because, frankly, they\u2019re emblematic of all of you.\u00a0 In fact, in that aspect of their background, they\u2019re like a whole lot of you gathered here today.\u00a0 I\u2019m told they\u2019re not the only ones at Caterpillar who\u2019ve worn the uniform of the United States.\nSo, how about if you\u2019re a veteran, if you\u2019re able to stand \u2014 if you wore the uniform of the United States, would you just mind standing up, letting us show how much we appreciate all you\u2019ve done for our country. Let\u2019s thank our veterans.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thanks for your service, all.\nAnd thank you all.\u00a0 Congratulations.\u00a0 I mean, the remarkable employees here today \u2014 like Justin and Amy, and like all of you \u2014 show that American workers can compete with anybody, anywhere in the world.\nAnd we\u2019re doing it now today, but the truth is, we can do it even better if we open more markets around the world to what we make, what we manufacture, and what we export from here.\u00a0 And the good news is the President\u2019s been working on opening up markets around the world since day one.\u00a0 We renegotiated a trade agreement with South Korea.\u00a0 We signed the first phase of a new bilateral trade agreement with Japan.\u00a0 And President Trump put China on notice that the era of economic surrender is over.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to defend American jobs and American workers.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut closer to home, it brings us to the USMCA.\u00a0 And I won\u2019t belabor the point; you all know my opinion on it, right?\u00a0 I mean, the truth is this is a historic agreement.\u00a0 And it\u2019s an agreement that \u2014 it\u2019s a win for every American.\u00a0 The truth is, according to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA, once it\u2019s signed into law, is going to add about $68 billion to our economy.\u00a0 And right out of the gate, we think it\u2019s going to create 176,000 American jobs, including nearly 50,000 manufacturing jobs.\u00a0 And that\u2019s a conservative estimate.\nAnd we\u2019re not just creating more jobs, but better jobs.\u00a0 The ITC also says that when this trade agreement is passed, American manufacturing workers are going to get another raise, in addition to the wages that are rising already.\u00a0 American manufacturing is working today.\u00a0 American manufacturing is going to win even more when we pass the USMCA.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo I want to encourage each and every one of you.\u00a0 I want to encourage each and every one of you to let your voice be heard.\u00a0 You know, I served in the Congress of the United States for 12 years before I became Governor of the state of Indiana, and I know that the most powerful voice \u2014 the most powerful force, rather \u2014 in Washington, D.C., is not one party or another, not some special interest or another, it\u2019s not even the media.\u00a0 The most powerful force in Washington, D.C., is the voice of the American people.\u00a0 So, Arizona, let your voice be heard.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThis is a time for you to pick up the phone, send an e-mail, tweet, reach out to those who represent Arizona in our nation\u2019s capital.\u00a0 But I could save you \u2014 I can save you some money.\u00a0 First and foremost, you don\u2019t need to call Senator Kyrsten Sinema, because she\u2019s been out there standing for the USMCA early on.\u00a0 And you sure don\u2019t need to call Senator Martha McSally.\u00a0 She is leading the charge in the United States Senate for the USMCA.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut I have to tell you, it\u2019s time \u2014 it\u2019s time to reach out.\u00a0 It\u2019s time to reach out to the rest of the delegation.\u00a0 Martha was talking about the folks that represent you in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 And it\u2019s time for you to reach out and make a respectful phone call, and tell people,\u00a0 You know, I was standing on a hillside outside Tucso- \u2014 Tucson and ran into Mike Pence\u201d \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 \u201cand a whole bunch of big trucks.\u00a0 And he just told me that this USMCA would be a huge win, not just for the company that I work for, but really for Arizona, and for \u2014 and for everybody across this country.\u201d\u00a0 And just tell them that, you know, the time has come for Congress to set politics aside. The time has come for Congress to vote on the USMCA.\u00a0 Just call them up and tell them that.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd you can start right here in Tucson.\u00a0 You can start right here in Tucson.\u00a0 Give Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick a call.\u00a0 Tell her I told you to call.\u00a0 And tell her you need the USMCA.\u00a0 And tell her to go tell Speaker Pelosi that when the USMCA comes to the floor, she\u2019s going to cast a vote for Arizona and she\u2019s going to cast a vote for jobs.\nI mean, the truth of matter is that, if all of us will do all we can to send a clear message to our nation\u2019s capital, we\u2019re going to get this done.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to roll our sleeves up.\u00a0 Even in these divided times in Washington, D.C., we have an opportunity, men and women, to do something that will be good for every American.\u00a0 It\u2019ll be something every American, whatever their politics, can rally behind.\u00a0 So, let your voice be heard and we\u2019ll get the USMCA done.\u00a0 I promise you, Arizona.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo, thanks for coming out today.\u00a0 I appreciate it.\u00a0 I actually skipped through some of my speech because I figured you\u2019d appreciate it too.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut it really is an honor to be with you.\u00a0 I have to tell you, for a small town guy from southern Indiana to be here in Arizona and serving as your Vice President is the greatest honor of my life.\u00a0 So, can I just take this opportunity to say to the people of Arizona: Thank you for the opportunity of serving as your Vice President.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI\u2019m grateful on behalf of myself and my family and \u2014 I already told the governor, that son of mine is going to be moving to Arizona before too long.\u00a0 So \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 you\u2019re going to have a Pence not too far from here, and we\u2019re going to be proud.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be proud to fly in as quietly as we possibly can, Governor \u2014 to visit my son and wonderful daughter-in-law.\nBut I want to thank you for what you\u2019ve done here.\u00a0 This is an incredible company.\u00a0 Jim, congratulations again on all your incredible success.\u00a0 Governor, thank you for leading the state with such energy and conviction and such good-natured winsomeness that you have that\u2019s all about you.\u00a0 Thank you, Senator McSally for your \u2014 for your being a champion for all the people.\u00a0 And thank all of you.\u00a0 And thank you, Arizona, for the support that you provided to us and continue to support.\nAnd I promise you \u2014 I promise you not just on the USMCA \u2014 on behalf of President Donald Trump and I, we\u2019re never going to stop fighting for everything the people of Arizona sent us to Washington to do.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to make this nation more prosperous than ever before.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to make this nation safer than ever before.\u00a0 And I know, with your continued support and with the great example of the people of this company, and with God\u2019s help, we\u2019re going to keep America great.\nThanks, everybody.\u00a0 God bless you.\u00a0 God bless Arizona.\u00a0 And God bless America.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEND\n"

Morse Performing Arts Center\nOcala, Florida\n1:47 P.M.\u00a0 EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much.\u00a0 Special place.\u00a0 Really special place.\u00a0 But where I\u2019m disappointed: I said, \u201cWe could have had 25,000 people if we did it outside.\u201d\u00a0 They said \u2014 (applause).\u00a0 Did you see all the people outside?\u00a0 They all want your seat.\u00a0 That\u2019s the way life goes.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And you\u2019re not giving it up.\u00a0 I know you too well.\u00a0 You\u2019re not going to give it up.\u00a0 Please sit down.\u00a0 Let\u2019s enjoy it.\u00a0 Let\u2019s enjoy ourselves.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:\u00a0 We love you, President Trump!\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, you got tremendous crowds out there \u2014 thank you.\u00a0 I love your leg.\u00a0 Look at that, he has my name tattooed on his leg.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 How did you get to The Villages?\u00a0 How do you get to The Villages?\u00a0 Huh?\u00a0 That\u2019s great.\nBut I\u2019m thrilled to be here in one of the most famous and thriving communities anywhere in Florida, and really anywhere in the world, as far as I\u2019m concerned \u2014 The Villages.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn fact, I was thinking about moving to The Villages, but I just couldn\u2019t leave Mar-a-Lago.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t leave it.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I got stuck at Mar-a-Lago.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know.\nBut this has been a great area for us, and it\u2019s been a great part of our victory.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if we got 100 percent, Ron, but it was pretty close, right?\u00a0 Anybody in there didn\u2019t vote for us, right?\u00a0 No, we love it.\u00a0 And we met the folks that built The Villages and that run The Villages, and they\u2019re out here someplace.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve done a fantastic job.\u00a0 Where are they?\u00a0 Where \u2014 they\u2019re here some place.\u00a0 Stand up, please.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 What a job you\u2019ve done.\u00a0 Great job.\u00a0 Great job.\u00a0 And that was started with your grandfather and your father and you folks.\u00a0 And what a great job you\u2019ve done.\nYou know, in my old days, I would have been jealous.\u00a0 Now I couldn\u2019t care less about them.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It\u2019s amazing.\u00a0 It\u2019s amazing how being President can do that to you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSo in my campaign for President, I made you a sacred pledge that I would strengthen, protect, and defend Medicare for all of our senior citizens.\u00a0 And you see it\u2019s under siege, but it\u2019s not going to happen.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nToday, I will sign a very historic executive order that does exactly that: We are making your Medicare even better, and we are not letting anyone \u2014 it will never be taken away from you.\u00a0 We\u2019re not letting anyone get close.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYou see these people on the other side?\u00a0 These people are crazy, by the way.\u00a0 They\u2019re totally crazy.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 But they want to take it away and give you lousy healthcare.\u00a0 It\u2019s pretty incredible.\u00a0 You want to keep your doctors, right?\u00a0 Remember, with Obama \u2014 President Obama, right?\u00a0 He said, \u201cYou can keep your doctor.\u00a0 You can keep your plan.\u201d\u00a0 That didn\u2019t work out too well for the people.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Booo \u2014\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:\u00a0 We\u2019re trying to forget.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Twenty-eight times.\u00a0 He said he\u2019s trying to forget.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 You better never forget, okay?\u00a0 Never forget.\nAs long as I\u2019m President, no one will lay a hand on your Medicare benefits.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do today.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThis order is the latest step in my administration\u2019s drive to ensure the world\u2019s best healthcare for all Americans.\u00a0 Together, we\u2019re creating a healthcare system that protects vulnerable patients, makes healthcare more affordable, gives you more choice and control, and delivers the high-quality care Americans deserve.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing \u2014 we\u2019re strengthening our healthcare system to a level that nobody thought would be possible.\nOur economy is booming.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing fantastically well.\u00a0 I think it gets a little bit hurt by politics.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 But our country is so strong and our economy is so powerful that even politics, and even when you have the \u2014 the \u201cDo-Nothings\u201d \u2014 I call them the \u2014 really, the \u201cDo-Nothing Dems.\u201d\u00a0 They can\u2019t even affect it very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nWe\u2019ve created over 6 million new jobs since the election.\u00a0 The unemployment rate has reached a 51-year low.\u00a0 Two point \u2014 think of that.\u00a0 Think of that.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Then, soon, it\u2019s going to be a historic number, like so many of the other numbers.\n2.5 million people have been lifted out of poverty.\u00a0 That means more Americans that now have \u2014 and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about \u2014 they have a great way of life.\u00a0 They have affordable healthcare options and millions of seniors are enjoying better, healthier, and more prosperous retirements.\u00a0 I should be retiring with you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I should be in this audience, clapping.\u00a0 But I didn\u2019t trust anybody to be standing here, because I know what you have.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Four more years!\u00a0 Four more years!\u00a0 Four more years!\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 It\u2019s true.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t trust anybody.\u00a0 It\u2019s very important.\nAnd nobody has done more in two and a half years \u2014 their first two and a half years \u2014 than what we\u2019ve done.\u00a0 Whether it\u2019s Right to Try, whether it\u2019s tax cuts \u2014 no matter what it is, nobody has done we\u2019ve done.\u00a0 Not even close.\nWe\u2019re delighted to be joined today by a man who is really, really good at \u2014 he ran one of the largest drug companies, and really successfully, and I took him out.\u00a0 Look, that\u2019s where, you know, like \u2014 that\u2019s where the money is.\u00a0 Well, that\u2019s where the knowledge is.\nHe ran one of the biggest, most successful companies.\u00a0 I said, \u201cAlex Azar, come on out.\u00a0 I want to get you to be the top person in charge of this.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cSo, let me ask you, how much bigger is this than the company you\u2019re in?\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s like hundreds of times bigger.\u00a0 It\u2019s a monster.\u00a0 It\u2019s a monster.\u00a0 And what a job.\u00a0 Alex Azar, you know who he is.\u00a0 Where is Alex?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Wherever you are.\u00a0 Alex, thank you.\nAnd he works with Administrator Seema Verma, who has been so incredible.\u00a0 Seema, you have to stand up. What a job. \u00a0(Applause.)\nThey know the most intricate little quarter sentences.\u00a0 You wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u00a0 I\u2019d say, \u201cWhat about this?\u201d\u00a0 And they\u2019d tell me, \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s always like a little roadblock, but we figure our way around.\u201d\nAnd somebody else who is going to be lowering your drug prices with us in a very, very short distance.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to buying them from a slightly different source.\u00a0 A little bit unconventional.\u00a0 A lot of people say I\u2019m unconventional; sometimes you have to be unconventional.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd, Alex, when are we are going to let Governor Ron DeSantis and your incredible First Lady Casey DeSantis \u2014 when are they going to be \u2014 when are they going to be able to do what we want to do?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Alex, when are they going to be able to do what we have to do?\u00a0 \u201cSoon.\u201d\u00a0 Alex says, \u201cSoon.\u201d\u00a0 Because they\u2019re going to have a big fat, beautiful surprise for you.\u00a0 And that has been an incredible couple and a great governor, and the job they\u2019re doing is phenomenal.\u00a0 And I was honored to be very much involved in that campaign.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd if he was doing a lousy job, I\u2019d probably just wouldn\u2019t have shown up today.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But he\u2019s doing one of the best jobs in the whole country.\u00a0 Ron DeSantis.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd also helping Ron and Casey: Jeanette N\u00fa\u00f1ez, your Lieutenant Governor.\u00a0 Jeanette, thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thanks, Jeanette.\u00a0 Great job.\nFlorida Attorney General Ashley Moody.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Ashley, I saw you down there.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nAnd a few warriors we have with us.\u00a0 You know, Ron was one of our warriors.\u00a0 He was in Congress and he was fighting the Russian hoax.\u00a0 That was the Russian witch hunt hoax. \u00a0And he was so impressive that when he said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019d like to run for governor,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019d rather keep you right where you are because they\u2019ll come up with another crazy idea.\u201d\u00a0 But I\u2019m glad I did it.\u00a0 And it worked out well.\nBut we have warriors back in Washington, and you have five of them right here.\u00a0 Gus Bilirakis.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Gus.\u00a0 Where\u2019s Gus?\u00a0 Thank you, Gus.\u00a0 Great job.\u00a0 The legendary Neal Dunn.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Neal, thank you.\u00a0 These guys are warriors.\u00a0 Ross Spano.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thanks, Ross.\u00a0 Michael Waltz.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Michael.\u00a0 Great job he does on television.\u00a0 All of them, they do a great job.\u00a0 They\u2019re defending us.\u00a0 They\u2019re not defending me; they\u2019re defending us, because that was the greatest election victory maybe in history.\u00a0 And they\u2019re defending us.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd a man with one of the best names in the history of politics: Daniel Webster.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 What a name.\u00a0 If I had that name, I would\u2019ve been President 10 years ago.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thanks, Daniel.\u00a0 Thanks, everybody.\u00a0 Great job.\nThey really are \u2014 they\u2019re warriors.\u00a0 They go back and they fight, and they fight corruption.\u00a0 And it\u2019s corruption, what\u2019s going on right now.\u00a0 When you see this going on, it\u2019s pure corruption.\nAs we gather this afternoon, Medicare is under threat like never before.\u00a0 Your know that.\u00a0 You have people that are running for office who \u2014 if it ever happened, you will not be very happy here.\nAlmost every major Democrat in Washington has backed a massive government healthcare takeover that would totally obliterate Medicare.\u00a0 These Democrat policy proposals may go by different names \u2014 they have all of these wonderful names like \u2014\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:\u00a0 Wacko! (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It\u2019ll never end.\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry I smiled.\u00a0 They\u2019ll have me \u2014 the fake news is back there.\u00a0 Look at all of them.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Booo \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 They\u2019ll say, \u201cIt\u2019s terrible.\u00a0 It\u2019s terrible \u2014 the President\u2019s smile.\u201d\u00a0 You know, they want me to admonish you.\u00a0 Who said that?\u00a0 \u201cLock her up.\u201d\u00a0 Stand up, please.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I\u2019m admonishing you.\u00a0 Never ever say that again.\u00a0 That\u2019s okay.\u00a0 Sit down.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 He\u2019s admonished, so now they can\u2019t do their fake number on us.\u00a0 Thank you.\nBut they may go by different names, whether it\u2019s \u201csingle-payer\u201d or the so-called \u201cpublic option,\u201d but they\u2019re all based on the totally same, terrible idea.\u00a0 They want to raid Medicare to fund a thing called socialism.\u00a0 Any socialists in the room?\u00a0 I don\u2019t think so.\u00a0 Not too many.\u00a0 Anybody?\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Booo \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No?\u00a0 No?\u00a0 Not too many in The villages.\u00a0 You don\u2019t \u2014 you\u2019re not big on socialism down here, right?\u00a0 These geniuses \u2014 these real estate geniuses that know we\u2019re not \u2014 not too good.\nEvery one of these plans involves rationing care, restricting access, denying coverage, slashing quality, and massively raising taxes.\u00a0 They want to raise your taxes.\nThey also want to have open borders, so the people can just come in and do whatever they want to do.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Booo \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And they have no idea who\u2019s coming in, by the way.\u00a0 They have no idea.\u00a0 But, you know, when these countries \u2014 and now we\u2019re getting along great with the countries.\u00a0 Mexico gave us 27,000 soldiers guarding our border and the numbers are way down.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Twenty-seven thousand.\u00a0 I want to thank Mexico \u2014 the government and the President.\nCongressional Democrats\u2019 extreme agenda would destroy our booming economy very quickly.\u00a0 One of the most disturbing proposals from left-wing politicians involves draining your healthcare to finance the open borders that we just discussed.\u00a0 That\u2019s how they want to finance it.\u00a0 Leading Democrats have pledged to give free healthcare to illegal immigrants.\u00a0 They put foreign citizens who break our laws and endanger our country \u2014 they put them way ahead of American citizens like you who obey our laws.\nI will never allow these politicians to steal your healthcare and give it away to illegal aliens.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And now, in New York, I hear they passed a new regulation that, if you use the word, \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d \u2014 did I hear correctly?\u00a0 They want to charge you a fine of $250,000.\u00a0 In other words, sell your home in The Villages because you happened to say, \u201cWe don\u2019t like illegal immigrants pouring into our country illegally.\u201d\u00a0 We want people to come into our country legally, through a process.\u00a0 And we\u2019re all in favor of that.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd, by the way, the Fake News will cut that last part of the sentence off.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 They\u2019ll just put the first part.\u00a0 And they\u2019ll say, \u201cMan, is he rough?\u00a0 He\u2019s too tough.\u00a0 I can\u2019t vote for him.\u201d\nA nation must put its own citizens first.\u00a0 My administration is standing up for American seniors.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And we\u2019ll always protect the Medicare benefits you earned and paid for.\nIn the last administration, Democrats slashed Medicare by $800 billion dollars to pay for Obamacare.\u00a0 Not too good \u2014 Obamacare.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Booo \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Now one of their new proposals, backed by more than 130 Democrat members of Congress, would cost \u2014 listen to this number \u2014 $32 trillion dollars.\u00a0 And that\u2019s on the low side \u2014 $32 trillion, with a \u201cT\u201d.\u00a0 We\u2019re beyond the \u201cB\u2019s\u201d, the billions.\u00a0 And reduce Americans\u2019 household income by $17,000 per year.\u00a0 Is there anybody in this room that doesn\u2019t mind losing $17,000 a year?\u00a0 No?\u00a0 In order to get lousy healthcare.\nThough they use many labels, all of the Democrat plans would devastate our healthcare system.\u00a0 The fake moderates on the left are telling the same lies they did under the last administration.\u00a0 But the last administration, frankly, was moderate compared to the maniacs that you\u2019re hearing from today.\u00a0 These are maniacs.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nElizabeth \u201cPocahontas\u201d Warren.\u00a0 You know, when I used to hit her, I thought she was gone, Ron.\u00a0 I thought she was gone.\u00a0 She came up from the ashes.\u00a0 She emerged.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Now, we\u2019re probably going to have to do it again, because I don\u2019t see Sleepy Joe making it, I\u2019ll tell you.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 No, I thought she was gone.\nUnder this administration, we believe that every American family has a right of choice \u2014 you have a right to choose.\u00a0 Choice.\u00a0 So important.\u00a0 Like what we did with the vets.\u00a0 Choice.\u00a0 Where they can go out and get a doctor instead of waiting in line for three weeks, four weeks, two months.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Choice.\u00a0 And you look at the doctor and you look at the plan that is best for you.\nThe truth is, there is no longer a moderate wing of congressional Democrats.\u00a0 They\u2019ve gone crazy.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been hijacked by the radical left.\u00a0 I mean, these people on the left, these people are \u2014\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:\u00a0 Wacko!\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 Is that the same guy?\u00a0 I think so.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I sort of like him.\u00a0 I can\u2019t admonish him again.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I think it\u2019s the same guy.\u00a0 Got a powerful voice.\nDemocrat lawmakers are not trying to build up the country; they only want to wreck and destroy all of the things that we\u2019ve built up over the last three and a half years, four years, five years \u2014 (applause) \u2014 prior to us getting in here.\u00a0 You look at the stock market numbers from the time of the election, from that November 9th date, go a date later.\u00a0 Wasn\u2019t November 8 \u2014 was that one of the great times?\u00a0 Huh?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 2016.\nBut go a day later, and you look at the numbers in the stock market up way over 50 percent.\u00a0 The 401(k)s are doing unbelievably well.\u00a0 One of these people gets in \u2014 your 401(k)s are going to hell, the stock market is going to hell.\u00a0 Frankly, I think \u2014 and I hate to say it \u2014 the country is going to go to hell.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThey\u2019re consumed by rage and radicalism and insatiable lust for power.\u00a0 Well, how about Justice Kavanaugh?\u00a0 They talk about a woman \u2014 (applause).\u00a0 They talk about a woman, about horrible things that he never even thought about.\u00a0 Horrible, horrible things.\u00a0 And the following day, they want to impeach him.\u00a0 And then, the following day, she said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t remember anything.\u00a0 I don\u2019t remember that.\u201d\u00a0 And they say, \u201cWe don\u2019t care.\u00a0 We want to impeach him anyway.\u201d\u00a0 Now, what they\u2019re trying to do is turn his vote liberal.\u00a0 But he\u2019s a much tougher guy than that.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I hope.\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 He\u2019s a much tougher guy.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:\u00a0 So are you!\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you. Yeah, I better be.\u00a0 I\u2019ll tell you.\u00a0 If I weren\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t be up here right now.\u00a0 With all that we have to put up with these people, we wouldn\u2019t be here.\nDemocrat healthcare proposals would put everyone into a single, socialist, government-run program that would end private insurance for over 180 million Americans.\u00a0 I\u2019m sort of smiling to myself as I \u2014 as I go through these numbers.\u00a0 And I\u2019m dealing with people that I know.\u00a0 I mean, I know the people in this room.\u00a0 Those are the people.\u00a0 I grew up with you.\u00a0 When we were young, I grew up with you.\u00a0 And now we\u2019re sort of still young at heart, at least.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd that I\u2019m even talking about socialism is like \u2014 it\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s sort of a weird feeling to be talking to you about \u201cyou don\u2019t want to be socialist.\u201d\u00a0 And you\u2019re probably saying, \u201cWhy is he wasting his time?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut there\u2019s a movement on.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not so easy to be beat them when they get up in a debate and they say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to cut your college tuition to nothing.\u00a0 We\u2019re going kno- \u2014 knock off $1.6 trillion.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to do all these other things.\u00a0 Everything is free, except for your taxes.\u201d\u00a0 Your taxes are going to go up at a level that nobody has even seen before and that won\u2019t be nearly enough to pay for it.\nBut I\u2019ll not let any of this bad stuff happen.\u00a0 It\u2019s very important that we win this race.\u00a0 You know, when we won last time, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s the most important election in our country\u2019s history.\u201d\u00a0 Because we were ready to go over the edge.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd now our country is doing great.\u00a0 But, you know, it\u2019s like a plant \u2014 it\u2019s like a tree.\u00a0 It has to grab \u2014 those roots have to grab hold.\u00a0 We still need more time.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done so much, but we need a little more time.\u00a0 That thing has to grow and it\u2019s got to get in there and then nobody is going to be able to take it down no matter what happens later on.\u00a0 So important. (Applause.)\nIn America, we believe in freedom and liberty, not government domination and government control.\u00a0 Today, standing in solidarity with our nation\u2019s seniors, I declare once again that America will never be a socialist country \u2014 it will never be.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Four more years!\u00a0 Four more years!\u00a0 Four more years!\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You want to drive them crazy?\u00a0 Don\u2019t do \u201cfour more years.\u201d\u00a0 Say \u201ceight more years.\u201d\u00a0 You\u2019ll drive them crazy.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nOne of these crazy maniacs on a show was interviewing somebody \u2014 radical Left \u2014 and he goes, \u201cYou know he\u2019s going to win, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0 Big show.\u00a0 And the guy goes, \u201cNo, no.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to fight him.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to\u2026\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo, no, no.\u00a0 He\u2019s going to win.\u00a0 And you know he\u2019s never getting out.\u00a0 You know that don\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s not going to get out.\u00a0 You know he\u2019s\u2026\u201d\nAnd I thought, like \u2014 you know, he\u2019s a comedian.\u00a0 I thought he was like kidding and having fun.\u00a0 He meant it.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 These people are sick.\u00a0 They meant it.\nAnyway \u2014 but, no, if you want to drive them crazy, just say \u201ceight more years\u201d or \u201ctwelve more years\u201d \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 or \u201csixteen.\u201d\u00a0 Sixteen would do it good.\u00a0 They would \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 you would really drive them into the loony bin.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd that\u2019s why they do the impeachment crap, because they know they can\u2019t beat us fairly.\u00a0 That\u2019s the only reason they\u2019re doing it.\u00a0 They can\u2019t win.\u00a0 They can\u2019t win.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 If they won, it would be a sad day for our country.\u00a0 It\u2019ll be a sad, sad day for our country if they ever won.\nAmong those who would be hit hardest by the socialist takeover are 24 million seniors on Medicare Advantage \u2014 a lot of you.\u00a0 One out of two Hispanic seniors, one out of three African-American seniors is enrolled in Medicare Advantage.\u00a0 This very popular Medicare program \u2014 been around for a long time \u2014 allows private plans to compete to offer senior citizens the absolute best healthcare.\u00a0 They want to destroy it.\nWhile many Democrat plans would eliminate Medicare Advantage, my administration is fighting to make it even better and much, much stronger. (Applause.)\nAnd thanks to our efforts, there are nearly 1,200 more Medicare Advantage plans today than there were just two years ago.\u00a0 Think of that.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Premiums have plummeted by 28 percent; they\u2019ve gone down.\u00a0 And they\u2019re now at the lowest level in over 10 years.\nWith us today is Corey Spangler.\u00a0 She lives just up the road in Summerfield.\u00a0 Corey, please tell us some of what we\u2019ve been discussing on Medicare Advantage and your plan, and how important it is to you.\u00a0 Please, come up, Corey, wherever you may be.\u00a0 Oh, Corey.\nMS. SPANGLER:\u00a0 I\u2019m right here.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you, Corey.\nMS. SPANGLER:\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 My family came to America from Mexico when I was five years old because my father did not like the corruption and we had socialized medicine there.\u00a0 He came to this country legally.\nAnd when I turned 65, I had some heart issues.\u00a0 I went to the doctor.\u00a0 They scheduled me with a cardiologist.\u00a0 He scheduled me for a stress test on a Wednesday.\u00a0 Pass \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014 I failed that test.\u00a0 So he scheduled me for a heart cath the next day.\u00a0 I failed that.\u00a0 They told me you need to have a bypass and I was going to have five bypasses done.\nThe following Monday, I was in surgery with my five pass \u2014 five bypasses, and I went home the following Friday.\u00a0 This would never happen with Medicare for All.\u00a0 I love my Medicare Advantage plan, because I can choose the doctor, when I need it, and get the care I need in a quickly manner.\u00a0 And it wouldn\u2019t happen with Medicare for All.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 That\u2019s beautiful.\nMS. SPANGLER:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President, for saving my care \u2014 healthcare.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you, Corey.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI see a future politician there.\u00a0 That was \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 boy, she was so like calm.\u00a0 No nerves.\u00a0 You know, sometimes I\u2019ll see people, they get a little bit nervous.\u00a0 Very good.\nWhat a job they\u2019ve done.\u00a0 Great doctors.\u00a0 Did you choose your own doctor or you get lucky with a good doctor that was recommended?\nMS. SPANGLER:\u00a0 They were wonderful.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 They were wonderful.\u00a0 That\u2019s fantastic.\u00a0 And you\u2019re wonderful.\u00a0 Thank you, Corey.\u00a0 Appreciate it.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThe Democrat plans for socialized medicine will not just put doctors and hospitals out of business, they\u2019ll also deny your treatment and everything that you need.\u00a0 Government-run healthcare systems always end up imposing rationing.\u00a0 You see what happens.\nYou look at Venezuela; take a look at that.\u00a0 Fifteen years ago, it\u2019s one of the wealthiest countries.\u00a0 Now they don\u2019t have food.\u00a0 They don\u2019t have water.\u00a0 The hospitals are a disaster.\u00a0 No electricity.\u00a0 No anything.\u00a0 It\u2019s very sad.\u00a0 And we\u2019re helping the people as much as we can.\u00a0 But we\u2019re watching that whole situation \u2014 beyond this, we\u2019re watching it very, very carefully.\u00a0\u00a0 We\u2019re watching it very carefully.\u00a0 And Cuba \u2014 we\u2019re watching Cuba very carefully.\u00a0 Very, very carefully.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut as an example, under the United Kingdom\u2019s single-payer system, patients wait 117 days to receive, as an example, a knee replacement.\u00a0 One hundred and seventeen days.\nIn Canada, wait times for orthopedic surgery are over 270 days.\u00a0 But currently in the United States, wait times for these surgeries are \u2014 we\u2019ve speeded it up a lot \u2014 are typically less than two weeks.\u00a0 Is that right, Alex?\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd I have many people coming down from Canada, and I say, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u00a0 They\u2019re getting an operation of some kind.\u00a0 \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get it up there?\u201d\u00a0 They said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like what you\u2019ve been able to do in a short period of time.\u201d\u00a0 And we\u2019re making it even better.\nWith us today is Charles McLaughlin, a 71-year-old Floridian and a Marine veteran of the Vietnam War.\u00a0 Charles, please come up and tell us your story.\u00a0 Please.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMR. MCLAUGHLIN:\u00a0 Oh, man.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nHello to The Villages!\u00a0 What a great place you guys have here.\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 I understand that approximately 60 percent of all of you are veterans.\u00a0 I want to say thank you for your service.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And to my Vietnam brothers and sisters: Welcome home.\n(Applause.)\u00a0 Welcome home.\nMy name is Chuck McLaughlin, and I\u2019m a Vietnam combat Marine.\u00a0 I\u2019m also a cancer survivor \u2014 Stage 4 style.\u00a0 I know a lot about Medicare and the supplement.\u00a0 I used it for breathing tubes, feeding tubes, stitches, staples, MRIs, PET scans, CAT scans, blood tests, hydration shots, chemo treatments, radiation treatments, six months of hypobaric chamber \u2014 to name a few.\nAnyone that\u2019s cured, like me, loves their doctors.\u00a0 Loves their doctors.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I also want to say: My family, financially, would\u2019ve been destroyed without Medicare.\u00a0 Destroyed.\u00a0 The facts are now (inaudible) the politicians on the left are pushing Medicare for All.\u00a0 I say the result will be no Medicare at all.\u00a0 It will collapse under the load \u2014 the load of the system.\u00a0 It will overload of it.\u00a0 The lines would be incredible.\u00a0 Who knows?\u00a0 I probably wouldn\u2019t be here.\nAs far as free stuff, it may be free stuff, but it\u2019s going to come out of somebody else\u2019s pocket.\u00a0 There\u2019s no such thing as \u201cfree.\u201d\u00a0 Period.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIs the Medicare system perfect?\u00a0 No.\u00a0 But it worked for me.\u00a0 Remember, I paid my share.\nJust a few thoughts: President Trump\u2019s plan of Medicare Advantage will give me more flexibility for options to this system.\u00a0 I can pick and choose my needs.\u00a0 Secondly, a program that helps protect us seniors for a fair shake as our bodies fail us.\u00a0 And number three, we must get rid of the waste and fraud that seems to be in the newspapers weekly.\u00a0 Finally, thank you, President Trump, for all you do.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI want to personally thank him for what he does for our veterans.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nFinally, and may God bless you and your family for loving America and giving us a renewed hope for our children and our grandchildren.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 What a great job.\u00a0 Well, thank you very much, Charles.\u00a0 And it\u2019s incredible.\u00a0 You\u2019ve gone through a lot.\nMR. MCLAUGHLIN:\u00a0 Yep.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You don\u2019t look it.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 He\u2019s looking handsome to me, I\u2019ll tell you.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Thanks, Charles.\u00a0 That\u2019s incredible.\nLike you, all of us today understand the truth.\u00a0 Socialism is not about improving the health of American people; it\u2019s about wielding power over the American people, taking things away from the American people.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn a few moments, I will sign an executive order to strengthen Medicare for seniors, and very substantially.\u00a0 I\u2019ll provide Medicare Advantage plans with new tools and options, and it will help Medicare beneficiaries gain faster access to the very latest and greatest medical devices and therapies.\nMy order also pursues reductions in the unnecessary regulations that you don\u2019t need, you don\u2019t want to see \u2014 that never come into effect and that cost a lot of money \u2014 enabling doctors and nurses to spend less time on paperwork and more time with their patients that they love.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTo further protect seniors, we are taking action to stop fraud and to stop abuse.\u00a0 It\u2019s tremendous amounts of money saved with that.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll be able to put that money right back into what we want to have it to take care of you.\nI\u2019m directing Secretary Azar to crack down on criminals, cheaters, and dishonest providers who rob Medicare of the funds you have and the money that you\u2019ve paid into the system all of your lives.\u00a0 Charles said it.\u00a0 Charles said, \u201cYou know, I paid for it.\u201d\u00a0 He said he paid for it.\u00a0 And now they want to say, \u201cLet\u2019s give it to everybody else.\u201d\u00a0 And it\u2019s going to be gone in a very short number of years.\u00a0 But you did pay for it.\u00a0 You both paid for it.\nToday\u2019s action is the only really great action that we can take.\u00a0 It\u2019s the only choice we have because this is going to be something that\u2019s better than any place anywhere in the world.\u00a0 It\u2019s the latest of many important steps that we\u2019re taking to dramatically improve healthcare for the American people.\nOur vision for the future of health in America has four crucial parts.\u00a0 And we will protect vulnerable patients, number one.\u00a0 We will protect those patients that are so terribly vulnerable.\u00a0 We will deliver the affordability that you need.\u00a0 Prices coming down.\u00a0 As I said, prescription drug prices \u2014 first time in over 50 years, Alex, that drug prices have come down for the year.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Your average prescription drug price \u2014 first time in 50 years \u2014 over 50 years.\nAnd we\u2019re going to get them a lot lower.\u00a0 And I think Ron is going to have some big surprises.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be announcing that pretty soon.\u00a0 Some \u2014 for really, really big reductions.\u00a0 People are already \u2014 they\u2019re not even going to know what happened.\u00a0 So that\u2019s what we want.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd we\u2019re going to give you options and control that you want.\u00a0 And we will provide the quality you deserve.\nFirst, we\u2019re protecting vulnerable Americans.\nWe have made a clear promise to America\u2019s patients: We will always protect patients with preexisting conditions.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 The Republicans will always protect preexisting conditions.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTo stop families from being blindsided by outrageous medical bills \u2014 and this is something that is one of the most exciting things to me \u2014 I have challenged Congress to send a bill to my desk that stops the horrendous practice of surprise medical billing.\u00a0 So many of you, you go in and you have something, and then you get a bill and you say, \u201cHow is it possible?\u201d\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to end that practice.\u00a0 That practice is not a fair practice.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd we\u2019re also confronting the opioid and drug addiction epidemic that is plaguing too many American communities.\u00a0 And thanks to our efforts \u2014 and we\u2019ve worked so hard on it; the First Lady worked so hard.\u00a0 Kellyanne Conway \u2014 where\u2019s Kellyanne?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0\u00a0 Where\u2019s Kellyanne?\u00a0 Where is she?\u00a0 Kellyanne, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you, Kellyanne.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nLast year, drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly three decades.\u00a0 Early data shows that drug overdose deaths dropped 10 percent last year in the state of Florida.\u00a0 Now, think of that.\u00a0 That\u2019s \u2014 you know, we\u2019d like to better.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very, very tough situation.\u00a0 And one of the things we\u2019re doing with the \u201cpain pills\u201d \u2014 we can call them \u2014 we\u2019re trying to find, and we\u2019re really working hard and we\u2019re funding a lot of research to find pain pills that aren\u2019t addictive.\u00a0 You go into to a hospital with a broken arm, and you come out and you\u2019re drug addict.\u00a0 And we\u2019re trying to find, and we\u2019re getting closer \u2014 I think we\u2019re getting very close, actually \u2014 to finding painkillers that aren\u2019t addictive.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll have that in the not-too-distant future.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd to care for our great veterans, we passed VA Accountability.\u00a0 You know what that is, right?\u00a0 This is where the great heroes and tough people \u2014 but \u2014 and, by the way, in their super prime, nobody touched them.\nBut they\u2019re more vulnerable, and people would take advantage of our veterans.\u00a0 You had sadists.\u00a0 You had people that would rob them and rob the system.\u00a0 You had some horrible people.\u00a0\u00a0 We couldn\u2019t fire anybody.\u00a0 They had, in Arizona, people that got stealing \u2014 they got caught stealing $400,000.\u00a0 They couldn\u2019t fire them.\u00a0 So now we have VA Accountability.\u00a0 You think that was easy?\u00a0 They\u2019ve been trying to get it for 50 years.\u00a0 And I got it.\u00a0 I\u2019m good at getting things.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo now, when they don\u2019t take proper care of our vets, we say, \u201cJim, get the hell out of here.\u00a0 You\u2019re fired.\u00a0 Get out of here.\u201d\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We can fire them.\u00a0 Get them out.\u00a0 We get them out.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have to ask questions.\u00a0 We get them out.\u00a0 If they\u2019re bad, they treat our veterans badly, we fire them.\u00a0 That\u2019s why you don\u2019t hear about \u2014 you know, before me, every night you\u2019d see these stories, these horror stories about the VA.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t seen one in a long time.\u00a0 Now, I don\u2019t want to wish it because the fake news will search the system \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 to find somebody that\u2019s not happy.\u00a0 \u201cWe found somebody.\u00a0 We found a vet in Florida who isn\u2019t quite happy with everything.\u00a0 Let\u2019s do a major story.\u201d\nBut do you remember all of the bad stories that used to be about the VA?\u00a0 Now you don\u2019t see that because they have accountability.\u00a0 We can fire bad people.\u00a0 We fired a tremendous number of really bad people that should\u2019ve been fired years ago.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI don\u2019t like firing people, but I like firing people that don\u2019t treat our vets great, that aren\u2019t doing their job.\u00a0 And they were protected, frankly, by the unions, and they were protected by civil service \u2014 very powerful.\u00a0 Do you think it was easy beating unions and civil service?\u00a0 Not too easy.\u00a0 But I explained to them too.\u00a0 I said, \u201cThis is good for all of us.\u00a0 It\u2019s good for America.\u201d\nAnd the other, as I said, is VA Choice, where our veterans no longer have to wait for endless, endless hours, days \u2014 even months.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had cases where a person is on line \u2014 not bad; could be fixed up very easily with whatever treatment it may be \u2014 and they end up being terminal by the time they see a doctor.\u00a0 That\u2019s not happening anymore.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Because now you go out, you find a great local doctor, we pay the bill.\nAnd, you know, it\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s totally less important but we also save a lot of money on that. \u00a0Hard to believe, we save a lot of money.\u00a0 It\u2019s much less expensive for us to do that than the other way, and it\u2019s saving tremendous numbers of lives.\u00a0 And we have great doctors, frankly, that need the business.\u00a0 Not so bad.\nTo protect healthcare for our seniors and all Americans, my administration is taking strong actions to ensure that newcomers to our society do not drain our healthcare system, or burden the services that you depend on.\u00a0 You see these people in California, the governor of California \u2014 \u201cCome on in, everybody.\u201d\u00a0 Then you wonder why people are flooding our borders. \u201cCome on in.\u00a0 You have free education, free healthcare.\u00a0 Everybody gets a Rolls-Royce.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 \u201cCome on in.\u00a0 Come on in.\u201d\nYou know, to show you how corrupt CNN is, when I used that expression, they said, \u201cThe President wasn\u2019t telling the truth.\u00a0 He said they get a Rolls-Royce and they don\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Ahh, they don\u2019t get it, do they?\u00a0 They never got it.\nSome idiot at CNN said, \u201cYou can\u2019t win without CNN.\u00a0 I guess we showed them.\u201d (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 I guess we showed them.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And their ratings are so low now that they are no longer the big difference at all.\u00a0 They have really bad ratings.\nBut you know what is bad for our country?\u00a0 When CNN \u2014 so often I go to a foreign country.\u00a0 I go to a country.\u00a0 I meet leaders.\u00a0 And he said, \u201cWhy do they hate your country so much?\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cWho?\u201d\u00a0 You know, CNN outside of the United States is much more important than it is in the United States.\u00a0 And a lot of what you see here is broadcast throughout the world.\u00a0 And we used to have Radio Free \u2014 I think Radio Free Europe and Voice of America.\u00a0 And we did that to build up our country.\u00a0 And that\u2019s not working out too well.\nBut CNN is a voice that really seems to be the voice out there.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a terrible thing for our country.\u00a0 And we ought to start our network and put some real news out there because they are so bad.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 They are so bad for our country.\u00a0 They are so bad for our country.\u00a0 I go out there and they say, \u201cBoy, the media hates your country.\u201d\u00a0 And it\u2019s just a shame.\u00a0 It\u2019s just a shame.\u00a0 And we really are \u2014 we are looking at that.\u00a0 We should do something about it, too.\u00a0 Put some really talented people and get a real voice out there, not a voice that\u2019s fake.\nWhen Americans are struck by natural disaster, like they were in Florida where I was with you, Hurricane Michael \u2014 did I do a good job, Governor?\u00a0 Did I do a good job?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Man.\nYour governor came to my office once a week.\u00a0 He always needed more money \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 and I always gave it, right?\u00a0 He didn\u2019t stop.\u00a0 I hated it.\u00a0 I said, \u201cKeep DeSantis.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to see him anymore.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But we always gave it, and you got it.\u00a0 And your people worked so hard.\u00a0 And FEMA and the military, they all worked with you.\u00a0 The Coast Guard is incredible, what the Coast Guard has done.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I think the Coast Guard has really done a great job.\nThe second part of our healthcare agenda is to promote the affordability of America\u2019s needs.\u00a0 Thanks to our focus on lower drug prices, the FDA approved more low-cost generic drugs in my first two years than ever before in the history of our country. Think of that.\u00a0 Think of that.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd every time I\u2019d see the folks over at FDA, I\u2019d say, \u201cCome on, fellas.\u00a0 Let\u2019s go.\u00a0 Faster.\u00a0 Faster.\u201d\u00a0 You know, don\u2019t forget, when somebody was dying and we had a drug that looked like it was really good but it wasn\u2019t going be approved for like four more years \u2014 it used to be 12 years and we brought it way down.\u00a0 I mean, it\u2019s too long.\u00a0 But we brought it way, way down.\u00a0 But a person is dying and they said, \u201cNo, sir, we can\u2019t give that because it may harm the person.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cWait a minute, you don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 \u201cA person is terminally ill, they\u2019ve got four weeks to live, and you don\u2019t want to give them a drug because you think it\u2019s going to harm them?\u00a0 I guarantee you I can get them to sign a document.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nNow we got that approved \u2014 Right to Try.\u00a0 And, by the way, miracles are happening.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 Miracles.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Miracles are happening.\nHopefully, it never happens to anybody in this room.\u00a0 But, frankly, people would go to Asia, they\u2019d go to Europe, they\u2019d go all over the world seeking a cure, if they had money.\u00a0 If they didn\u2019t have money, they\u2019d go home and they\u2019d die.\u00a0 But now they don\u2019t have to do that.\nAnd it wasn\u2019t easy because the drug companies didn\u2019t want it because they didn\u2019t want to have terminally ill because it looks bad on the percentage record, right?\u00a0 The insurance companies didn\u2019t want it because there are a lot of reasons.\u00a0 You know what the reasons are.\u00a0 Our government didn\u2019t want it because they didn\u2019t want to be sued by a patient that died that would\u2019ve died anyway.\u00a0 So I said, \u201cHere\u2019s what we do, folks: We sign an agreement.\u00a0 And the agreement holds everybody non-liable.\u201d\nWe took the drug companies and we created a separate list, so they\u2019re not on that list \u2014 because it is, right?\u00a0 It\u2019s a problem.\u00a0 And we took a separate list.\u00a0 So now we have a totally separate list \u2014 confidential list \u2014 but they don\u2019t get hurt by somebody that was so sick that this person may not make it.\u00a0 And I got everybody to sign it and we were done.\u00a0 It was pretty amazing.\u00a0 And then we got it approved in Congress because of these five great congressmen back there, including Ron, who at the time was in Congress.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 With Greg and everybody, we got it done and we got the Senate to approve it.\u00a0 And I signed it.\u00a0 And I was really happy.\u00a0 Right to Try.\u00a0 Hopefully you never need it.\nWe also ended the terrible gag clauses that prevented pharmacists from telling you about cheaper options at the pharmacy counter.\u00a0 Do you believe it?\u00a0 I thought this was \u2014 I thought they were kidding me the first time.\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget, I\u2019ve only been doing this for three years, okay?\u00a0 So, you know.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nThese guys have been doing it a long time.\u00a0 But they\u2019re not allowed to talk to you about pricing.\u00a0 I said, \u201cWait.\u00a0 You\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d\u00a0 And they weren\u2019t.\u00a0 But I got rid of that.\u00a0 Now they can talk about pricing.\u00a0 You can go out and price.\u00a0 You can go to different places.\u00a0 They have to be open and transparent.\u00a0 That was a big deal.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 That was a big deal.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd all of these things, you know, they sound so simple; they\u2019re tough to get.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been that way for many years for a reason.\u00a0 You have very powerful lobbyists.\u00a0 You have drug companies, frankly, that don\u2019t want that.\u00a0 Why would they want that, where you can negotiate price?\u00a0 Why would they want a thing like that?\nMy administration is also working to require drug companies to disclose prices in their television advertisements.\u00a0 And we\u2019re almost getting to a point where we\u2019re going to be able to get that.\u00a0\u00a0 So you\u2019re going to know what you\u2019re paying up front.\u00a0 They can\u2019t triple-hit you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEssentially, we\u2019re holding Big Pharma accountable.\u00a0 And that\u2019s okay; they do just fine.\nEarlier this year, we announced another groundbreaking action seniors have wanted for decades.\u00a0 We will soon allow the safe and legal importation of prescription drugs from other countries, including the country of Canada, where, believe it or not, they pay much less money for the exact same drug.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Stand up, Ron.\u00a0 Boy, he wants this so badly.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNo, I mean, you go to some countries and the price is like 50, 60 percent lower \u2014 even more than that, I guess, Ron, in some cases.\u00a0 And it\u2019s 50, 60 percent lower \u2014 the exact same pill, from the exact same factory, from the exact same company.\u00a0 And I say, \u201cWhy is it that in Europe \u2014 certain places, in particular \u2014 it\u2019s 25 percent of what we pay back here?\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cIt must be a different manufacturer.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo, sir, it\u2019s the same one.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cMust be made in a different factory.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo, sir, it\u2019s the same one.\u201d\u00a0 Everything is identical; they pay 25 percent.\u00a0 We pick up all of the research and development.\u00a0 We pick up everything like a bunch of, excuse me, schmucks.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Schmucks.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 (Applause.)\nNot anymore, folks, because in a little while \u2014 (applause) \u2014 in a little while, your governor is going to be able to go out and negotiate until his heart is content.\u00a0 And he\u2019s going to go to Canada.\u00a0 I know he\u2019s gone there already and he\u2019s looking at their pricing, and he\u2019s going to some of the European countries and others, and he\u2019s going to get his drug price down to a level that you can\u2019t believe.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be a great thing.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll see what happens.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be very interesting.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd I have a feeling when that happens, the drug companies are just going to say, \u201cWe can\u2019t have this.\u201d\u00a0 And they\u2019re going to drop their price, I think.\nNow, they\u2019re very smart.\u00a0 They may go the other way, and if they do, don\u2019t blame me, okay?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re going to do fantastically, Ron.\u00a0 You feel good about it?\u00a0 Huh?\u00a0 You better do good; otherwise, you\u2019re making us both look bad.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 You hear that, Casey?\nAmerican patients must no longer be forced to subsidize lower drug prices in other countries through higher prices in America.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we were doing.\u00a0 We were paying a much higher price.\u00a0 My administration will never stop fighting for lower costs for American patients and American seniors.\nThe third part of our healthcare vision is to provide the choice and control Americans want.\u00a0 We eliminated Obamacare\u2019s horrible, horrible, very expensive and very unfair, unpopular individual mandate.\u00a0 A total disaster.\u00a0 That was a big penalty.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 That was a big thing.\u00a0 Where you paid a lot of money for the privilege of not having to pay a lot of money for the privilege of having no healthcare.\u00a0 You paid not to have healthcare.\u00a0 It was a penalty.\u00a0 And how it ever held up in Supreme Court, I don\u2019t know, but it did.\u00a0 But we just got rid of it.\u00a0 We just did it the old-fashioned way: We got rid of it.\nWe vastly expanded affordable insurance options, including association health plans, short-term plans, and health reimbursement arrangements \u2014 which are incredible.\u00a0 And many of these options are up to 60 percent less expensive than \u201cO-bomb-a-care.\u201d\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Nobody got that.\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 Nobody got that.\u00a0 That\u2019s okay.\u00a0 \u201cO-bomb-a-care.\u201d\u00a0 I didn\u2019t say \u201cObamacare.\u201d\u00a0 I said \u201cO-bomb-a-care.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 President \u201cO-bomb-a-care.\u201d\u00a0 He can have it.\nBut we\u2019ve done a great job in running it.\u00a0 We almost had it done.\u00a0 We unfortunately had one vote \u2014 middle of the night \u2014 just when thumbs down.\u00a0 That wasn\u2019t good.\u00a0 After years and years of campaigning \u2014 \u201crepeal and replace,\u201d right?\u00a0 But we\u2019ve done a great job because we get rid of the individual mandate.\u00a0 And we\u2019re running it better.\u00a0 It\u2019s still no good, because it\u2019s too expensive.\u00a0 The premium is way too high and all of the elements of it.\u00a0 It\u2019s just not good.\u00a0 But we\u2019re coming up with an incredible plan that if the Republicans take back the House, keep the Senate, keep the presidency, we\u2019re going to have a fantastic plan.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Right?\nFollowing my administration\u2019s recommendation, Florida has taken an important step to lower cost and increase choice by repealing a misguided Certificate of Need law, used by hospitals to block competition.\u00a0 We encourage other states to follow Florida\u2019s example.\u00a0 They\u2019ve done a great job right here.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd I also signed, just recently, a revolutionary executive order requiring price and quality transparency.\u00a0 And the man who\u2019s really the leader in the world of this \u2014 it\u2019s transparency.\u00a0 You can pick your doctor; you can look at their records; you can see how well they did.\u00a0 You can go and negotiate.\u00a0 A man \u2014 what really sold me on it \u2014 the man who\u2019s the best in the world at it, who we used, and we gave you the max plan.\u00a0 Did we give that?\u00a0 The max plan, right?\u00a0 That\u2019s the maximum plan.\u00a0 We gave it to you.\u00a0 And he said something that I loved.\u00a0 He said, \u201cSir, this is more important and will go down as more important than any healthcare that you\u2019ll ever come up with.\u201d\u00a0 And I said, \u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d\u00a0 Now, who knows if it\u2019s true, but I guess, from what I\u2019m hearing, they\u2019ve done it in certain limited areas and it\u2019s phenomenal.\nAnd it\u2019s really transparency.\u00a0 And you\u2019ll be able to negotiate all over the place.\u00a0 And you\u2019ll be able to pick everything you want, from the hospital to the doctor.\u00a0 And it\u2019s going to save you a tremendous amount of money.\u00a0 And there are those that say it\u2019s more important than even healthcare at a high \u2014 at a high level.\nAnd fourth, my administration is fighting to ensure the high-quality care that Americans deserve.\u00a0 Americans have to get the highest quality.\u00a0 So we have the highest quality that Americans deserve.\nOn behalf of 5 million Americans living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, I signed into law a $1 billion increase in funding for critical Alzheimer\u2019s research.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve made a lot of progress.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd just one other thing I will tell you \u2014 because it even surprised me \u2014 but we\u2019ve funded it now, and, within 10 years, our country will be AIDS-free.\u00a0 Can you believe that?\u00a0 AIDS-free.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Tremendous progress has been made.\nAnd when we were talking about that, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u00a0 How does this\u2026\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s like somewhat of a secret, but it\u2019s incredible \u2014 the tremendous progress that we\u2019ve made over the last few years on AIDS and AIDS research.\u00a0 And we should be essentially AIDS-free.\u00a0 Do you agree with that, Mr. Secretary?\nIn my State of the Union, I announced a plan to invest \u2014 (laughs) \u2014 she liked it \u2014 $500 million dollars in new treatments, and cures, and all of the things that we have to go through with our incredible children, in some cases, for childhood cancers.\u00a0 It\u2019s a tremendous problem.\nAnd to bring new hope to the nearly 100,000 Americans currently awaiting a kidney operation, I signed an executive order that will significantly increase the supply of kidneys available for transplant.\u00a0 It\u2019s such a big deal.\u00a0 It\u2019s so big.\u00a0 You have no idea.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd we worked hard on that.\u00a0 And, you know, what a lot of people don\u2019t know \u2014 a lot of it is just the work.\u00a0 The people die fairly quickly because it\u2019s not \u2014 they could go on forever.\u00a0 But it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s unbelievable amounts of work, going in all the time for step-by-step \u2014 what you have to do.\nAnd so, with kidney transplants, we\u2019re making tremendous progress.\u00a0 And we funded a lot of money toward it.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s going to be a tremendous thing for people that are just literally suffering with something they can really do very well with.\nWe\u2019re delivering better, fairer, and more affordable healthcare for all Americans, especially our cherished senior citizens.\u00a0 And we will stop at nothing to deliver better healthcare for you and for your family.\u00a0 I will never let you down.\u00a0 You have been incredible to me and I will never ever forget you.\u00a0 I will never let you down.\u00a0 I promise that.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nWe\u2019re lowering the cost of prescription drugs, taking on the pharmaceutical companies.\u00a0 And you think that\u2019s easy? It\u2019s not easy.\u00a0 It\u2019s not easy.\u00a0 They come at you from all different sides.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the hoax didn\u2019t come a little bit from some of the people that we\u2019re taking on.\u00a0 They\u2019re very powerful.\u00a0 They spend a lot of money \u2014 spend, I think, more money than any other group in the world actually, in terms of lobbying and lobbying abilities.\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some of the nonsense that we all have to go through, but that I go through \u2014 wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was from these \u2014 some of these industries like pharmaceuticals that we take on because I want \u2014 I don\u2019t care.\u00a0 I did great.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had a great life.\u00a0 I want to get drug prices down.\u00a0 I don\u2019t care about the companies I want to get drug prices down.\nI want to continue to give them the incentive to come out with new and better answers, but got to get drug prices down.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve made a fortune over the last 40 years.\u00a0 They\u2019ve made so much money.\u00a0 And they\u2019ve got the system wired.\u00a0 Because everything you do, their stock goes up.\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u00a0 Their stock just went up.\u201d\u00a0 They said, \u201cSir, it\u2019s going to be wonderful.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be wonderful.\u201d\u00a0 Let their stock go down a little bit.\u00a0 But their stock goes up.\u00a0 And what we\u2019ve done is incredible.\nAnd, by the way, you have some incredible companies.\u00a0 The answers that they \u2014 we \u2014 we want to keep them strong and powerful and wealthy, and we want them to con- \u2014 really continue to do that research.\u00a0 But we got to get those prices down.\u00a0 They\u2019re far too high, especially when you compare them to other countries.\nAnd we want to ensure access to the doctors of your choice.\u00a0 And every day, we are going to \u2014 as I said, we are going to defend Medicare like Medicare has never been defended again.\u00a0 And it\u2019s never needed the defense.\u00a0 It\u2019s always been incredible.\u00a0 It\u2019s something that worked and they want to destroy it.\nIn my administration, we know that Medicare is personal.\u00a0 Great healthcare is about more time with the ones you love, more days with your grandkids, and more freedom to enjoy the most rewarding years of your life \u2014 or what should be, by far, the most rewarding years of your life.\u00a0 You\u2019ve worked hard.\u00a0 You\u2019ve worked so hard.\u00a0 And you paid for it.\u00a0 And you\u2019ve got to enjoy it.\u00a0 It\u2019s about getting better when you\u2019re sick, it\u2019s improving your well-being, and it\u2019s getting the treatment you need, right when you need it.\nThat\u2019s why, in everything we do, we are defending the principles that made America the envy of the world and the American way of life the greatest in our history.\u00a0 And our country has never been greater than it\u2019s been right now.\u00a0 Our military is the strongest it\u2019s ever built \u2014 we rebuilt our entire military.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd even medical research is at a new level.\u00a0 It\u2019s at a level that we\u2019ve never had it before.\nWe stand for freedom.\u00a0 We stand for choice.\u00a0 We stand for justice, and fairness, and accountability.\u00a0 We stand for loyalty to our citizens, love for our country, allegiance to our flag, and long and healthy lives for our great seniors.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd with your help, we are going to continue building the best, most advanced, most cutting-edge healthcare system anywhere in the world.\u00a0 We are going to expand our growing economy to make retirement easier, and better, and far more secure.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to defend American lives, American values, American families, and America\u2019s glorious destiny.\u00a0 There is no country like our country.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We see and read things, but there is no country like our country.\u00a0 Right?\nWith every ounce of strength and every bit of soul, we are going to protect Medicare for you \u2014 for everyone at The Villages, and for every senior across this magnificent land.\nYou are going to be protected in many ways \u2014 but you are going to be protected.\nThank you very being here.\u00a0 Thank you for this incredible enthusiasm.\u00a0 God bless you.\u00a0 God bless our senior citizens.\u00a0 And God bless America.\u00a0 Thank you very much, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\nOkay.\u00a0 Should I do it? \u00a0(Applause.)\u00a0 I\u2019ll do it.\u00a0 All right.\n(The executive order is signed.)\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThank you everybody.\u00a0 Here \u2014 grab these, fellas.\u00a0 Pass them around.\u00a0 The congressmen don\u2019t want (inaudible), and I know that.\u00a0 Here you go.\u00a0 I love that.\u00a0 I love that.\u00a0 I love those guys.\u00a0 \u201cBikers for 45.\u201d \u00a0These guys.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 They\u2019ve been there from the beginning, right?\u00a0 Here.\u00a0 Pass them around.\u00a0 Pass these around, fellas.\u00a0 Pass them around.\nCome here.\u00a0 Attorney General, get over here.\u00a0 Come on.\u00a0 Get over here.\u00a0 Lieutenant Governor, come on.\u00a0 Please, both of you.\u00a0 Come on up here.\u00a0 They\u2019re doing a good job, right?\u00a0 Should we give them a pen?\u00a0 I think so.\u00a0 (Applause.) \u00a0Come on up here.\u00a0 That\u2019s great.\nI want to thank you all.\u00a0 Really a special time.\u00a0 And this is \u2014 this is very meaningful for me and for you and for everybody.\u00a0 Thank you all very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEND\n2:49 P.M.

        "text": "First Baptist Church of Scottsdale\nScottsdale, Arizona\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you all for coming out.\u00a0 It\u2019s great to be in Phoenix at a time when this city, this state, and this nation are experiencing an economic boom, the likes of which the American people haven\u2019t seen for a very long time.\nThanks to the policies that Senator McSally has supported throughout her career and Governor Ducey has been advancing here in Arizona, we\u2019ve seen over the last two and a half years, 6.3 million jobs created.\u00a0 Hundreds of thousands of jobs created here in Arizona.\nAnd as we started today celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month, it was a special joy to be able to reflect on the fact that more than 2 million of those jobs have gone to Hispanic Americans.\u00a0 And particularly, Hispanic women have been winning in this economy almost more than any other individual group.\nTalking about the fact that under President Trump\u2019s leadership, with our strong allies in the Senate and also at state capitols around the country, we\u2019ve been able to cut taxes, roll back regulations at a historic level, unleash American energy, fight for the kind of free and fair trade deals that\u2019ll expand jobs and opportunity in this country.\u00a0 And the results really speak for themselves.\nBut as the President often says, for all of the progress that we\u2019ve made \u2014 6 million new jobs, a booming economy \u2014 that\u2019s just what President Trump calls \u201ca good start.\u201d\u00a0 And so I\u2019ll be traveling with the Governor and Senator McSally down to Tucson today to make one more case for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\u00a0 And while we see Congress once again heading down the pathway of controversy and endless investigations, we believe the time has come for Congress to set aside politics and pass the USMCA.\nThe United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement was negotiated and finished roughly a year ago.\u00a0 And ever since that time, Congress has been looking at it, studying it, discussing it.\u00a0 Yet all the while, Mexico and Canada have both taken decisive steps to put what will be the largest trade deal in American history into effect.\nA conservative estimate of the impact on our economy is that USMCA will create more than 175,000 good-paying jobs all across this country.\u00a0 And we really believe, in a very real sense, it also ends the incentive of American businesses to move south of the border, and also it protects intellectual property rights and deals with issues, even including the environment that previous trade agreements have never done in a significant way.\nThe USMCA is a win for American jobs.\u00a0 It\u2019s a win for American workers.\u00a0 And I specifically want to thank Governor Ducey for being a national voice in support of the USMCA.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll be traveling to Tucson to make that case because we have tremendous momentum in this economy.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen manufacturing come roaring back.\u00a0 And in every aspect of this economy, we know the USMCA is going to continue to build on that momentum.\nSo it\u2019s great to be here in Arizona.\u00a0 We look forward to being back again and again.\u00a0 And it\u2019s also, finally, especially great to be here with Senator Martha McSally who is, in her own right, an American hero, a woman who made history in the Armed Forces of the United States, served with great distinction in the House of Representatives working with this administration, and, I can tell you, has already emerged as a preeminent leader in the Republican majority in the United States Senate.\u00a0 And she has President Trump and my full support.\u00a0 We look forward to standing with her all the way through a great day a year from this November in Arizona and around the country.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. Vice President, sir, you alluded to a politics of endless investigations.\u00a0 Perhaps you\u2019ll forgive me for asking about it.\u00a0 Can you say what you spoke about with President Zelensky when you met with him in Poland, and whether the Bidens came up \u2014 whether you mentioned the Bidens at all with him?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, as I said the day after that meeting, we focused entirely, in my meeting with President Zelensky of Ukraine, on the issues that President Trump has raised as a concern, namely the lack of support from European partners for Ukraine and real issues of corruption in Ukraine.\nBut the American people have every right to ensure that when we\u2019re investing hundreds of millions of dollars to support the territorial integrity and the sovereignty and the security of Ukraine, that those dollars are being spent in a way that\u2019s honest and represents a government free of corruption.\nThe good news is President Zelensky was elected last spring on an anti-corruption message.\u00a0 And before the summer was out, he elected a large majority in his parliament also on a message of anti-corruption.\u00a0 And when we spoke roughly a month ago in Poland, President Zelensky reported to me the literally hundreds of bills on corruption reform that his party was introducing and moving; the steps that he was taking to deal with corruption in Ukraine.\u00a0 And also committed to me that he would work with the United States to call on our European partners to do more, to push back on Russian aggression \u2014 the Russian aggression that essentially took over Crimea and also has fomented war in the Donbass area of Ukraine now for years.\u00a0 And those were the topics that we discussed.\u00a0 That was all we discussed.\nBut the simple truth is that those are the same issues that the President raised with President Zelensky in their call.\u00a0 Now, the President spoke about lack of European support, he spoke about corruption, and he tasked me to go and to meet with the President of Ukraine and carry our concerns about those issues.\nAnd anyone that looks at the President\u2019s transcript will see that the President was raising issues that were appropriate, that were of genuine interest to the American people.\nAnd as more facts come out of this, as people take time to read the transcript of the President\u2019s call and reflect on these facts, I think they\u2019ll come to realize this is just more of the same of what we\u2019ve seen from Democrats for the last two and a half years.\nThey\u2019ve literally spent two and a half years pushing an impeachment of this administration and this President on a theory of Russian collusion and obstruction.\u00a0 And when that didn\u2019t pan out, they briefly tried to talk about impeaching Justice Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court.\u00a0 And over the last 10 days, we\u2019re back to talking impeachment.\nI think the people of America are saying enough is enough.\u00a0 I mean, people of this country want us to focus on issues that matter most to them.\u00a0 These endless investigations should end in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 And Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats ought to be focusing on issues of security, of prosperity, of infrastructure, the USMCA, lowering drug prices, and whatever they want to fight about in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 I promise you: President Trump and I are going to keep fighting for the issues that matter most for the American people.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What was your biggest takeaway from today\u2019s meeting?\u00a0 What was your biggest takeaway?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 My biggest takeaway is how proud the Hispanic American community is here in Arizona and in this country.\u00a0 I mean, when you look at the growth and the prosperity that\u2019s happened since 2016 in the state of Arizona, and you understand the role that Hispanic Americans have played in that, it was a real cause for celebration today.\nAnd we\u2019re going to take this whole month \u2014 Hispanic Heritage Month \u2014 to talk about the incredible cultural contributions, community contributions, but economic contributions that Hispanic Americans make every day.\nMy big message was: As we see an economy that\u2019s created 6.3 million new jobs, it\u2019s been Hispanic Americans, Hispanic small businesses, Hispanic entrepreneurs that have been driving that economic renaissance.\u00a0 And there was a lot of optimism in the room and a lot of appreciation for the policies that are really making this economy great again.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is it appropriate, as the President did this morning and in a phone call with Ukraine, to ask foreign governments to investigate his political rival?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 China, for example.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, let me say that, I\u2019m Vice President of the United States, and I was elected to this job, along with President Trump for many reasons.\u00a0 One was to re- \u2014 excuse me.\u00a0 We were elected for many reasons.\u00a0 One was to rebuild our military.\u00a0 One was to revive our economy.\u00a0 Another was to see conservatives appointed to our courts.\u00a0 Another was to secure our borders.\u00a0 But one of the main reasons we were elected to Washington, D.C. was to drain the swamp.\nAnd I think the American people have a right to know if the Vice President of the United States or his family profited from this position as Vice President during the last administration.\u00a0 That\u2019s about looking backwards and understanding what really happened.\u00a0 I mean, the fact that my predecessor had a son who was paid $50,000 a month to be on a Ukrainian board at the time that Vice President Biden was leading the Obama administration\u2019s efforts in Ukraine \u2014 I think is worth looking into.\nAnd the President made it very clear that he believes \u2014 he believes our other nations around the world should look into it as well.\u00a0 I mean, the simple fact is that, you know, when you hold the second highest office in the land, it comes with unique responsibilities \u2014 not just to be above impropriety, but to be above the appearance of impropriety.\u00a0 And clearly, in this case, there are legitimate questions that ought to be asked.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to continue to ask them since the American people have a right to know whether or not the Vice President of the United States or his family profited from his position.\nI mean, you look at the video of Vice President Biden and you see there was clearly a quid pro quo.\u00a0 He said, if a prosecutor was not fired \u2014 who, among other things, was investigating the company his son sat on the board of \u2014 that he was going to withhold a billion dollars.\u00a0 Contrast that with the President\u2019s \u2014 the transcript of the President\u2019s phone call with President Zelensky where there was no quid pro quo.\u00a0 There was no pressure.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s why most Americans want to get answers about what \u2014 what was going on.\u00a0 And to have Ukraine, particularly, as the President said, to get to the bottom of it.\u00a0 And I think that\u2019s what the American people would expect and anticipate.\nBut this administration is going to continue to advance the polices and the agenda we were elected to advance.\u00a0 That includes draining the swamp, and that includes demanding that our allies operate honest government in an upright way as well.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any indications that the administration is (inaudible) with Hispanic voters?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, let me say, we\u2019re going to be in and out of Arizona a lot, because we\u2019ve got a winning message.\u00a0 Hispanic Americans here in Arizona are winning under the policies of President Trump and the policies that Martha McSally supported and Governor Ducey has advanced in this state.\u00a0 I mean, our economy is growing.\u00a0 Our military is stronger than ever before.\nAnd let me also say that I think the values of this administration have stood for \u2014 of faith, and family, and the sanctity of life, and freedom \u2014 those are all values that are synonymous with the Hispanic American community.\u00a0 So we\u2019re going to come here, and we\u2019re going to talk about the progress that we\u2019ve made for security, for prosperity.\u00a0 But we\u2019re also going to speak about the values that Hispanic Americans cherish, that this President has championed.\u00a0 And I know we\u2019re going to bring home a great victory for Senator McSally and President Donald Trump in November of 2020.\nEND\n"

        "text": "First Baptist Church of Scottsdale\nScottsdale, Arizona\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, let me \u2014 let me welcome everyone here.\u00a0 And particularly, let me express my appreciation to Pastor Jim Coston of First Baptist.\u00a0 Thank you for the warm hospitality here at First Baptist Church.\nIt is great to be in Arizona.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be in Tucson a little bit later today.\u00a0 But it\u2019s a great privilege to be able to come here and to meet with so many leaders in the Hispanic Community here in Arizona and to have a conversation at the very outset of Hispanic Heritage Month.\nThank you all for coming.\u00a0 This is an exciting time in the life of the economy of Arizona and the economy of this nation.\nBut, as I\u2019ll reflect in a moment, it\u2019s also a very exciting time for the Hispanic American community.\u00a0 And we couldn\u2019t be more proud of it.\u00a0 Allow me to bring greetings from a great champion of Hispanic Americans and someone who\u2019s been fighting for jobs and opportunity and security for the Hispanic community and every community, President Donald Trump.\u00a0 We spoke this morning.\u00a0 I told him that I was going to see all of you, and he wanted me to convey his regards.\nI\u2019m also grateful to be joined today by two go- \u2014 counting three, actually \u2014 officials that I deeply respect: your great Governor, Doug Ducey, who was my friend since the time I was Governor of the state of Indiana.\u00a0 Governor, thank you for being here.\u00a0 Thank you for being \u2014\nGOVERNOR DUCEY:\u00a0 Thank you for being here.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 your great leadership in Arizona, and also for being such a great champion of the Hispanic community here in this state.\nSenator Martha McSally is also a very dear friend, and we served together in the House of Representatives.\u00a0 She is a tenacious advocate for our armed forces and for economic growth.\u00a0 The policies that the President and I have been able to advance would not have been possible without Senator McSally\u2019s strong, steadfast support during her tenure in the Congress and, now, her tenure in the United States Senate.\u00a0 So, thank you very much, Martha, for being here.\nAnd also, Jovita Carranza, my great friend, the Treasurer of the United States is with us today.\u00a0 We\u2019ll hear from each of these officials.\u00a0 But, Jovita, thank you so much for your great leadership \u2014\nTREASURER CARRANZA:\u00a0 Thank you for the invitation.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 for many years across this country and in this administration as our Treasurer.\nIt\u2019s Hispanic Heritage Month.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a time when, as a nation, we pause and we really celebrate the extraordinary contributions that Hispanic Americans have made to the life of this nation throughout our history.\nBut this is a particularly exciting time for Hispanic Americans, because thanks to the leadership of President Trump and our strong allies in the Congress \u2014 where we\u2019ve cut taxes, rolled back regulation on businesses large and small; where we\u2019ve been able to expand access to American energy \u2014 we\u2019ve launched an energy renaissance; it\u2019s contributing mightily to the economy of this state and this nation \u2014 our economy is booming.\u00a0 6.3 million new jobs created since Election Day 2016.\u00a0 We\u2019ve seen the stock market setting one record after another.\u00a0 That means real \u2014 real impacts for people\u2019s pensions and 401(k)s.\u00a0 And it makes a real difference for working families.\nBut also, the number of jobs that have been created, particularly in Hispanic American communities, is exciting.\u00a0 I have to tell you, for us, unemployment today is at a 50-year low. \u00a0But it is now \u2014 for 17 straight months, it is the lowest unemployment ever recorded for Hispanic Americans.\u00a0 And I can tell you personally, President Trump and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the entrepreneurship and ingenuity of the Hispanic American community here in Arizona and really, all over the country.\nI grabbed a few statistics on my way in: Unemployment in the Hispanic American community today is under 5 percent.\u00a0 That\u2019s 17 months in a row.\u00a0 But it had only gone under 5 percent for a single month in the last 43 years of the history of this country.\nI mean, the opportunity that we\u2019ve given every American to keep more of what you earned, for businesses to have more income, lower taxes, less red tape and regulations \u2014 it\u2019s been \u2014 it\u2019s been the Hispanic American community that has seized those opportunities in unique ways.\u00a0 And since Election Day, actually 2.4 million jobs have been created in the Hispanic American community alone.\nAnd \u2014 and maybe, even more importantly, to some of you all here, more than a million Hispanic women have entered the workforce.\u00a0 And, even the New York Times acknowledged \u2014 and this a quote \u2014 \u201cHispanic women have emerged as the biggest job market winners in [this] economy.\u201d\u00a0 And I know we\u2019ve got some great leaders in the community who will celebrate that just as much as we do.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nIn fact, according to a survey by Bank of America, three-quarters of Hispanic-owned small businesses expect their revenue to growth over the next year.\u00a0 And a majority of Hispanic-owned small businesses plan to hire more employees in the near future.\nSo, it\u2019s an exciting time in our economy.\nAnd, as we begin Hispanic Heritage Month, it\u2019s a particularly exciting time for jobs and opportunities for Hispanic Americans, not just in a growing state like Arizona, but really all across the country.\u00a0 And I\u2019m looking forward to talking with you today about how we can continue to build on that; how we can continue to create opportunities \u2014 not just for employment and economic growth, but how we can expand educational opportunities, how we can advance public safety and security in the Hispanic American community.\u00a0 And I\u2019m truly grateful that you all would come out and participate in this conversation.\nI\u2019m going to turn it over to the Governor.\u00a0 But let me say before the cameras slip away, that, as I said, standing alongside the President when we kicked off Hispanic Heritage Month last week: The contributions of Hispanic Americans to the life and the culture of this country are incalculable.\u00a0 And I truly do believe that this community represents all that\u2019s best about America \u2014 a belief in faith and freedom and hard work and the American Dream.\nAnd I just want to commit to each and every one of you that President Trump and I are going to continue to fight for the opportunities of Hispanic Americans and every American to live the American Dream.\u00a0 And I thank you so much for coming out today.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 Thank you.\nAnd, Governor Ducey, thank you for being here and we look forward to your remarks as well.\nGOVERNOR DUCEY:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I want to say thank you to the Vice President for choosing Arizona to come out and highlight Hispanic Heritage Month.\u00a0 I\u2019m very grateful for your leadership and for your friendship \u2014 our service together in the Governor\u2019s Conference, and the real work that you and President Trump are doing on behalf of our economy and growth in our nation.\u00a0 And I\u2019m happy that we can highlight it here today.\nWe\u2019ve got a great group of Hispanic leaders, decision-makers, and influencers here who are going to share with us what\u2019s happening in the community \u2014 ideas that we can bring back to the state house and to the federal government to further improve our economy.\nBut you are right, Mr. Vice President: Our economy is booming in the state of Arizona.\u00a0 We\u2019ve added 300,000 new jobs in our state alone since 2015.\u00a0 Arizona can brag as one of the fastest-growing states in the nation.\u00a0 Maricopa County is the fastest-growing county in the country.\u00a0 This is three years running.\u00a0 And Phoenix was just named the fastest-growing city in the country.\u00a0 So this is not on any small basis.\u00a0 This is 4.8 million people.\u00a0 This is larger than 26 other American states.\nSo we want to take advantage of this and reaffirm our commitment to the Hispanic community because it has been their involvement and contribution that has been such a driver in this success.\u00a0 Their relentless work ethic, their unwavering belief in our American Dream \u2014 this community has been integral to what\u2019s happening in our state.\nI think Arizona is a reflection of this.\u00a0 The art, the literature, the music, and the food reflect the values of this community and the flourishing business community brings it to life every day.\u00a0 The contributions of the Hispanic community is something for everyone in Arizona to be proud of and to celebrate.\nAnd, with 2019, came a very special milestone: the 60th anniversary of the Arizona-Mexico Commission, something that was founded by Governor Paul Fannin, who said, Mexico is our neighbor \u2014 \u201cGod made us neighbors, let us be good neighbors.\u201d\u00a0 And it\u2019s something we\u2019re very proud of.\u00a0 Our relationship today is as good as it has ever been.\nSo I\u2019m immensely proud of the hard work, dedication, and collaboration that it\u2019s take \u2014 taken for six decades of the Arizona-Mexico Commission.\u00a0 And with an economy that continues to boom, it comes as no surprise that the Hispanic community in our state and nation continues to grow.\nJust a couple, I think, key stats: In 2017, Latinos accounted for nearly one-quarter of entrepreneurs in the United States, despite being just 18 percent of the population.\u00a0 It shows the innovation that is so natural in this community.\u00a0 From 2000 to 2017, Arizona\u2019s Hispanic population grew 42 percent.\u00a0 Today, it\u2019s over 2.2 million people.\u00a0 And by 2022, Hispanic buying power in Arizona will surpass $57 billion.\nSo I want to thank you all for your commitment to Arizona and opening up opportunity in the Southwest.\u00a0 Arizona remains committed to working with our Hispanic community to accomplish these things that matter.\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Great job.\u00a0 Great job, Governor.\nGOVERNOR DUCEY:\u00a0 Thank you.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Senator?\nSENATOR MCSALLY:\u00a0 Mr. Vice President, welcome back to Arizona.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSENATOR MCSALLY:\u00a0 It\u2019s great to have you here and it\u2019s great to be with Governor Ducey and our leaders here representing the Hispanic community as we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month.\nIt\u2019s an absolute honor to represent the great state of Arizona in the United States Senate.\u00a0 And we are a very diverse state.\u00a0 And I have been spending my whole life fighting stereotypes \u2014 you know, making generalizations about, you know, groups of people \u2014 but the numbers certainly speak for themselves.\nWith the environment that we\u2019ve been able to create \u2014 with the policies, and rolling back regulations, and cutting taxes on small businesses \u2014 we now see Hispanic-owned businesses growing at an incredible rate.\u00a0 You know, between 2012 and 2018, Hispanic entrepreneurs and Hispanic-owned businesses grew by 40 percent across the country, while other businesses were growing at more like 18 to 20 percent.\nAnd I\u2019m particularly proud to see the growing number of female Hispanic entrepreneurs.\u00a0 You are the job creators.\u00a0 You are the ones that are getting up every day and making such a difference.\u00a0 The men are as well, but the growing number of female Hispanic-owned businesses is just incredible \u2014\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 It\u2019s amazing.\nSENATOR MCSALLY:\u00a0 \u2014 across the country and across our state.\nWe now \u2014 our population in Arizona is about 30 percent Hispanic and it\u2019s going to continue to grow.\nSo, you are making such a difference and it\u2019s an honor to be able to partner with all of you.\u00a0 And I really look forward to hearing your feedback today as we continue to work together to provide more opportunities for everybody, especially for Hispanic Arizonans.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you so much, Senator.\u00a0 Yeah.\nSENATOR MCSALLY:\u00a0 Yes, sir.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And thanks for all your great support that \u2014\nSENATOR MCSALLY:\u00a0 Absolutely.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 \u2014 that agenda.\nAnd I want to recognize the Treasurer of the United States.\u00a0 She\u2019s going to be traveling with me and with the Senator and the Governor down to Tucso- \u2014 Tucson, because we\u2019re talking about the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\u00a0 Because, for all the momentum that we have in this economy, President Trump and I are absolutely determined to call on this Congress to bring the USMCA to the floor and bring it to the floor this year.\u00a0 We believe it is a win for Arizona, it\u2019s a win for America, and we\u2019re going to be taking the case for the USMCA to Tucson a little bit later today.\nAnd I\u2019m personally grateful to have the Treasurer of the United States with us to help make that case.\nTREASURER CARRANZA:\u00a0 Thank you.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So, Jovita Carranza, thank you so much for your leadership, but thank you being here today and helping us support an agenda that\u2019s going to put even more momentum in this economy and more momentum in the Hispanic American community.\nTREASURER CARRANZA:\u00a0 Well, I\u2019d like to share with the group, and especially with you, Vice President Pence, and the Governor, for all the fine work that you\u2019re doing and the leadership that the Senator is providing.\nYou know, I\u2019m bringing it back home \u2014 you have about 6,000 SMEs that \u2014 in Arizona \u2014 that have provided about 20 billion dollars\u2019 worth of export, which is a phenomenal number, and about $1.7 million \u2014 billion of that is in agriculture.\nBut you\u2019re real strong sector is the IT sector, as well as \u2014 and when I say \u201cIT,\u201d it\u2019s computers and electronics.\u00a0 And the other is transportation \u2014 that of heavy equipment.\u00a0 I believe we\u2019re going to visit that in Tucson.\nSo, all that spells to one word \u2014 two words: job-growth prosperity.\u00a0 And so the more opportunities we have with the USMCA trade agreement \u2014 which is very beneficial, especially for low exports \u2014 low-revenue exports or value exports \u2014 less regulations and greater facilitation for trade.\nAnd any time we facilitate any type of commerce, it means job growth \u2014 immediate job growth, efficiencies for the private sector.\u00a0 And all that results into greater benefit strengths for the workforce, as you know.\nThe other point I wanted to make is that SMEs in Arizona \u2014 over 550,000 of them \u2014 represent 94 \u2014 I should say about 99.4 percent of your businesses, which is pretty \u2014 pretty strength \u2014 pretty strong.\u00a0 And that represents about 45 percent of the workforce in Arizona.\u00a0 So you have a great state.\u00a0 A lot of potential here for prosperity.\nAnd I have to reflect on one other number.\u00a0 The Hispanic community used to be the lowest number in any kind of reporting, and now it is the thriving number \u2014\nGOVERNOR DUCEY:\u00a0 Right.\nTREASURER CARRANZA:\u00a0 \u2014 and every principal in the government has been touting the growth in the Latina entrepreneurship sector, as well as high school graduation numbers are progressing.\u00a0 Even school debt is \u2014 been lower.\u00a0 And poverty levels in the Hispanic community has improved significantly.\nSo, we\u2019re driving some of these very strong numbers of prosperity in the United States, based on what the President has provided as retooling this economy for all Americans to prosper.\u00a0 So I thank you very much for this opportunity to share.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you, Jovita.\u00a0 Thank you for your great service to the country and we\u2019re looking very much forward to a conversation with each one of you about how we continue to build on that momentum.\nBut I can tell you the \u2014 I don\u2019t think the President or I ever miss an opportunity to brag on the incredible progress in the Hispanic American community.\u00a0 Lowest unemployment ever recorded for Hispanic Americans \u2014 now 17 months in a row, below 5 percent.\u00a0 It is a tribute to communities like you all represent here \u2014 states like Arizona.\nAnd I just want to \u2014 I just want to promise each and every one of you: We\u2019re going to continue to fight for those opportunities.\u00a0 Because that businessman who became President looks at all of that progress \u2014 6.3 million new jobs, record unemployment, 50-year low for every American \u2014 and he just calls that a good start.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nAnd so, Senator, get ready.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to keep going to create even better economic conditions and better opportunities.\u00a0 And really \u2014 and really do so in a way that will continue to see this Hispanic American community thrive, Arizona thrive.\u00a0 And I thank you all for being here for the conversation.\nThank you all.\nEND\n"

        "text": "South Lawn\n10:17 A.M. EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Hello, everybody.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to The Villages in Ocala, Florida.\u00a0 We have a big crowd.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to be talking about healthcare.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing a lot of work on healthcare.\u00a0 We\u2019re very successful at it.\u00a0 And so we\u2019re going to be speaking to the great people of Florida.\u00a0 And I think they\u2019re very happy with the job we\u2019re doing.\nYeah.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, first question, what did you \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What exactly, specifically, is inaccurate in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 What?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What exactly is inaccurate in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, if you look at the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, it\u2019s totally inaccurate because the conversation that I had was absolutely perfect.\u00a0 And most people that have read it say the same thing.\u00a0 The whistleblower never saw the \u2014 saw the conversation.\u00a0 He got his information, I guess, second- or third-hand.\u00a0 He wrote something that was total fiction.\u00a0 And now, when people see that, they\u2019re not happy.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you want to restrict investment flows into China and have Chinese stocks delisted?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re looking at a lot of different things.\u00a0 China is coming in next week.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have a meeting with them.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see.\u00a0 But we\u2019re doing very well.\nSome of the numbers, I think, are being affected by all of the nonsense, all of the politics going on in this country by the Democrats.\u00a0 I call them the \u201cDo-nothings.\u201d\u00a0 They do nothing for this country.\u00a0 They don\u2019t care about this country.\u00a0 But the numbers, really, are looking very good, going into the future.\nSo, we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 I have a lot of options on China.\u00a0 But if they don\u2019t do what we want, we have tremendous \u2014 tremendous power.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, what exactly did you hope Zelensky would do about the Bidens after your phone call?\u00a0 Exactly.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I would think that, if they were honest about it, they\u2019d start a major investigation into the Bidens.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very simple answer.\nThey should investigate the Bidens, because how does a company that\u2019s newly formed \u2014 and all these companies, if you look at \u2014\nAnd, by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with \u2014 with Ukraine.\nSo, I would say that President Zelensky \u2014 if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens.\u00a0 Because nobody has any doubt that they weren\u2019t crooked.\u00a0 That was a crooked deal \u2014 100 percent.\u00a0 He had no knowledge of energy; didn\u2019t know the first thing about it.\u00a0 All of a sudden, he is getting $50,000 a month, plus a lot of other things.\u00a0 Nobody has any doubt.\nAnd they got rid of a prosecutor who was a very tough prosecutor.\u00a0 They got rid of him.\u00a0 Now they\u2019re trying to make it the opposite way.\u00a0 But they got rid \u2014\nSo, if I were the President, I would certainly recommend that of Ukraine.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have you asked President Xi to investigate at all?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I haven\u2019t, but it\u2019s certainly something we can start thinking about.\u00a0 Because I\u2019m sure that President Xi does not like being under that kind of scrutiny, where billions of dollars is taken out his country by a guy that just got kicked out of the Navy.\u00a0 He got kicked out of the Navy; all of a sudden, he\u2019s getting billions of dollars.\u00a0 You know what they call that?\u00a0 They call that a \u201cpayoff.\u201d\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In your view, Mr. President \u2014 in your view, should the White House comply with any congressional subpoenas associated with the whistleblower complaint?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I leave that to the lawyers.\u00a0 I can say, though, that Schiff has now been proven to be a liar.\u00a0 We\u2019ve known it for three years, because they\u2019ve been trying to impeach for three years.\u00a0 He\u2019s a li- \u2014 he\u2019s a stone-cold liar.\u00a0 So I leave that to the lawyers. \u00a0That\u2019s up to them to decide.\u00a0 But the whole investigation is crumbling.\nYeah.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Can you still work with Congress to get other work done?\u00a0 Can you still work with Congress?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I can.\u00a0 Yeah, I can.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How can you do that?\u00a0 How?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You got \u2014 I \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, Pakistan is urging (inaudible) talks with the Taliban.\u00a0 Are you going to do that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we have a real problem.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been hitting the Taliban very, very hard.\u00a0 And, as far as I\u2019m concerned, they still haven\u2019t recovered from killing 12 people \u2014 one of \u2014 happened to be a great American solider from Puerto Rico.\u00a0 They still have not recovered, and they probably never will.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014 President Trump, what is McConnell \u2014 what is McConnell telling you about impeachment?\u00a0 Has he assured you that Senate Republicans won\u2019t vote for it?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 No, but I read Mitch McConnell\u2019s statement yesterday, and he read my phone call.\u00a0 And, as you know, he put out a statement that said that was the most innocent phone call he\u2019s read.\u00a0 And I spoke to him about it, too.\nHe read my phone call with the President of Ukraine.\u00a0 Mitch McConnell \u2014 he said, \u201cThat was the most innocent phone call that I\u2019ve read.\u201d\u00a0 I mean, give me a break.\u00a0 Anybody that reads it says the same thing.\u00a0 And the only people that don\u2019t understand it is when they look at the false, fabricated, fraudulent statement made by Shifty Schiff.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, Vice President Biden \u2014 Vice President Biden said that he\u2019s not going anywhere.\u00a0 He has said that you\u2019re not going to destroy his family.\u00a0 What do \u2014 what\u2019s your response?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I think Biden is going down.\u00a0 And I think his whole situation \u2014 because now you may very well find that there are many other countries that they scammed, just like they scammed China and Ukraine.\u00a0 And basically, who are they really scamming?\u00a0 The USA.\u00a0 And it\u2019s not good.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He said he was carrying out the official policy \u2014\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And that\u2019s probably why China, for so many years, has had a sweetheart deal where China rips off the USA \u2014 because they deal like people with Biden, where they give their son a billion and a half dollars.\u00a0 And that\u2019s probably why China has such a sweetheart deal that, for so many years, they\u2019ve been ripping off our country.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you support SB-206 \u2014 the college athletes getting paid?\u00a0 Or do you side with the NCAA and the schools?\u00a0\u00a0 And do you think this should be a federal law?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We\u2019re looking at it.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking at very closely.\u00a0 It\u2019s under study.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Has North Korea gone too far this time with the ballistic missile?\u00a0 Is that too far?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 We\u2019ll see.\u00a0 They want to talk, and we\u2019ll be talking to them soon.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see.\nSo I\u2019m going to \u2014 yes?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, why did recall the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine?\u00a0 Was she a problem?\u00a0 Why did you recall her?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 I heard very bad things about her.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t know if I recalled her or somebody recalled her, but I heard very, very bad things about her for a long period of time.\u00a0 Not good.\nThank you.\u00a0 I\u2019ll see you in Florida.\u00a0 I\u2019ll see you all in Florida.\nEND\n10:24 A.M.

EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Look at all the press that you attract.\u00a0 Do you believe this?\u00a0 That\u2019s very impressive.\nPRESIDENT NIINIST\u00d6:\u00a0 I guess they are not after me.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I hope not.\u00a0 You\u2019re lucky.\nThank you very much.\u00a0 Today, it\u2019s my honor to welcome President Niinist\u00f6 of Finland to the White House.\u00a0\u00a0 And, Mr. President, it\u2019s wonderful to host you once again in Washington.\u00a0 We\u2019ve gotten to know each other over the last period of time, and it\u2019s been \u2014 it\u2019s been a great experience.\nThe President and I have just concluded very productive discussions on a number of exciting opportunities for our two nations.\nBefore going further, I want to express our deep condolences over the horrific stabbing attack that took place yesterday at a college in Finland.\u00a0 America is praying for the victims and their families, and we send our unwavering love and support.\nPRESIDENT NIINIST\u00d6:\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 The American and Finnish people are linked by an abiding commitment to self-government, individual rights, democracy, and the rule of law.\u00a0 This past May, our countries celebrated the 100th anniversary of America\u2019s recognition of the independent nation of Finland in 1919.\u00a0 As President Wilson wrote at the time, our recognition was \u201cprompted by [the] sympathies for a cause similar to that which caused our own declaration of independence in 1776.\u201d\nA century after we established diplomatic relations, the United States and Finland remain united by those same cherished values.\nCentral to this effort is our nations\u2019 close cooperation on matters of security and defense.\u00a0 Although Finland is not a member of NATO \u2014 you save a lot of money \u2014 Finland participates in many NATO missions and exercises.\u00a0 And I\u2019m pleased that Finland is substantially increasing its military budget.\nAmerica and Finland are also working together to advance stability, freedom of navigation, and respect for national sovereignty in the Arctic.\u00a0 Both of our nations are committed to a secure Arctic region \u2014 free from external intrusion, interference, and coercion.\u00a0 Simply put, we believe that the affairs of the Arctic should be governed by the actual nations of the Arctic.\u00a0 And, as you know, there are other people coming into the Arctic, and we don\u2019t like it.\u00a0 And we can\u2019t let it happen, and we won\u2019t let it happen.\nThe United States and Finland are likewise partnering to ensure the security of 5G networks.\u00a0 It is critical that we use safe and trustworthy technology providers, components, and supply chains.\u00a0 We welcome the establishment of the UROS Innovation Center in Finland.\u00a0 Qualcomm has done a fantastic job with that.\u00a0 This Innovation Center will greatly expand American and Finnish businesses and cooperation in 5G.\nWe\u2019re also glad that the Finnish company, Nokia \u2014 it\u2019s a great company \u2014 a global leader in 5G technology, is developing its cutting-edge products right here in the United States at Bell Labs in New Jersey.\nAcross the United States, foreign direct investment from Finland totals over $10 billion.\u00a0 Each year, Finnish-owned companies invest more than $120 million in research and development in America, and expand our exports by more than $1 billion.\nJust today, Finnish Nokian Tyres opened a new manufacturing plant in Dayton, Tennessee \u2014 a $360 million investment that is creating hundreds of brand new, beautiful jobs for a great state: Tennessee.\u00a0 We love Tennessee.\u00a0 So, they made a wise choice.\u00a0 You never lose when you go to Tennessee.\nI encourage other Finnish companies to increase their investments in the United States.\u00a0 There has simply never been a better time to do business in America.\u00a0 We have passed the largest tax cuts and reform, and also regulation cuts, in the history of country.\u00a0 We slashed business tax.\u00a0 And we\u2019re fueling job growth through our record-setting campaign to abolish all of those really terrible, unnecessary regulations.\u00a0 We have plenty of regulations, but many of them we didn\u2019t need, and we got rid of them.\nThe American economy is booming, wages are rising, incomes are soaring, and unemployment has hit its lowest level in more than half a century.\u00a0 We want Finnish companies to join in America\u2019s extraordinary economic revival.\u00a0 So many countries are coming in.\u00a0 It\u2019s the hot place.\u00a0 We have the hottest economy in the world, and it\u2019s the hot place to be.\u00a0 They all want to be here.\nThe President and I are also working on a way to improve international trade based on the principle of fairness and \u2014 my favorite word \u2014 reciprocity.\u00a0 I hope that Finland, which now holds the rotating presidency of the EU Council, will support our efforts to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement with the European Union.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have to start doing something with the European Union because they have not been treating this country right for many, many years.\u00a0 And they know it.\u00a0 And I tell them, and they know it.\nAmerica\u2019s trade deficit with the EU has been averaging $160 billion a year for many, many years.\u00a0\u00a0 Achieving more balanced and robust trade flows would greatly benefit both Finland and the United States.\u00a0 We also appreciate Finland\u2019s strong partnership in combatting predatory trade practices worldwide, including the theft of intellectual property.\nFrom trade to security, from travel to commerce, we are immensely grateful for our close and deeply valued friendship with the people of Finland.\u00a0 Great people.\u00a0 And we\u2019re now working on a deal to sell a large number of airplanes, fighter jets \u2014 hopefully to Finland.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see how that works out.\u00a0 But we make the greatest jets in the world.\u00a0 We make the greatest missiles and military equipment anywhere in the world.\u00a0 Nobody is even close.\nMr. President, I want to thank you again for visiting the White House.\u00a0 The history of our two nations is a profound testament to the importance of our independence and resolve to defend it.\u00a0 I look forward to continuing to work alongside of you as we safeguard our precious sovereignty and build a bright future of hope, harmony, and peace for the American and Finnish people.\nAnd thank you very much for being with us at the White House and the Oval Office.\u00a0 We had a very special number of hours.\u00a0 Appreciate it very much.\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\nPRESIDENT NIINIST\u00d6:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 First of all, I will deliver your condolences to \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Please.\nPRESIDENT NIINIST\u00d6:\u00a0 \u2014 Finnish people.\u00a0 They do appreciate that.\u00a0 Thank you.\nLadies and gentlemen, before meeting, I had some spare time, so I visited a couple of museums here \u2014 Museum of American History, Museum of American African History, and Museum of American Indian History.\u00a0 And in addition to that, I had a possibility of attending ceremony in Arlington.\nMr. President, you have here a great democracy.\u00a0 Keep it going on.\u00a0 We were \u2014 we had a very good discussion with the President.\u00a0 Like you mentioned, our diplomatic relations are 100 years old.\u00a0 During that time, we have developed our cooperation a lot, not only in official meetings like this, but American and Finnish people, scientists, for example, need each other cooperating, working together.\nWe have quite a lot of cooperation in security sector, also in defense, because I think that we share the feeling that the most important thing for the nation is to guarantee security to its citizens.\u00a0 And that is the starting point for Finland, also, to this cooperation.\nI wanted to take up with the President the importance of transatlantic cooperation.\u00a0 Well, we all know Europe needs USA.\u00a0 But I say that USA needs also Europe.\u00a0 We know the price of everything.\u00a0 We should recognize also the value of everything.\u00a0 We share the same values: democracy, human rights, rule-based order.\u00a0 And in that, we are very similar.\nEurope has, in a way, awakened during the couple last years to understand also more about security point of view.\u00a0 And I just want to tell you that, in my opinion, the stronger Europe you have, the stronger partner you have.\nThe Arctic area \u2014 you know Finland is in very north \u2014 is becoming more and more interesting, like the President said.\u00a0 We both, alongside with six countries, form the Arctic Council.\u00a0 And we are working heavily.\u00a0 There are, surely, possibilities.\u00a0 Like we have heard, the maritime routes are being opened.\u00a0 Maybe there are also resources, but there are huge risks.\u00a0 One of them is that we should keep the low tension we are used to have there.\u00a0 And that is what we have been discussing, and I do appreciate President\u2019s position to emphasize that.\u00a0 It is not a place for military.\nBut an even greater challenge is the environment, and I\u2019m very glad that we started to talk two years ago in this very house about black coal.\u00a0 It is not, maybe, the worst which causes climate problems, but it is \u2014 everybody can understand that if black comes down to ice and to snow, when the sun meets it, it melts down.\u00a0 And melting of sea ice in Arctic is very crucial.\u00a0 I used to say that if we lose the Arctic, we lose the globe.\nWe had a couple of words \u2014 very important ones \u2013 on arms control.\u00a0 We \u2014 some of us remember the worst years of Cold War in 1960s.\u00a0 There was no agreement at all.\u00a0 Just Cold War.\u00a0 We can\u2019t let the situation return no agreement at all about arms control.\u00a0 And that is why it is important to try to negotiate new agreements and to continue the New START Agreement.\u00a0 That will be a good new start for international cooperation on that.\nTo end up with \u2014 you, Mr. President, referred to 5G, the EU use of ICT as a whole.\u00a0 We are very proud to have the excellence of \u2014 the Centre of Excellence of Hybrid in Helsinki.\u00a0 The USA has been very helpful in that.\u00a0 Very many countries are working there together to fight against the future danger of hybrid warfare.\nWhen comes to providers in that area, I am not very willing to point out any country or company here now.\u00a0 It may be a bit late from USA, in EU, making a risk assessment.\u00a0 It will be prepared in one, two weeks\u2019 time.\u00a0 And after that, we are in a place that we have to choose the tools to protect us.\nMr. President, I want to thank you very much for having a possibility of meeting you here.\u00a0 It is very valuable, and I found our discussions very open, very interesting, and giving a lot to my little country.\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Thank you.\nBefore we take questions, something happened that\u2019s been \u2014 it\u2019s been going on for many decades and we came to a conclusion.\u00a0 Could I ask Ambassador Pence to just come up for one second and explain the importance of what just took place?\u00a0 Because this has been going on for \u2014\nPRESIDENT NIINIST\u00d6:\u00a0 Wonderful.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 \u2014 many, many years.\u00a0 And this is Ambassador Pence.\u00a0 No relationship to our great Vice President.\u00a0 Hard to believe.\u00a0 Nobody believes that, but that\u2019s true.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT NIINIST\u00d6:\u00a0 (Inaudible) one.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Right?\nAMBASSADOR PENCE:\u00a0 But I have been introduced as his father, his brother, his cousin, and his uncle.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 We are friends.\nGood afternoon.\u00a0 When I arrived in Helsinki about a year and a half ago, there were stack of papers on the desk, one of a couple of which concerned indigenous peoples from the southwestern United States \u2014 Arizona, Colorado \u2014 including probably most predominantly, but generically I will refer to them as Hopi Indians.\u00a0 They were one of the group.\u00a0 In 1895, a lot of their remains had been excavated and removed along with about 500 artifacts to Finland.\u00a0 And there they\u2019ve remained despite a lot of activity to get them back.\nAnd I\u2019ll just jump to the end and say: Through the good offices of our State Department, but in particular, President Niinist\u00f6 and his entire team, we\u2019ve secured a mutual agreement whereby all of those remains, including a number of petrified bodies, will be going back to be put back where they were buried.\nSo it\u2019s special to us, and I think it\u2019s probably special to indigenous peoples everywhere around the globe that we\u2019re all concerned about paying appropriate respect to those who have departed before us.\u00a0 So, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you both of the Presidents for supporting this.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Fantastic job.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Be careful.\nThank you.\u00a0 That\u2019s a great job, Mr. Ambassador.\u00a0 That\u2019s been going on for many, many decades.\u00a0 So, I just want to thank you.\u00a0 Outstanding.\nJohn Roberts?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, thank you.\u00a0 President Niinist\u00f6.\u00a0 If I could, sir, I\u2019ve got two pertinent questions to ask you.\u00a0 Maybe I could ask them separately to get a fresh answer out of each one.\nThe three House Intelligence \u2014 the three House committees that are looking into the impeachment inquiry gave notice today that they will be sending a subpoena to the White House for documents and other materials.\u00a0 Will you cooperate with those subpoenas?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I always cooperate.\u00a0 This is a hoax.\u00a0 This is the greatest hoax.\u00a0 This is just a continuation of what\u2019s been playing out, John, for the last \u2014 since my election, I would say.\u00a0 If you wanted \u2014 probably, we\u2019ll find out soon, but probably even before my election.\nThis is a fraudulent crime on the American people.\u00a0 But we\u2019ll work together with Shifty Schifft [sic] and Pelosi and all of them, and we\u2019ll see what happens, because we did absolutely \u2014 I had a great call with the President of Ukraine.\u00a0 It was 100 percent.\u00a0 You have the transcript.\nAnd then, Schiff went up and he got \u2014 as the chairman of the committee, he got up and related a call that didn\u2019t take place.\u00a0 He made up the language.\u00a0 Hard to believe.\u00a0 Nobody has ever seen this.\u00a0 I think he had some kind of a mental breakdown.\nBut he went up to the microphone and he read a statement from the President of the United States as if I were on the call, because what happened is, when he looked at the sheet \u2014 which was an exact transcript of my call, done by very talented people that do this \u2014 exact, word for word \u2014 he said, \u201cWow, he didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d\u00a0 So he made it up. \u00a0He went up to a microphone, and, in front of the American people and in Congress, he went out and he gave a whole presentation of words that the President of the United States never said.\u00a0 It has to be a criminal act.\u00a0 It has to be.\u00a0 And he should resign. \u00a0And some people even say it was treason.\u00a0 But it was a very sad thing.\nAnd just so you know, the call was perfect \u2014 the real call; the call I made.\u00a0 Many people were on the line.\u00a0 I knew that because, usually, when I speak to foreign country leaders \u2014 you can name any one of them \u2014 but when I speak on the phone, I know that we have many people listening from various intelligence agencies.\u00a0 My knowledge \u2014 I know all about it.\u00a0 And so this isn\u2019t something like, \u201cOh, gee, I\u2019m on the line.\u00a0 Let\u2019s talk about a big secret.\u201d\u00a0 This is many people on the line.\u00a0 I don\u2019t even know how many.\u00a0 We\u2019ll find out, I guess.\u00a0 But many people.\u00a0 Mike Pompeo was on the line.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t say anything.\u00a0 He just \u2014 because they listen for both knowledge and for security reasons and for lots of reasons.\nBut the President of Ukraine, at the United Nations the other day \u2014 and previous to that \u2014 he announced through his spokesperson \u2014 said there was absolutely no pressure put on him.\u00a0 There was no quid pro quo, at all.\u00a0 And if you look at this whistleblower\u2019s \u2014 which I have a lot of respect for whistleblowers, but only when they\u2019re real \u2014 his report of the phone call was totally different than the fact.\nBut what got them was they never thought I was going to release the call.\u00a0 Because I don\u2019t like doing that.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to do it.\u00a0 I hope I don\u2019t have to do it again \u2014 release phone calls to foreign dignitaries, to foreign leaders.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to do that, John.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to do it again.\u00a0 But I did it with the permission of the Ukrainian government.\u00a0 We got permission.\u00a0 We called up their representatives and asked them, \u201cWould it be okay?\u201d\u00a0 Otherwise, I couldn\u2019t have done it.\nAnd if I wouldn\u2019t have done it, I would have been exposed to a lie, because the whistleblower report \u2014 didn\u2019t he say, seven or eight times, I said \u201cquid pro quo\u201d?\u00a0 In other words, \u201cYou\u2019re going to do this or you\u2019re not going to get money.\u201d\nNow, in all fairness \u2014 Biden said it, and he\u2019s on tape.\u00a0 In all fairness, you have at least four United States senators \u2014 Democrats \u2014 that said it.\u00a0 And they said it a lot stronger than even Schiff and his made-up story said it.\nObama, when he was dealing with the President of Russia \u2014 not Putin \u2014 he said, \u201cHey, tell Vladimir I can do a lot more after the election.\u201d\u00a0 You remember that?\u00a0 You didn\u2019t make a big deal out of that.\u00a0 Everybody thought, \u201cOh, isn\u2019t that cute?\u00a0 Isn\u2019t that cute?\u201d\u00a0 My talk and my response \u2014 Lindsey Graham said, \u201cI never knew you were that nice.\u00a0 I can\u2019t believe you were that nice.\u201d \u00a0He said that loud and clear.\u00a0 It was perfect.\u00a0 It was perfect.\u00a0 Not a thing wrong with it.\nTo impeach a President over a fraud that was committed by other people that want to win an election in 2020 \u2014 which they won\u2019t \u2014 is incredible.\u00a0 This is the greatest hoax.\u00a0 Now, it\u2019s gone on for a long time.\u00a0 We had the Mueller collusion delusion, okay?\u00a0 That went on for years.\u00a0 And that\u2019s finally done.\u00a0 No collusion, no obstruction, no nothing.\u00a0 It was a joke, and everyone knows it.\u00a0 And it was from the day one.\u00a0 Now I get three days of peace, and I\u2019m walking into the United Nations, going to meet with the biggest leaders in the world, and I hear about the word \u201cimpeachment.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhat did I do now?\u201d\u00a0 And it was about a beautiful conversation that I had.\nAnd just remember this: The Ukrainian new President, a fine man, said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u00a0 There was no pressure.\u201d\u00a0 And he said it a number of times.\nOkay, what\u2019s your second question?\u00a0 Well, you shouldn\u2019t be asking two questions.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, you\u2019re going to want to answer them.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Do me a favor: Ask one of the Finnish \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I will.\u00a0 But I think you\u2019ll want \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 John.\u00a0 John.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think you\u2019ll want to ask \u2014 answer this question, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 John, ask one of the Finnish President.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And then can I come back to you?\u00a0 Because I think you\u2019ll want to answer this.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 We\u2019ll talk later.\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 Well, it sounds like it might be a good question.\u00a0 Let me see if I like the question.\u00a0 Go ahead.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Maybe for the first time in three years, I\u2019ll have a good question, and I\u2019ll love it.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is a report that came out just before you and President Niinist\u00f6 walked out here that the whistleblower met with a staff member of Adam Schiff, prior to \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Oh, I love that question.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 the complaint being filed.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 It shows that Schiff is a fraud.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I love that question.\u00a0 Thank you, John.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So can I finish asking it?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 There\u2019s nothing to finish.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So the whistleblower, according to this report, met with a member of staff \u2014 of Adam Schiff\u2019s staff.\u00a0 You\u2019ve got it right there.\u00a0 You know it.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I hate to say it\u2019s the New York Times.\u00a0 I can\u2019t believe they wrote it.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Your response to the fact that \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Maybe they\u2019re getting better.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Your response to the fact that that happened and that Schiff may have learned some of what the whistleblower knew prior to the complaint being filed?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I think it\u2019s a scandal that he knew before.\u00a0 I\u2019d go a step further: I think he\u2019s probably helped write it.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 That\u2019s what the word is.\u00a0 And I think it\u2019s \u2014 I give a lot of respect for the New York Times for putting it out.\nIt just happened.\u00a0 As I\u2019m walking up here, they handed it to me.\u00a0 And I said to Mike \u2014 I said, \u201cWhoa, that\u2019s something.\u00a0 That\u2019s big stuff.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s a big story.\u00a0 He knew long before, and he helped write it, too.\u00a0 It\u2019s a scam.\u00a0 It\u2019s a scam.\nJust to finish on this \u2014 I appreciate it.\u00a0 I love that second question, by the way.\u00a0 Should have asked it first.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But \u2014 but, let me just tell you: The whole thing is a scam.\u00a0 The Mueller deal was a scam.\u00a0 The Russian collusion was a scam.\u00a0 You can ask Putin.\u00a0 Nobody has been rougher on Russia than Donald Trump, okay?\nNow, with that being said, it would be great to get along with Russia.\u00a0 And we will get along with Russia, because it\u2019s smart.\u00a0 But nobody has been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump.\nOkay.\u00a0 Ask one, please.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 President Niinist\u00f6, good to see you again.\u00a0 You had a conversation with President Trump about 5G, and how Nokia, Finland\u2019s big company, could fill in that space.\u00a0 You also met with Chinese President Xi during the summer, in which you renewed the ties of friendship between the two nations.\u00a0 Do you believe that countries, particularly western countries, that put Huawei equipment in their 5G cores are at risk of national security?\nPRESIDENT NIINIST\u00d6:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Like I told you already: In Europe, the situation is maybe a bit different from that here, because the main company you mentioned is inside Europe \u2014 partly, at least.\nWhat European Union is now doing is making a risk assessment, asking each country what kind of experience, what kind of \u2014 what you have seen and found out.\u00a0 And that will be well-finished in week two \u2014 or two weeks\u2019 time.\u00a0 And after that, we have to decide together, in European Union, which kind of tools we need to protect ourselves.\nYou referred to my discussions with President Xi.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t talk about 5G while meeting.\u00a0 And we all know Nokia is a major factor in this area.\u00a0 They will answer for themselves.\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yeah, please.\u00a0 Pick somebody who is really nice from Finland.\nPRESIDENT NIINIST\u00d6:\u00a0 No more Finnish \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Do you have a really nice person?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 Finnish \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I think they\u2019re all nice in Finland.\nPRESIDENT NIINIST\u00d6:\u00a0 Are there Finnish reporters?\u00a0 Just two.\u00a0 Okay.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Uh oh.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hi.\nPRESIDENT NIINIST\u00d6:\u00a0 Did I \u2014 wait a minute.\u00a0 Yes?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m Mari Karppinen from MTV News Finland and I have one question for President Trump and one question for President Niinist\u00f6.\u00a0 First, Mr. Trump, how will this political storm affect U.S. foreign policy, especially its relationship with Finland?\nAnd second, for President Niinist\u00f6 \u2014 because this is the biggest issue here at the moment, I have to ask: What kind of favors has Mr. Trump asked from you?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Or the other way around, you mean?\nPRESIDENT NIINIST\u00d6:\u00a0 What favors I asked or was asked?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I think you mean the other way around.\nPRESIDENT NIINIST\u00d6:\u00a0 Both ways.\u00a0 Okay.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 So the political storm \u2014 I\u2019ve lived with it from the day I got elected.\u00a0 I\u2019ve done more \u2014 and this administration has done more than any administration in the history of this country in the first two and a half years.\u00a0 I\u2019m used to it.\u00a0 For me, it\u2019s like putting on a suit in the morning.\nPeople have said to me, \u201cHow does he handle it?\u201d\u00a0 Rush Limbaugh said, \u201cI don\u2019t know of any man in America that could handle it.\u201d\u00a0 Sean Hannity said the same thing.\u00a0 Others have said the same thing, \u201cI don\u2019t know any man in America\u2026\u201d\u00a0 Because it\u2019s all a fraud.\nAnd because of that, and because I know that I\u2019m right, and because I\u2019m doing a great job for the American people, I\u2019m very, very happy living the way I\u2019m living.\u00a0 I thought that I would finish off the first term without the threat of people making false claims, but this one turned out to be incredible.\u00a0 All because they didn\u2019t know that I had a transcript done by very, very talented people \u2014 word for word, comma for comma.\u00a0 Done by people that do it for a living.\u00a0 We had an exact transcript.\u00a0 And when we produced that transcript, they died.\u00a0 Because you look at the whistleblower statement, and it\u2019s vicious.\u00a0 Vicious.\u00a0 And that whistleblower, there\u2019s no question in my mind that some bad things have gone on, and I think we\u2019ll get to the bottom of it.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s going to be a total reversal.\nBut I\u2019ve lived with this.\u00a0 I\u2019ve lived with this cloud now for almost three years \u2014 more than that, because it probably started even before.\u00a0 And I think nobody has done what I\u2019ve done when you look at tax cuts and regulation cuts, and rebuilding our military, and Right to Try.\u00a0 Right to Try.\u00a0 That means people that are terminally ill and very sick have the right to use our medicines \u2014 our great medicines \u2014 because we\u2019re so far ahead of every other country.\nSo many things that we\u2019ve done.\u00a0 Our vets are now taking care of.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got Choice.\u00a0 Nobody thought we could ever get Choice.\u00a0 That\u2019s when you have to wait on line as a vet.\u00a0 You go outside, you get a doctor, we pay the bill.\u00a0 You don\u2019t have to wait for three weeks to see a doctor if you\u2019re a vet.\u00a0 We cherish our vets \u2014 at least this administration does.\u00a0 But for many years, they didn\u2019t.\u00a0 But I take care of the vets.\nNo administration has done \u2014 and I\u2019ve lived with it from the day I got elected, so I\u2019m just fine with it.\u00a0 Okay?\nPRESIDENT NIINIST\u00d6:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 We had a conversation and discussion on a very equal basis, which is, I really appreciate that.\nWell, I had one request specifically.\u00a0 I wanted the President to take more notice on transatlantic relations because I consider it\u2019s useful both for USA and Europe.\nWhile we were discussing also trading, I told the President that the big purchase we are doing on fighters will be finished in two years\u2019 time.\u00a0 We have five different candidates: three from Europe and two from United States.\u00a0 He answered that, \u201cOurs is best.\u201d\u00a0 (Laughs.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Jeff, go ahead.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\u00a0 Jeff Mason from Reuters.\u00a0 Mr. President, I\u2019d like to ask you about your use of the word \u201ctreason.\u201d\u00a0 You used it repeatedly in the last few days.\u00a0 Do you consider anyone who opposes you treasonous?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 No.\u00a0 I consider when they lie; when they stand before our great body in our great chamber, and they make up a story that\u2019s fiction, like Schiff did.\u00a0 He took that perfect conversation I had with the Ukrainian President, and he made it into a total lie.\u00a0 It was a total fabrication.\u00a0 And you do admit that.\u00a0 It was a total fabrication.\nHe said, \u201cThis is what\u2026\u201d \u2014 and the only ones that don\u2019t like my conversation are the ones that never read it.\u00a0 But they heard Shifty Schiff.\u00a0 That\u2019s what I call a lie.\u00a0 And because of the fact that he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s lying about the President of the United States and as to what the President says \u2014 you know, I \u2014 believe it or not, I watch my words very carefully.\u00a0 There are those that think I\u2019m a very stable genius.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 I watch my words very, very closely.\u00a0 And to have somebody get up and to totally fabricate a conversation that I had with another leader and make it sound so bad \u2014 it was so evil.\u00a0 And now I see this that just came out minutes ago, where he met at a time that was impossible to have done unless there\u2019s corruption involved.\nAnd just so you know, we\u2019ve been investigating, on a personal basis \u2014 through Rudy and others, lawyers \u2014 corruption in the 2016 election.\u00a0 We\u2019ve been investigating corruption, because I probably will \u2014 I was going to definitely \u2014 but I probably will be bringing a lot of litigation against a lot of people having to do with the corrupt investigation, having to do with the 2016 election.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For example?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 And I have every right to do that.\u00a0 Because the way they\u2019ve treated me and other people \u2014 they\u2019ve destroyed people.\u00a0 They\u2019ve destroyed their lives with a phony charge that never existed.\u00a0 And that was collusion.\u00a0 Never existed.\u00a0 And you had 18 people that hated Donald Trump.\u00a0 And you had Bob Mueller that hated Donald Trump.\u00a0 And in the end, they couldn\u2019t find one damn thing.\u00a0 I could find it on you.\u00a0 They couldn\u2019t find one thing about Donald Trump having to do with collusion.\u00a0 This is after two years and spending $42 million.\nAnd I\u2019ve been looking at that long and hard for a long period of time \u2014 how it started, why it started.\u00a0 It should never happen to another President ever.\u00a0 But I\u2019ve been talking about it from the standpoint of bringing a major lawsuit, and I\u2019ve been talking about it for a long time.\nWe\u2019ve been investigating the corruption, having to do with what they did to my people.\u00a0 They destroyed many of peop- \u2014 many people.\u00a0 They came down to Washington to do a great job, and they left home.\u00a0 They left Washington dark.\u00a0 They were dark.\u00a0 They came down here, I say, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.\u00a0 They wanted to do a great job for the people.\u00a0 They wanted to do a great job.\u00a0 We won the election.\u00a0 And then, they get served with subpoenas.\u00a0 All these subpoenas.\nNow, look at Nancy Pelosi.\u00a0 Nancy Pelosi hands out subpoenas like \u2014 you know, she has to approve it.\u00a0 She hands out subpoenas like they\u2019re cookies.\u00a0 \u201cYou want a subpoena?\u00a0 Here you go.\u00a0 Take them.\u201d\u00a0 Like they\u2019re cookies.\u00a0 Paul Ryan would never give anybody a subpoena.\u00a0 He wouldn\u2019t give them when Mark Meadows went in to talk.\u00a0 He wouldn\u2019t give them when Jim Jordan went in.\u00a0 When Devin Nunes \u2014 he would go in, and they\u2019d see Paul.\u00a0 I\u2019m not saying wrong or right, but Paul Ryan: \u201cNo, let\u2019s talk about it.\u00a0 That\u2019s a big thing, to give a subpoena.\u00a0 Let\u2019s talk about it.\u201d\u00a0 Two weeks later, they\u2019re still talking.\u00a0 They wanted subpoenas to investigate the corrupt Democrats and the corrupt people on the other side.\u00a0 Paul Ryan would not give subpoenas.\nNancy Pelosi?\u00a0 \u201cHere you go.\u00a0 Take it.\u00a0 Who wants a subpoena?\u201d\u00a0 Every day, you get subpoenas.\u00a0 And Paul Ryan was actually right, probably, because they should never, ever allow a thing like this to happen to our country again.\nThank you very much.\u00a0 Please.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, can you just make clear, right here: What do you or what did you want President Zelensky to do with regard to Joe and Hunter Biden?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 If you look at what he said \u2014 okay?\u00a0 And he brought it up.\u00a0 I think he brought up the name, \u201cRudy Giuliani.\u201d\u00a0 What I want is the following: And I\u2019ve said this loud and clear.\u00a0 We have our ambassadors here.\u00a0 We have Mike Pence here.\u00a0 Why are we the only ones that give the big money to the Ukraine?\nWe give money to Ukraine, and it\u2019s bothered me from day one.\u00a0 And you have plenty of people \u2014 just here.\u00a0 I say, \u201cHow come it\u2019s always the United States that gets ripped?\u201d\u00a0 Frankly, Ukraine \u2014 we want to help them.\u00a0 And I do like the new President.\u00a0 You know why I like him?\u00a0 Because he was honest, because he said, \u201cThere was no pressure at all exerted on me\u201d \u2014 meaning him \u2014 \u201cby the President of the United States.\u201d\u00a0 He said it.\u00a0 By the way, that one sentence should stop this.\u00a0 But he said there was no pressure exerted.\nBut you don\u2019t have to ask him; all you have to do is read the transcript.\u00a0 Read the telephone call.\nBut what I was having a problem with are two things.\u00a0 Number one, Ukraine is known \u2014 before him \u2014 for tremendous corruption.\u00a0 Tremendous.\u00a0 More than just about any country in the world.\u00a0 In fact, they\u2019re rated one of the most corrupt countries in the world.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t like giving money to a country that\u2019s that corrupt.\nNumber two, I said \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You don\u2019t like giving money?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Excuse me.\u00a0 Number two, I said the following \u2014 and I said this loud and clear to everybody.\u00a0 And, in fact, Rob Portman backed me up, and there\u2019s nobody more honorable than Rob Portman of Ohio.\u00a0 Because he called up: \u201cPlease, let the money go.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cRob, I hate being the country that\u2019s always giving money when Ukraine helps Europe and the European countries far more than they help us.\u201d\u00a0 They\u2019re like a wall between Russia and Europe.\u00a0 They\u2019re like a wall.\u00a0 They\u2019re a big, wide, beautiful wall.\nAnd he said, \u201cYou know what?\u00a0 But it\u2019s important.\u201d\u00a0 And he \u2014 in fact, he came out and he said that.\u00a0 That was my only reason.\u00a0 Because I don\u2019t like being the sucker country.\u00a0 We were the sucker country for years and years.\u00a0 We\u2019re not the sucker country anymore.\nBut I gave the money because Rob Portman and others called me and asked.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t like to be the sucker.\u00a0 And European countries are helped far more than we are, and those countries should pay more to help Ukraine.\nGo ahead.\u00a0 Ask a question, please.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\u00a0 Mr. \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What about Biden?\u00a0 What about Mr. Biden?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What did you want about Biden?\u00a0 What did you want him to look into on Biden?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: \u00a0Look, Biden and his son are stone-cold crooked.\u00a0 And you know it.\u00a0 His son walks out with millions of dollars.\u00a0 The kid knows nothing.\u00a0 You know it, and so do we.\nGo ahead.\u00a0 Ask a question now.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The question, sir, was: What did you want President Zelensky to do about Vice President Biden and his son, Hunter?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Are you talking to me?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 It was a just a follow-up of what I just asked you, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 (Inaudible) finish with me.\u00a0 Listen.\u00a0 Listen.\u00a0 Are you ready?\u00a0 We have the President of Finland.\u00a0 Ask him a question.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I have one for him.\u00a0 I just wanted to follow up on the one that I asked you, which was \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Did you hear me?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 what did you want him to \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Did you hear me?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Ask him a question.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I will, but \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I\u2019ve given you a long answer.\u00a0 Ask this gentleman a question.\u00a0 Don\u2019t be rude.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No, sir.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to be rude.\u00a0 I just wanted you to have a chance to answer the question that I asked you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I\u2019ve answered everything.\u00a0 It\u2019s a whole hoax.\u00a0 And you know who\u2019s playing into the hoax?\u00a0 People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country.\u00a0 And I say, in many cases, the \u201ccorrupt media\u201d \u2014 because you\u2019re corrupt.\u00a0 Much of the media in this country is not just fake, it\u2019s corrupt.\nAnd you have some very fine people, too \u2014 great journalists, great reporters.\u00a0 But, to a large extent, it\u2019s corrupt and it\u2019s fake.\nAsk the President of Finland a question, please.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 I\u2019ll move on now.\u00a0 Mr. President, in your opening remarks, you said to President Trump that you had been to some museums today and that you respected the U.S. democracy and encouraged him to continue it.\u00a0 Are you concerned that that\u2019s not happening?\nAnd my second question to you, sir, is: The WTO ruled today in favor of the United States, saying that the United States can now impose tariffs on European goods because of illegal subsidies against Airbus.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 That was a big win for the United States, right?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was a big a win for the United States.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 You never had wins with other Presidents, did you?\u00a0 But we\u2019re having a lot of wins at the WTO since I became President.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This was a case that started, I think, 10 or 15 years ago.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Okay.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But it \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Excuse me.\u00a0 Your wins are now, because they think I don\u2019t like the WTO, and they want to make sure I\u2019m happy.\u00a0 Because all of those countries were ripping off the United States for many years.\u00a0 They know that I\u2019m wise to it.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a lot of wins.\nThis was a $7 billion win.\u00a0 Not bad.\u00a0 Go ahead.\nPRESIDENT NIINIST\u00d6:\u00a0 But I think the question is for me.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So the question, sir, is if you\u2019re concerned that the President will impose those tariffs and the effect that that may have on the economy.\nPRESIDENT NIINIST\u00d6:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 First of all, when I referred to your democracy, I just wanted to tell that I\u2019m impressed what American people have gained during these decades \u2014 a hundred-so years \u2014 building up very impressive democracy.\u00a0 So, keep it going on.\nTo WTO: I have a lot of respect to multilateralism and to international institutions.\u00a0 So, WTO has given now a decision which is, well, quite tough with Europe.\u00a0 But I just say that the WTO has set its opinion, and that\u2019s that.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 And I just want to finish by saying it\u2019s an honor to be with the President of Finland.\u00a0 He\u2019s done a fantastic job.\u00a0 Very popular, beloved over in Finland.\nThe WTO has been much better to us since I\u2019ve been President because they understand they can\u2019t get away with what they\u2019ve been getting away with for so many years, which is ripping off the United States.\nAnd please remember the President\u2019s last remarks: that we are a great democracy.\u00a0 We are a great \u2014 the United States is a great democracy.\u00a0 And I\u2019m airing what I\u2019m airing because we are, in fact, a democracy.\u00a0 And if the press were straight and honest and forthright and tough, we would be a far greater nation.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are, Mr. President.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 We would be a far greater when we don\u2019t have the CNNs of the world, who are corrupt people.\u00a0 Thank you very much, everybody.\nEND\n3:05 P.M.

EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great honor to have a man that\u2019s become a friend of mine \u2014 we\u2019ve gotten to know each other well \u2014 the President of Finland.\u00a0 And we have many things to discuss, including trade and military and purchases, and lots of different very exciting events.\nSo we\u2019ll have a long time together today.\u00a0 We\u2019ll then be having lunch.\u00a0 And I think we\u2019re going to be seeing the media right afterwards and say a few words.\nBut it\u2019s an honor, Mr. President, to have you with us.\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRESIDENT NIINIST\u00d6:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 I\u2019m waiting for our discussions.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 See?\u00a0 He\u2019s made a few words, and he gets it done.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 That\u2019s what I like about him.\nPRESIDENT NIINIST\u00d6:\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 Hope so.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 That\u2019s what I like about him.\nAnyway, okay, thank you all very much.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How do you respond to concerns that you are putting the whistleblower\u2019s life in danger?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, the whistleblower was very inaccurate.\u00a0 The whistleblower started this whole thing by writing a report on the conversation I had with the President of Ukraine.\u00a0 And the conversation was perfect; it couldn\u2019t have been nicer.\nI saw Rick Scott, I saw many of the senators talking about it, many of the congressmen talking about.\u00a0 Not a thing wrong.\u00a0 Unless you heard the Adam Schiff version, where he made up my conversation.\u00a0 He actually made it up.\u00a0 It should be criminal.\u00a0 It should be treasonous.\u00a0 He made it up \u2014 every word of it, made up \u2014 and read to Congress as though I said it.\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you what: He should be forced to resign from Congress \u2014 Adam Schiff.\u00a0 He\u2019s a lowlife.\u00a0 He should be forced to resign.\u00a0 He took a perfect conversation, realized he couldn\u2019t read it to Congress because it was perfect; it was a very nice conversation.\u00a0 I knew many people were on the phone.\u00a0 Not only were many people on the phone, we had stenographers on the phone taking it down, word for word.\nHe took that conversation, which was perfect; he said, \u201cI can\u2019t read this.\u201d\u00a0 So he made up a conversation and he reported it and said it to Congress and to the American people.\u00a0 And it was horrible was he said.\u00a0 And that was supposed to be coming from me, but it was all fabricated.\nHe should resign from office in disgrace.\u00a0 And, frankly, they should look at him for treason because he is making up the words of the President of the United States.\u00a0 Not only words, but the meaning.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a disgrace.\u00a0 It should not be allowed to happen.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But your own DNI said the call transcript was consistent with the complaint.\u00a0\u00a0 So, should only whistleblowers \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 No, no, no, he didn\u2019t say that.\u00a0 You have to take a look.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He did say that.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 No, no, no.\u00a0 He did not say that.\u00a0 And, in fact, if you look at what he said, he found everything to be very normal.\u00a0 He\u2019s a good man, and \u2014 Joe.\u00a0 And he found it to be very normal.\u00a0 I saw Schiff trying to go 15 \u2014 you know, we call him \u201cShifty Schiff.\u201d\u00a0 We don\u2019t call him \u201cShifty Schiff\u201d for nothing.\u00a0 He\u2019s a shifty, dishonest guy \u2014 who, by the way, was critical of one of the great Secretary of States.\u00a0 Graduated number one in his class at West Point.\u00a0 Graduated top of \u2014 one of the top in his class at Harvard Law School.\u00a0 The most honorable person, Mike Pompeo.\u00a0 And this guy was negative on Mike Pompeo.\nHe can\u2019t \u2014 you know, there\u2019s an expression: He couldn\u2019t carry his \u201cblank\u201d strap.\u00a0 I won\u2019t say it because they\u2019ll say it was so terrible to say.\u00a0 But that guy couldn\u2019t carry his \u201cblank\u201d strap.\u00a0 You understand that?\nSo, you\u2019re dealing with bad people.\u00a0 And, you know, I watched China over the last few days, and I watched some of these other countries build up, build up, build up.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve built up more than any of them because of me, but no help due to the Democrats.\u00a0 They\u2019re a disaster.\u00a0 They\u2019re the \u201cdo-nothing\u201d Democrats.\u00a0 They don\u2019t do any work.\u00a0 All they want to do is try and win the election in 2020, so they come up with this impeachment nonsense.\nAnd everyone knows the conversation \u2014 all based on a phone call that I had, where I\u2019m talking to the President of Ukraine.\u00a0 You\u2019ll hear from our ambassadors, you\u2019ll hear from some of the folks that know all about the call \u2014 why the call was set up and everything else.\u00a0 It\u2019s perfect.\u00a0 The call was perfect.\nIn fact, Lindsey Graham said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could be so nice.\u201d\u00a0 There was no quid pro quo.\u00a0 Remember, before they saw \u2014 the only reason I put that out \u2014 and I did it with the approval of Ukraine, by the way; otherwise, I couldn\u2019t have done it \u2014 was because the whistleblower was so dishonest.\u00a0 The whistleblower said terrible things about the call, but he then \u2014 I then found out he was second-hand and third-hand.\u00a0 In other words, he didn\u2019t know what was on the call.\nNo, these are bad people.\u00a0 These are dishonest people.\u00a0 And when the American people find out what happened, it\u2019s going to be a great day.\u00a0 And you know what?\u00a0 We have to go back to building our country, because 99 percent of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s time is spent on this.\u00a0 She should worry about lowering the price of drugs, which I\u2019ve done.\u00a0 But it\u2019s hard to do it without the help of Congress \u2014 about creating border security, which I\u2019ve done.\nWe\u2019ve built \u2014 we now have hundreds of miles of wall under construction on the southern border.\u00a0 She should worry about infrastructure.\u00a0 She should worry about the USMCA.\u00a0 She\u2019s not doing it.\u00a0 I just saw a part of her press conference before the President came.\u00a0 And I\u2019m sorry to bother you with this, Mr. President, because we have other things to talk about.\nPRESIDENT NIINIST\u00d6:\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 But I will tell you, I just watched part \u2014 she says, \u201cOh, drug prices\u2026\u201d\u00a0 Well, she\u2019s been trying to get drug prices down for \u2014 how long has she been in Congress?\u00a0 For years.\u00a0 She should focus on her own district.\u00a0 Do you see what\u2019s happening to her district?\u00a0 We call it \u201ctent city.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s terrible.\u00a0 In fact, we just sent a violation to the city of San Francisco: unsafe water, unsafe conditions, environmental \u2014 EPA.\nOur EPA, which is doing a great job, is sending Nancy Pelosi, with all the talk about EPA \u2014 there\u2019s needles and drugs all over the street.\u00a0 There\u2019s tents.\u00a0 There\u2019s people that are dying in squalor in the best location, in San Francisco.\u00a0 It used to be a great city.\u00a0 Now, you have to see what\u2019s happened to San Francisco.\u00a0 You happen to see what \u2014 what\u2019s \u2014 what the Democrats have allowed to happen.\u00a0 As an example, what they\u2019ve allowed to happen, just take a look, to Los Angeles.\u00a0 Great cities.\nOne other thing: Yesterday, as you know, I was sued by the Governor, Gavin Newsom \u2014 he\u2019s another beauty.\u00a0 I was sued by him.\u00a0 He\u2019s a do-nothing.\u00a0 Sued by him so that I can\u2019t get on the ballot in the state of California.\u00a0 It was a massive story.\u00a0 It was the biggest story, Mr. President.\u00a0 It was headlines all over the place: \u201cTrump gets sued by this do-nothing governor in California.\u201d\u00a0 It was big.\nHere\u2019s what happened: Yesterday, I won the case, very convincingly.\u00a0 A very tough, smart, highly respected judge \u2014 not a Trump person at all \u2014 not appointed by Trump; appointed by somebody that you would call the opposition \u2014 came out with a scathing and tough opinion.\u00a0 I won the case.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t see one story that I won that case \u2014 not one story \u2014 from the fake news.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t see Steve write it.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t see you write it.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t see anybody write it.\nSo, let me just tell you, just to finish: Nancy Pelosi and Shifty Shifft [sic] \u2014 who should resign in disgrace, by the way \u2014 and Jerry Nadler and all of them, it\u2019s a disgrace what\u2019s going on.\u00a0 And we should be focused on making America great again and keeping America great, because that\u2019s what we have to do.\nAnd when I look at that parade with military and millions of people and everything else, we better get smart.\u00a0 We better start focusing on the right things.\u00a0 Because what they did with this nonsense \u2014 think of it: You have a perfect \u2014 I mean, perfect, conversation with a President of another country \u2014 Ukraine, in this case \u2014 and they try and say, \u201cOh, let\u2019s impeach him.\u201d\nThey\u2019ve been trying to impeach me from the day I got elected.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been going through this for three years.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been trying to impeach me from the day I got elected.\u00a0 And you know what?\u00a0 They failed.\u00a0 And this is the easiest one of all, because this one is based on one conversation.\nWhat about Obama\u2019s conversation with the President of Russia, where he says, \u201cHey, hey, tell Vlad I\u2019ll talk to him after the election is over.\u00a0 I\u2019ll talk to him\u2026\u201d\u00a0 Nobody reports that, right?\u00a0 That\u2019s stuff you should report.\nBut you people should be ashamed of yourself.\u00a0 We have the most dishonest media that you can imagine.\u00a0 And you should be ashamed of yourselves.\nOkay, I think I\u2019ve answered most of your questions.\u00a0 What do you think?\nYes?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finnish media here.\u00a0 Finland is the happiest country in the world.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Finland is a happy country.\nPRESIDENT NIINIST\u00d6:\u00a0 Yeah, for sure.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What can you learn?\u00a0 What can you learn from Finland, which has a social-democratic (inaudible)?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, you got rid of Pelosi and you got rid of Shifty Schiff.\nPRESIDENT NIINIST\u00d6:\u00a0 We have time to discuss about that.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Finland is a happy country.\u00a0 He\u2019s a happy leader, too.\u00a0 (Laughs.)\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some Republicans have raised concerns \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 No Republicans have raised concerns.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 about the whistleblower, that their name \u2014 that the identity of the whistleblower should be protected.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I don\u2019t care.\u00a0 Look, I think a whistleblower should be protected if the whistleblower is legitimate.\u00a0 But when the whistleblower makes a big report on the conversation I had with a President, of Ukraine, and it was a great conversation.\u00a0 It was per- \u2014 we talked mostly about \u201ccongratulations on your win.\u201d\u00a0 We talked about corruption.\u00a0 And we\u2019re really referring mostly to 2016, because what the Democrats did in 2016 was corrupt.\nAnd let\u2019s see what happens.\u00a0 They\u2019re more concerned with that than they are with me and impeachment.\u00a0 They\u2019re trying to hide what maybe is coming.\u00a0 I let our great \u2014 if you look \u2014 I\u2019ll let our great law enforcement take care of it.\u00a0 Okay?\nAttorney General Barr, I guess, is working on it.\u00a0 And I hope he\u2019s working on it.\u00a0 Because what happened in 2016 is a disgrace to this country.\u00a0 And they\u2019re more worried about that because they know they\u2019re guilty as hell.\u00a0 All right?\u00a0 They\u2019re much more worried about that.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is the whistleblower immediately illegitimate if they are reporting misconduct about you?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 When a whistleblower \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 About you, sir?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Are you ready?\nI heard the whistleblower\u2019s report from you people, and how bad it was about just a simple conversation.\nBy the way, this whole thing revolves around a simple conversation.\u00a0 And if you remember at the beginning, it was \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s all you heard about.\u00a0 And I think he said seven or eight times: \u201cquid pro\u2026\u201d \u2014 in other words, \u201cYou\u2019re going to that or we\u2019re not going to give you money.\u00a0 You\u2019re going to do this or we\u2019re not going to\u2026\u201d\u00a0 I never said it.\nBut when I heard these horrible stories come out, I had no choice but to release a conversation \u2014 which I hate to do, and I hope I don\u2019t have to do it again \u2014 with the leader of a country.\u00a0 I asked a certain person to call up a certain person in that country to get permission to do it; otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it.\u00a0 And if I didn\u2019t do it \u2014 and I appreciate Ukraine for allowing us to release the conversation.\u00a0 But it was so innocent, it didn\u2019t hurt them.\u00a0 If anything, it helped them because it was a very innocent conversation.\nBut when a whistleblower takes that very nice, innocent \u2014 Lindsey Graham said, \u201cI never knew you were that nice a person.\u201d\u00a0 He said, \u201cYou never asked him for anything.\u00a0 You were really, really nice.\u201d\u00a0 Lindsey was saying, \u201cI never knew you were so nice.\u00a0 That was a perfect conversation.\u201d\nI heard Rick Scott today say, \u201cThat was a perfect conversation.\u00a0 How can they impeach him on that conversation?\u201d\u00a0 He read it.\u00a0 He\u2019s a very smart guy from Florida \u2014 Rick Scott \u2014 and he said, \u201cThat was a perfect conversation.\u00a0 How can you impeach somebody on that conversation?\u201d\nBut the whistleblower wrote not that conversation.\u00a0 He wrote a vicious conversation.\u00a0 In other words, he either got it totally wrong, made it up, or the person giving the information to the whistleblower was dishonest.\u00a0 And this country has to find out who that person was, because that person is a spy, in my opinion.\nAre you ready?\u00a0 So, when a whistleblower, purposely or not, gives something that\u2019s totally erroneous \u2014 now, here\u2019s where I fooled them.\u00a0 They never thought I\u2019d release the conversation.\u00a0 They never thought in a million years that I\u2019d release the conversation.\nWhen \u201cLiddle'\u201d Adam Schiff saw the text, when he read it, he couldn\u2019t believe it.\u00a0 When Nancy Pelosi, who worked a day early \u2014 Nancy Pelosi called for essentially impeachment \u2014 \u201cLet\u2019s impeach the President\u201d \u2014 before she saw the transcript.\u00a0 And this is an exact word-for-word transcript of the conversation, right?\u00a0 Taken by very talented stenographers.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well \u2014\nPRESDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Listen to me.\nSo when she saw that, she was \u2014 she \u2014 I heard she went crazy.\u00a0 She said, \u201cWe can\u2019t impeach him on this conversation.\u00a0 That\u2019s a great conversation.\u201d\u00a0 She went by the whistleblower.\u00a0 And the whistleblower was so bad, I would even think about it.\nBut here\u2019s what happened: The whistleblower was wrong.\u00a0 The only thing that matters is the transcript of the actual conversation that I had with the President of Ukraine.\u00a0 It was perfect.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking at congratulations.\u00a0 We\u2019re looking at doing things together.\u00a0 And what are we looking at?\u00a0 We\u2019re looking at corruption.\nAnd, in, I believe, 1999, there was a corruption act or a corruption bill passed between both \u2014 and signed \u2014 between both countries, where I have a duty to report corruption.\u00a0 And let me tell you something: Biden\u2019s son is corrupt, and Biden is corrupt.\u00a0 And I\u2019d rather run against Biden than almost any of those candidates.\u00a0 And I think they\u2019re all weak.\u00a0 But I think Biden has never been a smart guy, and he\u2019s less smart now than he ever was.\nThank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sir, have you actually wanted a moat on the border, sir?\u00a0 Sir, did you suggest a moat?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0\u00a0 Oh.\u00a0 Let me do that again; it\u2019s a fair question.\u00a0 So this morning and last night, my comms people came to me.\u00a0 Listen to this one, President.\u00a0 I\u2019m glad they\u2019re interested in Finland, but what can you do?\u00a0 I\u2019m interested in Finland much more.\nBut my comms people came to me, and they said, \u201cSir, there\u2019s a book or something being written.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s written by Washington Post people, so you know it\u2019s inaccurate.\u00a0 You know it\u2019s probably a fraud.\nSo two reporters from the Washington \u2014 and they said, \u201cPresident Trump started screaming, ranting, and raving, that on the southern border\u2026\u201d \u2014 where we are right now building a tremendous wall; it\u2019s unbelievable what\u2019s going up.\u00a0 Army Corps of Engineers.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019re doing a lot.\u00a0 We have \u2014 we\u2019ll soon have over 100 miles under construction and completed.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to end up with over 400 to 500 miles.\nOkay, ready?\u00a0 That I wanted a wall, but I wanted a moat.\u00a0 A moat \u2014 whatever that is.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a word I used, but they used it.\u00a0 A moat.\u00a0 And in the moat, I wanted alligators and snakes.\u00a0 And I wanted the wall to be a fence, and I wanted it to be electrified.\u00a0 And I wanted sharp spikes at the top, so if anyone gets it, it goes piercing through their skin \u2014 is somewhat the way they said it.\u00a0 Skin-piercing spikes.\u00a0 But I want the whole wall to be electrocuted.\nAnd, \u201cSir, you never said that.\u201d\u00a0 They came to me \u2014 the comms people.\u00a0 They came to me yesterday.\u00a0 And they said, \u201cDid you say this?\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhy are you asking that stupid question?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cBecause the fake news media is saying that you said this in a book.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhat book?\u201d\u00a0 And they said, \u201cWashington Post.\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cWell, obviously it\u2019s fake because almost everything the Washington Post does is fake.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a fake newspaper.\u00a0 It\u2019s owned by a rich guy for the purposes of giving him power in Washington.\u00a0 It\u2019s really \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a lobbyist \u2014 I call it the \u201cLobbyist Washington Post\u201d \u2014 for Amazon.\u00a0 And he ought to be ashamed of himself, because what they do to his reputation \u2014 I think maybe it\u2019s probably no good anyway.\u00a0 But what they do to his reputation with the Washington Post is a disgrace.\nSo these two reporters wrote this book, and they said I want a moat with alligators, snakes, electrified fences so people get electrocuted if they so much as touch the fence, and spikes on top.\u00a0 Never said it.\u00a0 Never thought of it.\u00a0 And I actually put out something on social media today.\u00a0 I said, I\u2019m tough on the border, but I\u2019m not that tough.\nOkay.\u00a0 It was a lie.\u00a0 Just so you have it \u2014\u00a0you asked the question.\u00a0 It was a total lie.\u00a0 It was corrupt reporting.\u00a0 Okay?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did you suggest \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I don\u2019t even \u201cfake\u201d anymore; I call the fake news now, \u201ccorrupt news.\u201d\u00a0 Because \u201cfake\u201d isn\u2019t tough enough, and I\u2019m the one that came up with the term \u2014 I\u2019m very proud of it \u2014 but I think I\u2019m going to switch it largely to \u201ccorrupt news.\u201d\u00a0 Because the media in this country \u2014 not everybody; we have some great reporters, some great journalists.\u00a0 But much of it is corrupt.\u00a0 It\u2019s corrupt.\u00a0 You have corrupt media in this country.\u00a0 And it truly is the enemy of the people.\nThank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Have a good day, everybody.\u00a0 Go write some phony stories.\nGo write some phony stories.\u00a0 Go write a Schiff-like story.\nJust another day in paradise.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Thank you, Steve.\u00a0 I hope I answered all your questions.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I didn\u2019t get \u2014 I didn\u2019t get one in.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Come here.\u00a0 Come here.\u00a0 Come here.\u00a0 What?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I was going to ask you (inaudible) limit the number of people who are listening on those phone calls \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I might.\u00a0 I might.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 I \u2014 and, by the way, I assume many people.\u00a0 I always do.\u00a0 When I speak to a leader \u2014 if I speak to Finland, I always assume that many people are listening.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 And the other thing is that Nancy Pelosi\u2019s account of my phone call is a total lie.\u00a0 I called her about guns, and then I heard her \u2014 she\u2019s talking about impeachment.\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhat are you talking about \u2014 impeachment?\u201d\u00a0 I called her to say I\u2019m making big progress on guns, okay?\nFellas, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re with us, here.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Inaudible) not here.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 But I\u2019m saying that \u2014 and I think you have to put that out.\u00a0 That would be the only thing.\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 Good.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Thank you, Steve.\u00a0 It was a lie.\u00a0 Her statement was a lie.\u00a0 But, you know, what else is new?\nThank you, everybody.\nEND\n12:26 P.M.

        "text": "Oval Office\n2:18 P.M. EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, this is a very big day.\u00a0 We just had the swearing-in.\u00a0 We just had the most beautiful ceremony.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if anybody was there, of you, but \u2014 our new head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\u00a0 And now we have Department of Labor.\u00a0 So, that\u2019s big stuff.\u00a0 This is a big day.\nAnd it\u2019s my pleasure to welcome everyone to the swearing-in of our new Secretary of Labor, Eugene Scalia.\u00a0 Gene is joined by many members of his family, which is a large family, including his mother, Maureen, who\u2019s been my friend for a long time, even before I knew you.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 His mother is an incredible woman.\u00a0 And his wife, Patricia.\u00a0 Incredible job.\u00a0 Thank you, honey.\u00a0 And six of their beautiful children.\nAnd I have a list of the folks.\u00a0 It\u2019s like \u2014 what a family.\u00a0 So you have Maureen, who a lot of the people in this room know, from the standpoint even of the media.\u00a0 You have Patricia, who is a very powerful person in the family \u2014 namely, the wife.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 The wife is always powerful \u2014 or, in some cases, right?\u00a0 But in this case \u2014\nMR. SCALIA:\u00a0 This one is.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Super powerful, right?\nAntonin Scalia\u2019s son.\u00a0 Antonin.\u00a0 We have Megan Scalia, daughter; Bridget Scalia, daughter; Luke Scalia, son; Erin Scalia, daughter; Isabella Scalia, daughter.\u00a0 That\u2019s pretty impressive.\u00a0 John Scalia, brother.\u00a0 Catherine Courtney, sister.\u00a0 Mary Clare Murray, sister.\u00a0 Reverend Paul Scalia, who many of the folks know, in the room.\u00a0 The most powerful man, by far, in the room.\u00a0 Reverend Paul Scalia, brother.\u00a0 Christopher Scalia, brother.\u00a0 Margaret Scalia Bryce, sister.\u00a0 Christie S. Larsen \u2014 oh, wow \u2014 father-in-law.\u00a0 Susan Larsen, mother-in-law.\u00a0 That\u2019s powerful.\u00a0 That\u2019s powerful stuff.\u00a0 That\u2019s a great \u2014 that\u2019s a great family.\nAnd, as you know, this was just happened \u2014 confirmed as the 20th Secretary of Labor, on September 26th, by a very substantial vote in current politics.\u00a0 Some people would say, \u201cGee, that was close.\u201d\u00a0 53 to 44.\u00a0 I call that a landslide.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 In this administration, I call it a landslide.\nEugene Scalia is one of the most qualified people ever confirmed as Secretary of Labor.\u00a0 He will use his skills as he has over the years, and he\u2019s built an extremely distinguished career to fight and win for the American workforce.\u00a0 He\u2019s a tremendous lawyer, a tremendous talent.\u00a0 One of the best anywhere in our country.\nHe earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from University of Virginia, and went on to the University of Chicago Law School, where he was editor-in-chief of the Law Review.\nFrom 2002 to 2003, Gene served as the top legal officer at the Department of Labor.\u00a0 So he\u2019s very familiar with the environs.\u00a0 He earned a reputation as a brilliant and unbiased defender of rights and protections of the American people.\nAfter his time in government service, Gene moved to the private sector, where he really became a tremendous force and very successful.\u00a0 He fought in some of the highest courts of our land, and worked to overturn bureaucratic overreach and unfair, job-killing regulations.\u00a0 That sounds very familiar.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to be good in this administration.\nAs he returns to the Department of Labor, Gene will use his wealth of experience to continue our bold regulatory reduction campaign.\u00a0 Most importantly, he will always put American workers first.\u00a0 I know that very well.\u00a0 That\u2019s what he\u2019s done his whole life.\nAnd your father is looking down right now.\u00a0 Your husband is looking down right now and proud as can be.\u00a0 You know that.\u00a0 You understand that.\u00a0 He\u2019s looking down and he is beaming.\u00a0 And I knew him well enough to know that he was a beamer when he was proud, right?\nMRS. MAUREEN SCALIA:\u00a0 Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 So, Gene, I\u2019m confident that your sharp legal mind, firmness of character, devotion to justice, love for this country, and commitment to its people will make you an outstanding Secretary of Labor.\u00a0 I want you to be the best.\u00a0 Can we say \u201cthe best of all time\u201d?\u00a0 I\u2019ll ask you, maybe later, who was the best, so far.\u00a0 But you\u2019re going to top.\nCongratulations to you and to your wonderful family.\nAnd I\u2019d like to now have Gene just say a few words and then we\u2019ll ask Vice President Pence to administer the oath of office.\u00a0 And thank you all for being here.\u00a0 This is a very important day.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR. SCALIA:\u00a0 Mr. President, thank you for those remarks.\u00a0 Thank you for this great honor to serve as Secretary of Labor.\u00a0 And thank you for what\u2019s also a great opportunity, as well, to hold that position in this administration with a President who\u2019s willing to try things that are different, not necessarily conventional, and as you remarked a moment ago, prepared to fight for things that he considers are important for the American people.\nYou offered this job to me back in July, in this office.\u00a0 And in that meeting, you expressed to me your commitment to American workers and to our economy.\u00a0 And I will bear those words in mind every day that I serve as Secretary of Labor.\nI also want to thank the President for the kindness that he has, in fact, shown my mother since even before his inauguration.\u00a0 It\u2019s a story few people know.\u00a0 I\u2019m fixing that right now, I think.\u00a0 But he reached out to my mother for \u2014 just out of kindness, with no political advantage, to see how she was doing, to then make sure that she had a good inauguration seat and the like.\u00a0 And he looked after an elderly woman who was going through a difficult time and gave her some help and support when it meant an awful lot.\u00a0 And we\u2019re very grateful.\nI do want to thank my mother, as well; my father who we do like to think is looking down and watching with some pride.\u00a0 And, of course, I want to thank my wife Trish for all of the support that she has given me, both in recent weeks, but throughout our marriage.\u00a0 And my brothers and sisters, too.\nMr. President, I\u2019m sorry that the group is \u2014 might strike you as small.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 There were three who couldn\u2019t make it, but they\u2019re here in spirit, too.\nSo, again, I want to thank the President and the Vice President for what is a great honor, but, more importantly to me, it\u2019s an opportunity to further the mission of the Department of Labor; to implement this President\u2019s agenda; and, to paraphrase the Constitution, to take care that our laws are faithfully executed.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Congratulations.\u00a0 Fantastic.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nMike?\u00a0 Thanks.\n(The oath is administered.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Congratulations, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY SCALIA:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, thank you all very much.\u00a0 Thank you very much, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you very much, everybody.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you know who the whistleblower is, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re trying to find out about a whistleblower \u2014 when you have a whistleblower that reports things that were incorrect.\u00a0 As you know, and you probably now have figured it out, the statement I made to the President of Ukraine \u2014 a good man, a nice man, new \u2014 was perfect.\u00a0 It was perfect.\u00a0 But the whistleblower reported a totally different statement.\u00a0 Like, the statement, it\u2019s \u2014 it was not even made.\u00a0 I guess \u201cstatement,\u201d you could say, was the call.\u00a0 I made a call.\u00a0 The call was perfect.\nWhen the whistleblower reported it, he made it sound terrible.\u00a0 And then, you had Adam Schiff who, even worse, made up my words, which I think is just a horrible.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never even seen a thing like that.\nAdam Schiff \u2014 representative, congressman \u2014 made up what I said.\u00a0 He actually took words and made it up.\u00a0 The reason is, when he saw my call to the President of Ukraine, it was so good that he couldn\u2019t quote from it because it \u2014 there was nothing done wrong.\u00a0 It was perfect.\u00a0 So Adam Schiff decided, \u201cI can\u2019t let this happen, so let me make up\u2026\u201d \u2014 did you ever hear of this one, Gene?\u00a0 You ever hear a thing like this?\u00a0 So Adam Schiff made up a phony call.\u00a0 And he read it to Congress and he read it to the people of the United States.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a disgrace.\u00a0 This whole thing is a disgrace.\nThere\u2019s been tremendous corruption.\u00a0 And we\u2019re seeking it.\u00a0 It\u2019s called \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d\u00a0 There\u2019s been corruption on the other side.\u00a0 There\u2019s been corruption like you\u2019ve never seen.\nNow, the new President of Ukraine ran on the basis of no corruption.\u00a0 That\u2019s how he got elected.\u00a0 And I believe that he really means it.\u00a0 But there was a lot of corruption having to do with the 2016 election against us.\u00a0 And we want to get to the bottom of it, and it\u2019s very important that we do.\nThank you very much.\nEND\n2:29 P.M.

EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mike.\u00a0 And I have to start off by saying that all of my life I\u2019ve heard that if it rains on a big occasion, it brings luck.\u00a0 So, Mark, I think you\u2019re going to be the luckiest general in history.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nI want to thank everybody for being here \u2014 Vice President Pence.\u00a0 And thank you all for the incredible service members.\u00a0 We have the finest military anywhere in the world.\u00a0 The American military is the greating \u2014 greatest fighting force, without question, in the history of the world.\u00a0 And today it\u2019s stronger than it\u2019s ever been, by a large factor.\u00a0 No enemy on Earth can match the awesome might of the American Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and the United States Marines.\nWe\u2019re gathered together for a truly historic occasion.\u00a0 We\u2019re here to welcome our outstanding new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: General Mark Milley.\u00a0 Mark, I want to congratulate you.\u00a0 You\u2019re my friend.\u00a0 You\u2019re my advisor.\u00a0 And you deserve this position.\u00a0 I never had a doubt.\u00a0 Congratulations.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI also want to express our profound gratitude to Mark\u2019s wife Hollyanne, and his children, Mary and Peter, for their selfless devotion to our country.\u00a0 The strength of our military is truly found in the love and support of our military families.\u00a0 So important.\u00a0 Those families are so important.\nWe\u2019re especially honored to be joined by some of America\u2019s Gold Star Families.\u00a0 Your treasured loved ones made the supreme sacrifice for our nation.\u00a0 They\u2019re looking down on you right now.\u00a0 You look up in the sky, and they\u2019re looking down on you.\u00a0 Our debt to you is infinite and eternal.\u00a0 America will hold you in its heart forever.\u00a0 And we will never forget.\nWe\u2019re also grateful to the many veterans here today.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 To our heroic wounded warriors in attendance: Our nation will always remember what you did for the cause of freedom.\nJoining us as well are: Secretary Mark Esper.\u00a0 Thank you, Mark.\u00a0 Great job you\u2019re doing.\u00a0 Secretary Mike Pompeo.\u00a0 Mike, thank you very much.\u00a0 EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler.\u00a0 Thank you, Andrew.\u00a0 Many of our great secretaries and my Cabinet and service chiefs.\nI know we have a couple of wonderful representatives \u2014 I think you have many, so I\u2019ll get myself in trouble, but I see John Carter and I see Brad Wenstrup.\u00a0 Thank you very much for being here, fellas.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 And I see a senator that\u2019s so supportive of our military and this administration, Senator Dan Sullivan.\u00a0 Thank you, Dan \u2014 of Alaska.\u00a0 Done a great job.\nAs we prepare to welcome a new Chairman, we must first pay tribute to one of America\u2019s most admired and beloved military leaders: outgoing Chairman Joseph Dunford, here today with his wonderful wife, Ellyn.\nJoe Dunford hails from just outside Boston.\u00a0 His father was a Marine \u2014 and a tough one \u2014 who landed on Inchon, in Korea, and fought at the Chosin Reservoir.\u00a0 So, Joe knew which branch he was destined to join.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t have too much of a decision to make, I think.\u00a0 What do you think about that?\u00a0 Huh?\u00a0 Not a big decision?\u00a0 No.\nIn 1977, he was commissioned into the U.S. Marine Corps.\nIn 2003, Joe commanded some of the first American troops in Operation Iraqi Freedom \u2014 and very, very successfully commanded them.\u00a0 For his exceptional bravery, he received the Legion of Merit with Combat Valor.\nAs a general, Joe was promoted so quickly that he was nominated for his third star before he had formally received his second.\u00a0 How do you do that?\u00a0 How do you do that, Joe?\nIn 2013, he was named International Security Assistance Force Commander in Afghanistan.\u00a0 And he was instrumental in strengthening Afghan security forces to share more of the burden.\u00a0 And today, they are indeed sharing much more of the burden.\nIn 2014, Joe became Commandant of the Marine Corps, and the next year he was named Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\u00a0 And in that role, Joe published the first Joint Military Net Assessment in 20 years.\u00a0 We have a lot of the ideas that we\u2019ve brought forward.\u00a0 And, you know, we\u2019ve spent $2.5 trillion since I\u2019m President \u2014 $2.5 trillion \u2014 far more than this country has ever even thought about spending.\u00a0 But we had to have a modern, great military with the most magnificent and the finest machinery, planes, boats, ships, weapons of all kinds.\u00a0 We\u2019ve never had anything like you have today.\u00a0 When I took over, we were a very depleted military, and today we\u2019re at a level that we have never even come close to.\nJoe solidified America\u2019s competitive advantage through global integration of the Joint Force.\u00a0 He also provided critical leadership during the complete rebuilding of our military.\nAnd he helped me in another way \u2014 something that probably only Joe and Ellyn really know \u2014 because in, I would say, in 2015, I sat with Joe at a dinner.\u00a0 And believe it or not, I was getting a big award from the Marines.\u00a0 And Joe was presenting the awards, and I had no even thought of running for President.\u00a0 And I said to my wife and family, \u201cLook at that guy.\u00a0 He\u2019s a great looking guy, isn\u2019t he?\u00a0 He\u2019s like central casting.\u00a0 He\u2019s like right out of Hollywood.\u201d\u00a0 But he made the great presentation that night.\nAnd I got to talk to him because I sat with him and Ellyn and his son, Patrick.\u00a0 And I was asking Joe lots of questions about the military.\u00a0 He said, \u201cYou really enjoy this, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0 I said, \u201cWell, I just love our country.\u00a0 It\u2019s very important to me.\u00a0 I love our country.\u201d\u00a0 And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u00a0 What do you think?\u00a0 Should I give it a shot?\u201d\u00a0 This was before it was public.\u00a0 He was one of the first people I asked.\u00a0 I said, \u201cWhat do you think?\u00a0 You think I\u2019d have a shot?\u00a0 If I get it, we\u2019re going to rebuild that military.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be stronger than ever before.\u201d\nAnd he helped me form an opinion.\u00a0 He gave me a lot of information.\u00a0 And he has ever since.\u00a0 So, for that, I want to thank you and Ellyn, and I want to thank Patrick.\u00a0 I hope I got his name right.\u00a0 It was a long time ago, but I think his name was Patrick, right?\u00a0 Huh?\u00a0 Did I do good?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nBut General Dunford also provided vital strategic direction to the campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.\u00a0 With his help and the great courage of our warfighters, I am proud to say that the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent completely obliterated.\u00a0 When we came to office, it was a mess; it was all over.\u00a0 Now we have thousands of captured ISIS fighters, and we have 100 percent of the caliphate.\nAs Chairman, Joe has also been a strong supporter and crucial advocate for creating the sixth branch of the U.S.\u00a0 Armed Forces \u2014 something that I\u2019m really proud about and something that, when I make these speeches in these massive arenas loaded up with people, thousands and thousands, it just about gets the number one line of applause because I say, \u201cWe\u2019re creating the Space Force.\u201d\u00a0 And the place goes crazy.\u00a0 Great popularity, because that\u2019s where it\u2019s going to be at, more and more.\nGeneral, your life exemplifies those words that beat in the heart of every Marine: Semper Fi.\u00a0 America salutes your incredible legacy of noble service.\u00a0 You\u2019ve been exceptional.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Joe.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I think they like you, Joe.\nAs one exceptional Chairman departs, our nation gains another.\u00a0 Today, Mark Milley takes General Dunford\u2019s place as the highest-ranking member of the most skilled, determined, and powerful military ever assembled in human history.\nMark has been preparing for his duty his entire life.\u00a0 Like Joe, he grew up in a family of patriots just outside of Boston.\u00a0 His dad was a Navy corpsman, and tough as can be, they say.\u00a0 Was he that tough?\nGENERAL MILLEY:\u00a0 He was that tough.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Huh?\u00a0 No games?\u00a0 He didn\u2019t play games?\nGENERAL MILLEY:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 No.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 He says, \u201cNo games.\u201d\nBut his dad was a strong Navy corpsman, serving with the\u00a04th Marine Division in World War Two \u2014 a veteran of the assault landings in the Marshall Islands campaign, the Mariana campaign, and in two Iwo Jima hits.\u00a0 During the war, Mark\u2019s mother also served at a Navy hospital in Seattle, treating wounded men from the Pacific.\nInspired by their example, Mark chose the path of duty and the life of service.\u00a0 He could have done whatever he wanted.\u00a0 He was exceptional in every way.\nIn 1980, he was commissioned into the Army, and quickly joined the ranks of its finest soldiers.\u00a0 He graduated from the Army Ranger School and became a master parachutist and a Green Beret.\u00a0 In a long Army career, Mark deployed to Panama, Colombia, Korea, Somalia, Egypt, Haiti, Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan \u2014 often seeing very, very close up the combat.\nHe has not just served, but shown immense valor, on nearly every continent.\u00a0 He is the recipient of the Distinguished Service Medal, four Bronze Stars, and the Legion of Merit, along with two awards of the Combat Infantry Badge.\nWith degrees from Princeton, Columbia \u2014 wow, I didn\u2019t know you were such a great academic.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Wow, let me give you a little more.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I\u2019m impressed with that.\u00a0 That\u2019s very good.\u00a0 And the Naval War College \u2014 but I liked you anyway \u2014 Mark is living proof that the American warfighter is the toughest, smartest and bravest, best and brightest, by far, anywhere in the world.\nFollowing four deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, he became the 39th Chief of Staff of the Army in 2015.\u00a0 Over the last several years, he has worked tirelessly to rebuild a depleted force into a fully manned, fully trained, and fully equipped Army prepared to achieve complete victory in the conflicts of tomorrow.\nAnd when we were determining where we were going to spend all of these billions of dollars, like you\u2019ve never seen \u2014 we haven\u2019t seen it in decades \u2014 I went with Mark, I sat with Mark, and I hope we spent it wisely, and I know we spent it wisely.\u00a0 Two and a half trillion dollars.\nHe built the Army Futures Command, and he created Security Force Assistance Brigades to reduce the need for large deployments.\nWhen Mark took over, only two Brigade Combat Teams were at the highest levels of readiness.\u00a0 Today, that number stands at 28 \u2014 an extraordinary turnaround and achievement.\u00a0 And I congratulate everybody here today.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAmerica\u2019s Armed Forces are more powerful than ever and growing even stronger.\u00a0 We have the newest equipment, and we also have equipment that we keep under wraps that nobody has ever even heard of.\u00a0 We have weapons that we pray to God we never have to use.\u00a0 Our nuclear has been totally rebuilt; some brand new and some refurbished.\u00a0 But we hope to God we never have to use any of our weapons \u2014 any of our weapons.\nIn his new role as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Milley will serve as my top military advisor.\u00a0 I have absolute confidence that he will fulfill his duty with the same brilliance and fortitude he has shown throughout his long and very distinguished career.\nFrom the great General Omar Bradley to the famed Joe Dunford, our nation has been blessed by the advice, counsel, and wisdom of 19 Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\u00a0 Today, we pass the baton to the 20th.\nTogether, we vow to continue the righteous mission that has united every Chairman and every patriot ever to wear the uniform and to defend our great American flag.\u00a0 We will keep America safe, we will keep America strong, and we will keep America proud so that our children and their children will forever and always be free.\nThank you again, General Dunford, for the incredible job you\u2019ve done.\u00a0 And to General Mark Milley: Good luck, Godspeed, God bless you, God bless our military, and God bless America.\u00a0 Thank you all for being here.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great honor.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEND\n12:05 P.M.

\u2014 her leadership that she\u2019s doing, as well.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And the Vice President as well \u2014 for all the hard work that they\u2019re doing.\nAnd I just want to say \u2014 you know, Nation Waste \u2014 who would have thought that this little girl, who came to America from El Salvador, not knowing English, went to school \u2014 through education \u2014 now owned a \u2014 not

continue to do what you\u2019re doing.\u00a0 You\u2019re doing very well.\u00a0 Thank you, Maria.\nAs we empower women in our own economy, last month, my daughter, Ivanka, traveled to South America \u2014 including Colombia, Paraguay, and Argentina \u2014 to highlight the W-GDP initiative, the critical role women play in creating economic opportunity, and the administration\u2019s commitment to empowering women all around the world.\u00a0 It was really something.\nAnd Ivanka has worked so hard for jobs and for women.\u00a0 And gets no credit for it, but she doesn\u2019t even care, I tell you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Well, she gets credit with the people that count.\u00a0 You know that.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 That\u2019s the people that we all know.\u00a0 She has done, really, a

It\u2019s something very special to watch.\nEvery day, my administration is working to deliver a more prosperous future.\u00a0 America is winning again and America is being respected again like it hasn\u2019t been respected in a long, long time.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nOur country right now is more powerful than ever before.\u00a0 We have achieved record funding for the U.S. military \u2014 two and a half trillion dollars over the last three years.\u00a0 We\u2019ve rebuilt it.\u00a0 When I was just coming into office, our military was totally depleted.\u00a0 It was depleted like you wouldn\u2019t want to even hear about, and it\u2019s been rebuilt.\u00a0 And it\u2019s bigger, better, stronger.\u00a0 We have an amazing military.\u00a0 Two and half trillion dollars.\nAnd we\u2019ll work on the budgets.\u00a0 But before we do the budgets, we have to rebuild our military.\u00a0 I think you understand.\u00a0 Otherwise \u2014 (applause) \u2014 otherwise budgets don\u2019t matter, right?\u00a0 Otherwise budgets don\u2019t matter.\nAnd we delivered a beautiful pay raise also for every soldier, sailor, airman, Coast Guardsman, and Marine.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 So, they\u2019re very happy.\u00a0 More than a quarter of a million Hispanic Americans bravely serve in our Armed Forces.\u00a0 That\u2019s a lot of people.\u00a0 And we\u2019re profoundly grateful to each and every one of them.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Great.\nAnd we\u2019re also incredibly thankful for the thousands of Hispanic Americans serving on the frontlines, protecting our borders.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And you know better than any people how important borders are.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Yes!\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You know better than anybody.\u00a0 You know, my poll numbers with Hispanics went way up.\u00a0 And they said, \u201cI wonder how that is?\u00a0 You want strong borders.\u201d\u00a0 Well, the Hispanics know better than anyone.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 You don\u2019t want people coming into our country that are going to do harm to you.\u00a0 And, frankly, you don\u2019t want people coming into our country that are going to take your jobs.\u00a0 It\u2019s very simple.\nSo, at first, I was even a little surprised to see those numbers.\u00a0 Mike and I were discussing it.\u00a0 And then, all of the sudden, it made a lot of sense.\u00a0 It made a lot of sense.\nBut we \u2014 right now, Mexico has been a tremendous help to us \u2014 the President of Mexico.\u00a0 We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our southern border.\u00a0 They\u2019ve never had any.\u00a0 We\u2019ve literally never had virtually any Mexican soldiers, and we have 27,000 now.\u00a0 We can\u2019t get the Democrats to do what they\u2019re supposed to do with the loopholes or with asylum.\u00a0 No, they\u2019re not doing their job.\u00a0 We call them the \u2014 they\u2019re not \u2014 they\u2019re not doing their job.\u00a0 The \u201cdo-nothings,\u201d right?\u00a0 The do-nothings.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:\u00a0 They\u2019re not patriots!\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 They\u2019re not \u2014 well \u2014\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 They hate America!\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You can \u2014 (laughs).\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 They don\u2019t love us!\u00a0 They don\u2019t love us!\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You\u2019re better off saying it.\u00a0 You\u2019re better \u2014 you\u2019re better off saying it.\u00a0 You people are really out there.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Four more years!\u00a0 Four more years!\u00a0 Four more years!\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Four more years!\u00a0 Four more years!\u00a0 Four more years!\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 So, we\u2019re really doing a job with borders.\u00a0 We\u2019re really doing a job with the economy \u2014 number-one economy.\u00a0 We\u2019re at number one at everything.\u00a0 We have the strongest military \u2014 by the way, strongest military by far, anywhere in the world.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to keep it that way, if not make it even stronger.\u00a0 More than \u2014\nAnd, hopefully, by the way \u2014 hopefully, we don\u2019t have to use it.\u00a0 Hopefully \u2014 and, you know, interestingly, the stronger it gets, the less likely it is that we have to use it, you know?\u00a0 That\u2019s sort of the way it goes in life, unfortunately.\nMore than half of our Border Patrol agents are Hispanic, and more than a quarter of our ICE agents \u2014 and those ICE agents are incredible, and they are Hispanic.\u00a0 And they are tough.\u00a0 They are tough.\u00a0 They\u2019re patriots.\nAnd we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re moving MS-13 gang members and some of these horrible people \u2014 (applause) \u2014 boom.\u00a0 They\u2019re being brought out.\u00a0 They\u2019re being brought out of our country by the thousands \u2014 by the thousands.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS:\u00a0 Bad hombres.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 And they are bad.\u00a0 As you say, bad \u2014 they\u2019re bad hombres.\u00a0 You better believe it.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 He\u2019s \u2014 he said \u2014 (laughter).\u00a0 I used that word once, and nobody has let me forget it, right?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMany of these agents are themselves immigrants or the children of immigrants.\u00a0 And they\u2019re incredible people \u2014 extraordinary patriots who uphold our laws and safeguard our communities.\nWe\u2019re honored to have with us one of our finest: Patrol Agent Jose Avina.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And, Jose, if you could come up.\u00a0 Come on up, Jose.\u00a0 Say a few words.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAGENT AVINA:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, for inviting my family and I.\u00a0 We\u2019re grateful and honored to be here with you tonight, celebrating our Hispanic Heritage Month with these amazing people here.\nI want to praise God for this opportunity to salute the brave men and women of the United States Border Patrol \u2014 (applause) \u2014 who are out there working tirelessly, keeping America safe.\nAs chaplains, we have the honor to be by the side of agents\u2019 families who are injured, who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.\u00a0 We pray for them.\u00a0 We walk with them through their journey of grief.\u00a0 And we, step by step, continue with their lives.\nWe have the honor to be with those agents whose children are battling cancer, like the Reyna family.\u00a0 The opportunity to accompany the death of a spouse, a parent, or a child \u2014 like the Gomez and Morales family \u2014 I had the honor to serve with both of these families at Police Week.\nI have the daily privilege of working with some of the most compassionate men and women who render aid to the injured, rescue people who have been walking for days or were drowning.\u00a0 These agents who volunteer after \u2014 as coaches, mentors in our communities.\nFinally, I want to thank my parents: my mother, who worked so hard after my dad was injured and could no longer work.\u00a0 She\u2019s an example of a tough, hardworking Latina who never gives up.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI also want to thank my beautiful wife, Amy;

AVILA:\u00a0 My name is Martha Avila, president and co-founder of Heartbeat of Miami Pregnancy Health Medical Clinics.\u00a0 Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, thank you for the honor of being here.\nI am a Cuban American, and it saddens me that Cuban Americans and African Americans, even though we\u2019re a minority, we \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, Hispanics and African Americans are the minority, yet we form the majority of abortions in our country.\u00a0 One out of two pregnancies of African Americans ends up in abortion, and one out of three Hispanic pregnancies ends up in abortion.\u00a0 And that saddens me.\nAnd on behalf of Heartbeat of Miami and the pro-life movement, we want to thank you for what to you do for life.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Our President does stand for life \u2014 life of the unborn and all lives.\nAnd I just want to thank you for that, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you, Martha.\u00a0 That\u2019s beautiful.\nMS. AVILA:\u00a0 We \u2014 over 3,000 pregnancy clinics throughout the nation, with very limited resources \u2014 are doing this labor of love for those that don\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0 They\u2019re confused.\u00a0 They don\u2019t have a way out, and they think that abortion is the only solution.\u00a0 Yet, we offer them the opportunity to parent their babies, and the opportunity of a plan of adoption.\u00a0 That is what we do.\nSo pregnancy clinics are good for America.\u00a0 And one day, abortion will be unthinkable \u2014 unthinkable in our country.\u00a0 So, God bless you all.\u00a0 God bless you both.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Thank you, Martha.\u00a0 Great job.\nWell, thank you very much, Martha.\u00a0 And every day, millions of Hispanic Americans like Martha are making tremendous contributions, achieving extraordinary breakthroughs, and enriching every corner of this incredible country of ours.\nThere is no part of American society you have not made better \u2014 Hispanic Americans.\u00a0 There is no aspect of American life you have not made stronger.\u00a0 And I know that I speak for all Americans when I say that we could not be prouder of our Hispanic American community than we are today.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo to all of you here today: On behalf of Mike and myself and the Cabinet \u2014 this is a great Cabinet that we have, and I want to thank them for being here.\u00a0 But I want to thank you for your devotion to your country.\u00a0 Thank you for your contribution to our culture.\u00a0 And thank you for helping make America greater than ever before.\u00a0 It is greater than ever before.\u00a0 Remember that.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nGod bless you all.\u00a0 And God Bless America.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Four more years!\u00a0 Four more years!\u00a0 Four more years!\nEND\n7:28 P.M.\n"

healthcare, drug abuse and prevention in this state, as well as some great friends and a great colleague from our nation\u2019s capital.\nIt\u2019s great to be back home in Indiana.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a great couple of days.\u00a0 I was yesterday on the east side of Indianapolis, talking about creating jobs with the largest new trade deal in American history.\nI had a chance to stop by an elementary school in my hometown because they invited me earlier today.\u00a0 A third grade class at Southside Elementary asked me to come in, and we\u2019ve kind of been pen pals for a while.\u00a0 And that was a great thrill.\nI stopped by to see our troops at Camp Atterbury, who are preparing to deploy.\nBut I have to tell you, it is a joy for me to be back here at the NeuroDiagnostic Institute, which is an extraordinary statement about Indiana\u2019s leadership in the whole area of mental health and also in combatting opioid abuse and addiction.\nI specifically want to thank the Surgeon General of the United States \u2014 my friend, Dr. Jerome Adams \u2014 for being here and for his tremendous work on combatting opioid abuse and addiction.\nWe are encouraged that, nationwide, in the last year we\u2019ve seen a 5 percent reduction in overdose deaths from opioid abuse.\u00a0 And it is a beginning of progress, but one that our administration and I know Dr. Adams is absolutely determined to continue to build on that.\u00a0 But we\u2019re grateful that you\u2019d be here with us, and thank you for your service to the country.\nI\u2019m also grateful to be joined by a former colleague of mine when I had my last job in this state.\u00a0 Dr. Jennifer Sullivan is now the head of Indiana Family and Social Services.\u00a0 And this NeuroDiagnostic Institute is a project of the state of Indiana, and Community East really represents the very best of a public and private partnership.\u00a0 And, Dr. Sullivan, I want to thank you for your great leadership in helping to bring it about.\nAlso, I want to congratulate Dr. Jerry Sheward for his great work here.\u00a0 He\u2019s the superintendent and the chief medical officer here at NDI, and, I think as of this spring, stood up this extraordinary institution, which is, in fact, the first mental health hospital constructed in the state of Indiana in a half a century.\nAnd it was my great privilege to break ground at this site in my last year as Governor of the state of Indiana.\u00a0 And to be back here, Dr. Sheward and Dr. Sullivan, and to see this magnificent building, which is already meeting the needs of patients, is a great tribute to your efforts, to your leadership, and to the leadership the state of Indiana has brought to this project.\nI\u2019m grateful, as a Vice President of the United States, to see a state leading on a renewed commitment to mental health.\u00a0 But I\u2019m also proud, as a Hoosier, to see the state of Indiana really creating a model for other communities and other states around the nation to address the challenges that we face from not only drug abuse and addiction, but also the challenges that mental health pose to public safety.\u00a0 And I want to speak about that in our roundtable today.\nI want to extend to you the gratitude and the greetings of the President of the United States.\u00a0 I told President Trump that I would be here.\u00a0 And I can assure you, as we can have been confronting this crisis of opioid abuse and addiction since early in this administration, and as we have been dealing as a nation with unspeakable acts of violence, most recently in Texas and in Ohio, that there is at least evidence \u2014 are driven by individuals with deep mental illness.\nThis example in Indiana \u2014 of the state of Indiana making a commitment to expand facilities here \u2014 really represents a model for the nation.\u00a0 And the President and I have talked about it frequently.\u00a0 And, Bryan Mills, I want to commend you and Community Hospital for really partnering with the state of Indiana to make this a reality.\nI was \u2014 I was mentioning the fact that we\u2019ve seen a 5 percent reduction in opioid overdoses nationwide.\u00a0 But if the statistics hold, Indiana is looking at roughly a 12 percent reduction in deaths from opioid overdoses.\u00a0 And that is a tribute to Governor Eric Holcomb, to this administration\u2019s commitment to combatting opioid abuse and addiction, to strong law enforcement efforts, but it\u2019s also a tribute to the healthcare community in this state.\u00a0 And so I want to extend to you our gratitude.\nIt\u2019s amazing to think a reduction in overdoses \u2014 the number of lives that are saved in this state and around this country.\u00a0 And I just want to assure you that as we talk about expanding mental health services here in the state of Indiana, I\u2019m going to be taking this back before the end of the day to meet with the President and share with him what Indiana has been able to do here and our determination to work with Congress in a bipartisan way to address the scourge of opioid abuse and addiction, to address the needs of mental health in this country, with national solutions.\nThe President truly believes that, in the wake of mass shootings that not only beset Texas and Ohio, but in our tenure, Sutherland Springs, Texas, and Las Vegas, and other days that just broke the heart of the American people \u2014 we believe part of the answer is strong law enforcement; part of the answer is prevention.\u00a0 But we also believe \u2014 the President and I believe strongly that part of the answer is a renewed commitment to mental health in the United States.\u00a0 And I\u2019m incredibly proud that Indiana is leading the way.\nAnd with the construction of this beautiful NeuroDiagnostic Institute \u2014 the first mental health hospital constructed in the state of Indiana in 50 years \u2014 I want to congratulate each of you on really providing a model for other states around the country and an inspiration to leaders in our nation\u2019s capital to do more in the area of mental health.\nSo, thank you very much.\u00a0 And, Dr. Adams, thank you again for being here.\nEND\n"

about 85 military police preparing to deploy into Afghanistan; the engineers to Kuwait.\u00a0 But each one of you has your own personal story.\u00a0 And I was particularly moved, as the son of a combat veteran and the father of a United States Marine, to know that there is a father-son unit getting ready to deploy.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t know \u2014 I got to find out from somebody if that\u2019s ever happened before in the history of the Indiana National Guard.\u00a0 But it just underscores the commitment of families in this state to our national defense.\nSo would you join me in congratulating and thanking First Sergeant Brian Schultheis and Lieutenant Brett Schultheis?\u00a0 Where are you guys?\u00a0 Put your hands in the air.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 I know how proud you are, and I know how nervous you are going downrange with your dad.\u00a0 I appreciate both of you, and I appreciate your family.\u00a0 And it really is amazing to see you all here today.\nAs I mentioned, it was probably one of the greatest honors of my life when I was Commander-in-Chief of the Indiana National Guard as your governor.\u00a0 Thirteen thousand men and women.\u00a0 It\u2019s amazing to think Indiana is not the seventh-largest state in America, but we boast the seventh-largest National Guard in this country.\u00a0 And that says an awful lot about families in this state and the commitment to providing for the common defense.\nAnd so I just wanted to come by and really say two things.\u00a0 First and foremost, thank you for your service.\u00a0 Thank you for stepping up for Indiana and for America.\nAnd secondly, on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief, I just encourage you: Take the opportunity to be ready, which is the motto of Camp Atterbury and has been for decades.\u00a0 Use this time of training to sharpen yourselves and be prepared to deploy and bring real excellence and professionalism to this effort.\u00a0 Be vigilant.\u00a0 Respect the unified chain of command.\u00a0 Trust your superiors.\u00a0 Trust your orders.\u00a0 Mind your people and mind your mission.\u00a0 And know that the American people are counting on you, because we know we can.\nYou know, I stand before you today, and the last thing I would say to each one of you is, from the bottom of my heart \u2014 is just: Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for stepping forward in this all-volunteer military.\u00a0 Thank you for being the citizen soldiers that the National Guard are here in Indiana and all across America.\nKnow that you go with the confidence of you Commander-in-Chief.\u00a0 Know that you go with the gratitude of the people of Indiana and this nation.\u00a0 But also know that you go with the prayers of people all across this state.\u00a0 And be assured of that as you prepare for deployment, as you go downrange, that you will be carried by the prayers of the people of Indiana and the people of this country.\nWe will pray every day that no harm would befall you, no danger would come near you, and that you would do your job protecting this nation and return home safe to your families.\u00a0 That, we will pray.\nSo thank you very much.\u00a0 God bless the Indiana National Guard.\u00a0 God bless the Hoosier State.\u00a0 And God bless America.\u00a0 It\u2019s great to be home.

Machinery.\u00a0 This is a great American success story and it\u2019s about to become even more successful for Indiana and the future.\u00a0 Thank you, Chris.\u00a0 Thank you, MacAllister.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd as I get started, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine.\u00a0 I saw him just yesterday, told him I was headed back to the Hoosier State, and I think he sounded just a little bit jealous.\u00a0 (Laughter).\u00a0 So let me bring greetings from a man who loves the state of Indiana every bit as much as I do, who the people of Indiana said \u201cyes\u201d to in 2016 and made the 45th President of the United States of America.\u00a0 I bring greetings from President Donald Trump.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd please be seated.\u00a0 It\u2019s great to be with you all.\u00a0 Thanks for coming out in the sunshine.\nBut I\u2019m here on the President\u2019s behalf because we\u2019ve got an incredible opportunity before us.\u00a0 You know, one of the things that I learned representing Indiana for years in Washington, D.C., and growing up down in Bartholomew County, and serving as your Governor, is the important role that trade plays in the life of the state of Indiana.\u00a0 You know, in the Hoosier State, we do two things well: We make things and we grow things, and then we sell them to the world.\nAnd as I stand before you today, we have before the Congress what will be the largest trade deal in American history.\u00a0 And I came to Indiana to say it\u2019s time for Congress to pass the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and pass it this year.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo we\u2019re going to talk about trade today.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to talk about a great opportunity for Hoosier workers and Hoosier businesses.\u00a0 But before that, let me just take a minute to reflect on the progress that we\u2019ve made because of the confidence the people of Indiana placed in this President and this team now just a better part of three years ago.\u00a0 It\u2019s amazing for me to think all that time has already passed.\nBut I\u2019ve got to tell you, when I think of the last two and a half years, there\u2019s only one way I can describe it.\u00a0 It\u2019s been two and a half years of action, two and a half years of results, two and a half years of promises made and promises kept.\u00a0 And we\u2019re just getting started, Indiana.\nWhile many Democrats have spent the last two and a half years, I think there\u2019s only one way you can describe it, my fellow Hoosiers: I think it\u2019s been two and a half years of action.\u00a0 It\u2019s been two and a half years of results.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s been two and a half years of promises made and promises kept.\u00a0 And we\u2019re just getting started Indiana.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIt\u2019s really why I\u2019m here today.\u00a0 And the truth is, while we\u2019re watching our nation\u2019s capital \u2014 even today we see many Democrats who spent the last two and a half years on baseless accusations and they keep trying to overturn the will of the American people in the last presidential election \u2014 I\u2019m here to make you a promise: Whatever the Democrats and their allies want to spend their time on, President Donald Trump and I are going to stay focused on the issues that matter most to you \u2014 (applause) \u2014 a strong national defense, secure borders, safe streets, and jobs, jobs, jobs.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve been doing.\nI mean, if you think about the last two and a half years, it\u2019s really remarkable.\u00a0 I mean, this President promised to revive the American economy.\u00a0 And right out of the gate \u2014 right out of the gate, we went to work with strong conservative voices representing Indiana on Capitol Hill.\nIn our first two years, this President signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history.\u00a0 We signed more bills cutting federal red tape than any administration in American history.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve unleashed American energy.\nAnd this year, America is the leading producer of oil and natural gas on Earth.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 In fact \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you heard this \u2014 next year, for the first time in 75 years, America will be a net exporter of energy to the world.\u00a0 We are on the road to energy independence, America.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd in addition to tax cuts and rolling back regulation and unleashing American energy, this President also promised to stand for free and fair and reciprocal trade that puts American jobs and American workers first.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve been doing that since day one.\u00a0 The results of all of that have really been remarkable.\nAs I stand before you today in this September of 2019, since Election Day 2016, businesses just like this one \u2014 businesses large and small across America \u2014 have created 6.3 million new jobs, including 79,000 jobs right here in the Hoosier State.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nUnemployment has hit a 50-year low, and unemployment here in the state of Indiana is even lower, at 3.4 percent.\nNationwide, we have the lowest unemployment numbers ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans.\u00a0 And the most exciting thing to the President and me is to see that the American Dream is working again for every American.\u00a0 This economy is booming and working for everybody.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n(Audience interruption.)\nAUDIENCE:\u00a0 Booo \u2014\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Let me say it again: This economy is working for every American.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s true.\u00a0 Even for people who don\u2019t agree with us.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It\u2019s still working.\u00a0 It\u2019s incredible.\nAnd, you know, for proof of that, you don\u2019t have to look any further than manufacturing.\u00a0 And, you know, manufacturing has made an incredible comeback in the last two and a half years, which is a real contrast from the last administration.\nI mean, I remember, in the summer of 2016, the last President \u2014 who had overseen the loss of 200,000 manufacturing jobs in this country, and said we basically were never going to get them back.\u00a0 You remember that?\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0 The \u201cmagic wand.\u201d\u00a0 I mean, the last President actually asked the question; he said, \u201cWhat magic wand do you have to bring back manufacturing jobs?\u201d\u00a0 Well, you all know we didn\u2019t need a magic wand; we just needed President Donald Trump in the White House.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn fact, after the last administration lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs, now there are \u2014 in fact, there are more manufacturing job openings than at any time in the last decade.\u00a0 And, in 2018, among \u2014 we saw the highest optimism ever among manufacturers all across this country.\u00a0 And instead of losing 200,000 manufacturing jobs, 500,000 jobs have come roaring back across Indiana and across America.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 In fact, 17,000 manufacturing jobs have come right here to the Hoosier State.\nAnd for working men and women gathered here and looking on: You know, it\u2019s not just been about more jobs.\u00a0 It\u2019s been about better jobs.\u00a0 I mean, since President Trump took office, the average American household has seen their disposable income go up by $5,000 a year.\u00a0 And wages are rising at the fastest pace that they have in more than a decade.\u00a0 And I think what\u2019s most exciting to the President and me: Wages are rising most rapidly among blue-collar, working-class Americans.\u00a0 The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd these results didn\u2019t just happen.\u00a0 They happened because of the policies that this President put into place.\u00a0 And frankly, they happened because Indiana and America have the greatest workers and the greatest businesses in the world.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 You give Americans a chance to compete and excel, and they seize it every single time.\nThe truth is, those numbers tell the tale.\u00a0 Under this President, a rising tide is lifting all boats \u2014 just like so many companies that you see right now across the state of Indiana, and just like MacAllister Machinery thriving right here in central Indiana.\nYou know, I\u2019ve been pleased to hear that, under the President\u2019s leadership and our administration \u2014 Chris just told me \u2014 that MacAllister\u2019s sales are up, and revenues are breaking records.\u00a0 Congratulations, Chris.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nYou know, I grew up just down the road in Columbus, and, you know, I really am amazed and deeply grateful for what the MacAllister family has been able to accomplish for central Indiana, and the contributions that they\u2019ve made.\nThis company is a great American success story.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a story about the success of the American Dream.\u00a0 I\u2019m told it all started back in 1945, when Chris\u2019s grandfather became the exclusive Caterpillar dealer for 68 Indiana counties.\u00a0 And in the seven decades since, this company has grown.\u00a0 It\u2019s been not only a pillar of its industry, but it\u2019s been a pillar of this community, contributing to our state capital, contributing to the life of this state in countless ways.\nMacAllister now has 26 facilities in Indiana.\u00a0 And, in 2011, I\u2019m told that you expanded next door into the Wolverine State, when you purchased Michigan Cat.\u00a0 Now you\u2019ve created more than 1,100 jobs here in Indiana and just about as many in Michigan.\u00a0 That is a company that is on a roll.\u00a0 Congratulations, Chris.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut, you know, for all the MacAllister team here \u2014 and Chris would be the first to say \u2014 that this company\u2019s steady growth \u2014 it\u2019s a testament to policies that have given MacAllister the chance to grow and expand.\u00a0 But it\u2019s mostly a testament to all of you \u2014 to your work ethic, to your integrity, the quality of people that make this company work.\nLike I learned today about a proud Hoosier from Plainfield, Indiana, who is a part of this company. \u00a0He also served our country in the United States Army.\u00a0 He was stationed outside Saigon during the Vietnam War.\u00a0 But after he transitioned back to civilian life, he actually joined MacAllister.\u00a0 He started as a truck mechanic, and he\u2019s worked his way up, all the way to being a facilities engineer.\nAnd this year, he marks his 40th year with MacAllister Machinery.\u00a0 Where are you, Mike Hensilwood?\u00a0 Take a bow, will you?\u00a0 Great job.\u00a0 And thank you for your service, Mike.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 I\u2019m proud of you.\u00a0 Great job.\nMike\u2019s really emblematic, I know, of all of you.\u00a0 He\u2019s also emblematic of the vi- \u2014 visionary leadership of this great company.\u00a0 So let me take a moment \u2014 let me take a moment to recognize one other MacAllister.\u00a0 He\u2019s a man who I can say has been a friend of mine for almost 40 years \u2014 really kind of painful for me to say that.\u00a0 I marked my 60th year, and this is a man that\u2019s been in my life and been an encouragement to me throughout all of that time.\u00a0 In, fact, I scarcely believe that I would be where I am today if it wasn\u2019t for the man that I want to mention.\nHe really is considered, by many, as one of the greatest business leaders that Indianapolis has ever known.\u00a0 But he\u2019s more proud of that fact that he was a proud veteran of the Army Air Corps.\u00a0 To know him is to know a man who believes in America.\u00a0 He\u2019s a Renaissance man if there ever there was one in the Hoosier State.\u00a0 And he\u2019s a man of deep faith \u2014 deep faith in this country and deep faith in God.\nIn fact, back when I was your governor, I gave him the highest award that\u2019s afforded to any citizen of the state of Indiana, and it was just a small token of the admiration that the city and the state feels for P.E. MacAllister.\u00a0 Would you all join me in showing our appreciation for a truly remarkable Hoosier?\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Still working every day and getting a paycheck after 74 years on the job.\u00a0 Thank you, P.E.\u00a0 A truly amazing American and a great friend.\nBut, you know, I know that P.E. would be the first one to say that Mike and the others that are here gathered with us today are really the reason that this company works.\u00a0 And I know he\u2019d be especially proud, as a veteran of our armed forces, to point out that Mike isn\u2019t the only one in this company that\u2019s worn the uniform of the United States.\u00a0 In fact, I\u2019m told that there are veterans here today, serving at MacAllister Machinery, who served in all the branches of our armed forces.\nSo if you\u2019re able, if you\u2019re a veteran of our armed forces today or in active duty, would you just mind standing up?\u00a0 Stand up and let us thank you one more time for all you\u2019ve done for our country and our freedom.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for your service.\nYou know, Hoosiers like Mike and P.E. and these veterans that we just saw and all the team here show that MacAllister Machinery is a great company.\u00a0 This is a great state.\u00a0 And, frankly, we just have the \u2014 we have the best people in the world.\u00a0 And I believe, as President Trump does, that as long as we have a level playing field, American workers can compete and win with any workers in any businesses in the world.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been fighting for that.\u00a0 That\u2019s why, since the first day of this administration, President Trump and I have been working to hold our trading partners accountable, to open up foreign markets across the globe, to level the playing field \u2014 what the President likes to say, is for \u201cfree, fair, and reciprocal trade.\u201d\nThat \u201creciprocal\u201d word is one that he uses most often, and it basically says: If you\u2019re going to have access to the freest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world, we\u2019d like the same access to your economy and to your consumers.\nWe\u2019ve been busy from the first days of this administration.\u00a0 President Trump renegotiated our trade agreement with South Korea.\u00a0 Just yesterday, in New York City, at the U.N., the President announced another trade agreement, this time with Japan, that\u2019s going to open up their market to $7 billion more in American agriculture.\u00a0 That\u2019s a win for Indiana, and it\u2019s a win for America.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd after years of massive trade deficits and intellectual property theft, President Donald Trump put China on notice that the era of economic surrender is over.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 We\u2019re standing strong.\nBut what brings me here today, as I said at the start, is that this President also drove a hard bargain, and he negotiated what will be the largest trade deal in American history.\u00a0 We call it the \u201cUSMCA\u201d\u00a0\u2014 the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\u00a0 And I came home to ask my fellow Hoosiers for your help in getting this thing done and getting it done this year.\nAnd it\u2019s going to make a huge difference.\u00a0\u00a0 I mean, according to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA will add more than $68 billion to our economy.\u00a0 And it\u2019s projected to add more than 175,000 jobs just in the early going, once it passes \u2014 including, we\u2019re projecting, about 50,000 more manufacturing jobs.\nAnd, again, we\u2019re not just creating more jobs, but better jobs.\u00a0 The International Trade Commission tells us that, under the USMCA, American manufacturing workers are going to get another raise, on top of the raise they\u2019ve already received at record levels under President Trump.\u00a0 The USMCA is a win for working Americans.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd it\u2019s no real surprise, if you think about it.\u00a0 According to the National Association of Manufacturers, Canada and Mexico purchase one fifth of America\u2019s manufacturing products.\u00a0 That\u2019s amazing.\u00a0 And they buy more American products than any of our next 10 trading partners.\nIt isn\u2019t that they live just next door, it\u2019s that they are a critical destination for what we grow and what we make.\u00a0 In fact, more than 2 million American manufacturing jobs actually depend on trade with Mexico and Canada, including 61,000 jobs right here in the Hoosier State.\nSo Indiana has got a lot to gain from the USMCA.\u00a0\u00a0And as I said before, we do two things well here: We make things and we grow things.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got customers all around the world who want to buy our products.\u00a0 We really do.\nIn fact, here\u2019s your numbers.\u00a0 Last year, Indiana exported 39 billion dollars\u2019 worth of goods supporting more than 180,000 jobs.\u00a0 And that includes $10 billion in exports just from the Indianapolis area alone.\nAnd I\u2019m proud to say that Indiana is number 12 in the nation in exports overall.\u00a0 And our exports are growing fast in this state.\u00a0 In fact, they\u2019ve gone up by nearly half since 2008.\u00a0 The Indiana economy is growing, and we are selling to the world.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBut here\u2019s the hook \u2014 here\u2019s the hook: Nearly half of the exports from the state of Indiana go to Canada and Mexico.\u00a0 That\u2019s what makes this agreement so important.\u00a0 And it\u2019s really why I came home to talk about it.\u00a0 In fact, a quarter of all Indiana\u2019s manufacturing companies sell to Canada and Mexico what they make.\nI mean, we\u2019re just \u2014 we\u2019re not just the heart of the Heartland, we\u2019re not just the crossroads of America, we are situated between Canada and Mexico on major transportation arteries that Indiana businesses have taken tremendous advantage of over the years.\u00a0 And so, for Indiana, for the manufacturing industry, and for America, we\u2019ve got to get the USMCA done and we\u2019ve got to get it done this year.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nBecause for all of the progress that I was just talking about earlier in our economy and advancing the interest of America at home and abroad, that\u2019s just what this businessman-who-turned-President calls a \u201cgood start.\u201d\nThe truth is we need Congress to act, and to act this fall to approve the USMCA.\u00a0 But to make that happen, we need your help.\u00a0 Our elected representatives from here in Indiana need to hear from all of you.\nSo I want to encourage each and every one of you to go out and tell the story.\u00a0 Run into your neighbors and your friends.\u00a0 Stop people outside your place of worship or outside CVS.\u00a0 And just say, \u201cYou know, I ran into Mike the other day at MacAllister\u201d \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 \u201cand he was awfully excited about this USMCA thing.\u201d\u00a0 So I want you to go out there and tell our elected representatives in Washington, D.C., Indiana needs the USMCA.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI mean, tell them.\u00a0 Tell them it\u2019s going to level the playing field.\u00a0 Tell them this agreement is going to lead to more jobs and more investment in Indiana because it\u2019s the God\u2019s honest truth.\u00a0 It really is.\nBut the clock is ticking.\u00a0 So as you go out and reach out to your neighbors and friends, I want you to tell them: Reach out to the people that are going to be making this decision \u2014 our members of Congress and our senators.\nBut I can save you a nickel, okay?\u00a0 You don\u2019t need to call Senator Todd Young or Senator Mike Braun.\u00a0 They are leading the charge for the USMCA in the United States Senate.\u00a0 And I couldn\u2019t be more grateful.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nIn fact, you don\u2019t even need to call any Republicans representing Indiana in our nation\u2019s capital, in the House of Representatives, because they\u2019re all there.\u00a0 They\u2019re all on board.\u00a0 They know what trade means to Indiana.\u00a0 Trade means jobs in Indiana.\u00a0 That\u2019s what the USMCA is going to mean.\nBut if you have a minute \u2014 you know, I always had the view, when I was a member of Congress, that you represent everybody in Indiana and Washington.\u00a0 So if you have a minute, you might just call Congressman Andr\u00e9 Carson and Congressman Pete Visclosky and tell them to get off the dime and support the USMCA \u2014 (applause) \u2014 for Indiana and America.\u00a0 Seriously.\nI mean, you can tell Congressman Carson \u2014 who I served with on Capitol Hill; I served with his grandmother \u2014 and tell him the USMCA is a huge win for central Indiana.\u00a0 I mean, Eli Lilly and Company, which is headquartered right here in Indianapolis, exports nearly $500 million of products to Mexico and Canada every year, supporting about 10,000 jobs right here in central Indiana.\nSo tell Congressman Andr\u00e9 Carson you want him to put politics aside, put the USMCA on the floor, and pass it for Indiana this year.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And say it with a smile.\nYou know, the truth is, it was the greatest privilege of my life to represent our hometown in our nation\u2019s capital.\u00a0 And I can tell you what \u2014 I can tell you what: There\u2019s nothing that moves the Congress like the voice of the American people.\nAnd so I\u2019ve been literally travelling across the country and I wanted to come back home again to Indiana to make sure you let your voice be heard.\u00a0 Because I\u2019m absolutely convinced that if the people of this state and this nation send a clear message to Capitol Hill that we want the USMCA, Congress will get it done.\u00a0 So let\u2019s go get it done together, okay?\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSo thanks for coming out today to see me and my mom on this beautiful day.\nI want to thank MacAllister Machinery again for your hospitality and for slowing down your day to make us feel so welcome.\u00a0 Thank you, Chris.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nI\u2019m looking forward to saying hi to as many of you as time permits before I slip away.\u00a0 But, you know, being back home in Indiana is very special.\u00a0 My wife Karen is off helping raise some money for Riley Children\u2019s Hospital right now.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And I couldn\u2019t be more proud of her.\u00a0 Couldn\u2019t be more proud.\nAnd I\u2019ve got a busy couple of days ahead of me before we go back to our nation\u2019s capital that \u2014 you know, any time I\u2019m back in Indiana, I just have a heart filled with gratitude.\u00a0 You know, every opportunity I\u2019ve ever had to serve this nation, whether it be in our nation\u2019s capital or in our statehouse, is because of the confidence, the support, and prayers of the people of Indiana.\nSo let me just say to my fellow Hoosiers: Thank you for privilege of being your Vice President.\u00a0 It is the greatest honor of my life.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And I will always be grateful to the people of Indiana for the privilege to serve.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThank you.\u00a0 Thank you for that.\nYou know, these are challenging times in the life of our nation.\u00a0 It seems like, every day, politicians in Washington and their allies in the media seem to find new ways to divide this country.\u00a0 But, you know, I\u2019ve always believed that there will always be more that unites us in these United States of America than will ever divide us.\nAnd I\u2019ll make you a promise: Whatever they want to do in Congress to obstruct our agenda, or roll out their latest accusations against the President, or divide this country, President Donald Trump and I are never going to stop fighting for the policies and ideals that have made this country great again.\u00a0 That\u2019s my promise to everyone in Indiana.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nAnd I know with your continued support and prayers, with the strong support of Indiana\u2019s delegation, and the Congress of the United States, with the USMCA on the President\u2019s desk and signed, we\u2019re going to make this state and nation more prosperous than you can possibly imagine.\nAnd with President Donald Trump in the White House, and with God\u2019s help, we\u2019re going to keep America great.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThanks, everybody.\u00a0 God bless Indiana.\u00a0 God bless America.\u00a0 Let\u2019s go get the USMCA done.\nEND\n1:55 P.M. EDT\n"

EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Hello, everybody.\u00a0 I just watched a little bit of this on television.\u00a0 It\u2019s a disgrace to our country.\u00a0 It\u2019s another witch hunt.\u00a0 Here we go again.\u00a0 It\u2019s Adam Schiff and his crew making up stories and sitting there like pious whatever you want to call them.\u00a0 It\u2019s just a \u2014 really, it\u2019s a disgrace.\nIt\u2019s a terrible thing for our country.\u00a0 They can\u2019t do any work.\u00a0 They\u2019re frozen \u2014 the Democrats.\u00a0 They\u2019re going to lose the election; they know it.\u00a0 That\u2019s why they\u2019re doing it.\u00a0 And it should never be allowed, what\u2019s happened to this President.\nAnd despite that, I think I\u2019ve done just about more than any President in his first two and a half years in office.\u00a0 If you look, I think you\u2019ll see very few could compete with the things we\u2019ve done for our military, for the economy.\u00a0 We have the best economy anywhere in the world, by far.\u00a0 We\u2019ve rebuilt our military.\u00a0 We\u2019ve done so many things that are so incredible with tax cuts and regulations.\u00a0 And I have to put up with Adam Schiff on a per- \u2014 on an absolutely perfect phone call to the new President of Ukraine.\u00a0 That was a perfect call.\nBut Adam Schiff doesn\u2019t talk about Joe Biden and his son walking away with millions of dollars from Ukraine, and then millions of dollars from China.\u00a0 Walking away \u2014 in a quick meeting, walking away with millions of dollars.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t talk about Joe Biden firing a prosecutor, and if that prosecutor is not fired, he\u2019s not going to give him money from the United States of America.\u00a0 They don\u2019t talk about that.\nMy call was perfect.\u00a0 The President, yesterday, of Ukraine said there was no pressure put on him whatsoever.\u00a0 None whatsoever.\u00a0 And he said it loud and clear for the press.\u00a0 What these guys are doing \u2014 Democrats \u2014 are doing to this country is a disgrace and it shouldn\u2019t be allowed.\u00a0 There should be a way of stopping it \u2014 maybe legally, through the courts.\u00a0 But they\u2019re going to tie up our country.\u00a0 We can\u2019t talk about gun regulation.\u00a0 We can\u2019t talk about anything because, frankly, they\u2019re so tied up.\u00a0 They\u2019re so screwed up, nothing gets done \u2013except for when I do it.\nI\u2019m using Mexico to protect our border because the Democrats won\u2019t change loopholes and asylum.\u00a0 When you think of that \u2014 and I want to \u2014 I\u2019ll tell you, I want to thank Mexico.\u00a0 Twenty-seven thousand soldiers they have.\u00a0 But think of how bad that is \u2014 think of it \u2014 where we use Mexico because the Democrats won\u2019t fix our broken immigration system.\u00a0 We need their votes.\u00a0 If we don\u2019t get their votes, we can\u2019t do it.\nAnd the Republicans are all onboard.\u00a0 They want to fix it, but the Democrats won\u2019t do it.\u00a0 They don\u2019t want to talk about infrastructure.\u00a0 They don\u2019t want to talk about lowering drug prices.\u00a0 They don\u2019t want to talk about anything because they\u2019re fixated on this.\u00a0 And Nancy Pelosi has been hijacked by the radical left, and everybody knows it.\nThank you.\nEND\n1:03 P.M.

        "text": "InterContinental New York Barclay\nNew York, New York\n4:28 P.M. EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\nWell, thank you all for being here.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a tremendous three days in New York, at the United Nations.\u00a0 I want to thank the Secretary-General.\u00a0 It\u2019s been really incredible what\u2019s been taking place.\u00a0 And he\u2019s been a fantastic host to a lot of countries.\nThe meetings I had on a bilat, or close, were pretty staggering.\u00a0 I think we set a new record, but you\u2019ll have to check that out.\u00a0 The \u2014 we met very, very \u2014 for pretty extended periods of time, either two and two, one on one, or just about at that level with Pakistan, Poland, New Zealand, Singapore, Egypt, South Korea, United Kingdom, India, Iraq, Argentina, Germany, Brazil, France, Japan, Ukraine, Honduras, El Salvador, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, UAE, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.\u00a0 Other than that, we weren\u2019t too busy over the last three days.\nAnd, unfortunately, the press doesn\u2019t even cover it.\u00a0 You know, we have \u2014 we\u2019ve made some fantastic deals, like with Japan.\u00a0 For farmers, we have a tremendous trade deal with Japan.\u00a0 And that doesn\u2019t get covered because you waste your time on nonsense.\nThe PMI manufacturers\u2019 index has gone substantially up, which was an incredible \u2014 Larry Kudlow, wherever you may be \u2014 Larry, please stand up.\u00a0 He just gave me these numbers.\u00a0 And existing new home sales are through the roof.\u00a0 Just came out.\u00a0 Oil prices have gone down ever since the Saudi Arabia incident, and they\u2019ve gone down very substantially.\u00a0 So, we have plenty of oil.\u00a0 But those numbers were surprising to you, Larry.\u00a0 And the extent of the increase.\u00a0 Is that a correct statement?\u00a0 So thank you, Larry Kudlow.\nWe think we\u2019ll make this little announcement to you because \u2014 important.\u00a0 You know the so-called whistleblower?\u00a0 The one that didn\u2019t have any first-class, or first-rate, or second-tier information, from what I understand.\u00a0 You\u2019ll have to figure that out for yourself.\u00a0 But I\u2019ve spoken with Leader Kevin McCarthy and the Republicans \u2014 many of them \u2014 and we were going to do this anyway, but I\u2019ve informed them \u2014 all of the House members \u2014 that I fully support transparency on the so-called whistleblower information, even though it was supposedly second-hand information, which is sort of interesting.\nAnd other things have come out about the whistleblower that are also maybe even more interesting.\u00a0 But also insist on transparency from Joe Biden and his son Hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China.\u00a0 Millions of dollars.\u00a0 Millions and millions of dollars taken out very rapidly while he was Vice President.\u00a0 And I think they should have transparency for that.\u00a0 I\u2019ve informed the Leader about that.\nAnd additionally, I demand transparency from Democrats who went to Ukraine and attempted to force the new President, who I met and is an outstanding person.\u00a0 I just met a little while ago; some of you were there.\u00a0 I think he\u2019s going to be outstanding.\u00a0 He got elected on the basis of corruption.\u00a0 He wants to end corruption in Ukraine, and I think that\u2019s great.\nBut they went there and they wanted to force the new President to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat.\u00a0 They threatened him if he didn\u2019t do things.\u00a0 Now, that\u2019s what they\u2019re accusing me of, but I didn\u2019t do it.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t threaten anybody.\u00a0 In fact, the press was asking questions of the President of Ukraine.\u00a0 And he said, \u201cNo pressure.\u201d\u00a0 I used the word \u201cpressure.\u201d\u00a0 I think he used the word \u201cpush,\u201d but he meant pressure, but it\u2019s the same thing.\u00a0 No push, no pressure, no nothing.\u00a0 It\u2019s all a hoax, folks.\u00a0 It\u2019s all a big hoax.\nAnd the sad thing about this hoax is that we work so hard with all of these countries \u2014 and I mean really hard.\u00a0 This has been \u2014 I\u2019ve been up from early in the morning to late in the evening, and meeting with different countries all for the good of our country, and the press doesn\u2019t even cover all of this.\u00a0 And it\u2019s disappearing \u2014 it\u2019s really disappointing also to those countries that are with us and spend so much time with us.\nSo, we want transparency.\u00a0 We\u2019ve informed Kevin McCarthy about transparency.\u00a0 And we said, \u201cVote for it.\u201d\u00a0 So I think you\u2019ll have close to 100 percent of the Republican votes, I hope.\nAnd it got almost no attention, but in May, CNN reported that Senators Robert Menendez, Richard Durbin, and Patrick Leahy wrote a letter to Ukraine\u2019s Prosecutor General expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were \u201ccritical.\u201d\u00a0 In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake and that if they didn\u2019t do the right thing, they wouldn\u2019t get any assistance.\u00a0 Gee, doesn\u2019t that sound familiar?\u00a0 Doesn\u2019t that sound familiar?\nAnd Chris Murphy \u2014 who I\u2019ve been dealing with on guns \u2014 you know, so nice.\u00a0 He\u2019s always, \u201cOh, no, we want to work it out.\u00a0 We want to work it out.\u201d\u00a0 But they\u2019re too busy wasting their time on the witch hunt.\u00a0 So, Senator Chris Murphy literally threatened the President of Ukraine that, if he doesn\u2019t do things right, they won\u2019t have Democrat support in Congress.\u00a0 So you\u2019re going to look all of this up.\nOne other thing \u2014 I\u2019m just going off of certain notes and elements of what we\u2019ve been doing over the last three days, but this just came up a few minutes ago: The \u201cAmazon-Washington Post\u201d just put out a fake article that Acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire \u2014 who I\u2019ve gotten to know, and he\u2019s a tough cookie \u2014 and I was surprised; I was shocked to hear this \u2014 was going to quit, blaming the White House for something that they wouldn\u2019t let him talk openly, freely.\u00a0 And I was shocked because I know Joe, and he\u2019s tough.\u00a0 A tough guy.\nAnd I was really surprised to hear he was going to quit.\u00a0 Before I could even either talk to him or talk to anybody else, he put out a statement \u2014 I didn\u2019t speak to Joe yet \u2014 but he said, \u201cAt no time have I considered resigning my position.\u201d\u00a0 In other words, the story in the Washington Post was a fake.\n\u201cAt no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role on August 16, 2019.\u00a0 I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now.\u00a0 I\u2019m committed to leading the intelligence community to address the diverse and complex threats facing our nation.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s from the Acting Director of National Intelligence, a very good man, Joseph Maguire.\nSo we\u2019re having a great period of time.\u00a0 Our country is the strongest it\u2019s ever been economically.\u00a0 Our numbers are phenomenal.\u00a0 Wilbur, thank you.\u00a0 And Larry.\u00a0 Everybody.\u00a0 The numbers are phenomenal.\u00a0 Our economy is the strongest in the world.\u00a0 We\u2019re the largest economy in the world.\nHad my opponent won, we would be second right now because China was catching us so rapidly, we would\u2019ve been second by this time.\u00a0 And unless somebody does a very poor job as President, we\u2019re going to be first for a long way, because we\u2019ve picked up trillions and trillions of dollars in value and worth of our country, and China has lost trillions and trillions of dollars, and millions of jobs, and their supply chain.\u00a0 And they want to make a deal.\nThis year, America came to the United Nations stronger than we have ever been before: Since my election, the United States has not only brought our economy to a level that we have never seen, the most jobs that we\u2019ve ever had \u2014 you know you\u2019ve heard me say it many times \u2014 African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, the best unemployment numbers we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 And the most and best employment numbers: 160 million \u2014 very close to that number \u2014 in jobs.\u00a0 We\u2019ve never been anywhere close.\nWages are up, and inequality is down.\u00a0 Something that people don\u2019t like writing about.\u00a0 But wages are up.\u00a0 I used to speak during the campaign, and I\u2019d talk about wages where people were making less money three years ago than they were making 21 years, 22 years ago, and they\u2019d have two jobs and three jobs.\u00a0 When I say \u201cthree years ago,\u201d I\u2019m talking into the area sometime prior to the election.\u00a0 And they were doing very badly.\u00a0 And now, for the first time in many years, wages are up and employment is up, and unemployment is down.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a beautiful thing to watch.\nIn a week of active and ambitious diplomacy here at the United Nations, America renewed our friendships.\u00a0 We advanced our values greatly and made clear to everyone that the United States will always defend our citizens to promote prosperity.\nI met with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, at length, of the United Kingdom, continuing our discussions on a magnificent, new bilateral trade deal.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll see what happens with respect to Brexit, but I suspect we\u2019ll have a fantastic deal with the UK. It should be much bigger than it has been over the last number of years.\u00a0 Over the last 20 years, frankly.\u00a0 It should be a much bigger deal.\nThat\u2019s true with many countries.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to have much bigger trade deals with a lot of countries that have an opportunity to come.\u00a0 And they all want to do business with the United States, especially now.\nEarlier today, I stood alongside Prime Minister Abe of Japan \u2014 a friend of mine, a great gentleman.\u00a0 Had a great reelection.\u00a0 And we signed a terrific new trade deal, which tremendously helps our farmers and ranchers, and technology.\u00a0 The technology companies are really big beneficiaries.\nWe also held very productive conversations with leaders of Pakistan, India.\u00a0 And many other nations are achieving stronger ties of fair and reciprocal trade.\u00a0 And with respect to Pakistan and India, we talked about Kashmir.\u00a0 And whatever help I can be, I said \u2014 I offered, whether it\u2019s arbitration or mediation, or whatever it has to be, I\u2019ll do whatever I can.\u00a0 Because they\u2019re at very serious odds right now, and hopefully that\u2019ll get better.\nYou look at the two gentlemen heading those two countries \u2014 two good friends of mine \u2014 I said, \u201cFellas, work it out.\u00a0 Just work it out.\u201d\u00a0 Those are two nuclear countries.\u00a0 They\u2019ve got to work it out.\nThis week, we also made incredible strides on national security with President Duda of Poland.\u00a0 We signed a joint declaration advancing defense cooperation.\u00a0 And, crucially, Poland has agreed to put up 100 percent of the money \u2014 something I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever heard said before.\u00a0 But they\u2019re going to put up 100 percent of the money, of hosting additional U.S. military personnel that we\u2019ll be taking from various other countries.\u00a0 We won\u2019t have more over; we\u2019ll have \u2014 we\u2019ll be moving them around.\nPoland is building us phenomenal new facilities.\u00a0 They\u2019re spending everything, and they\u2019re going to really do a job.\u00a0 But we\u2019ll be moving a few thousand soldiers, and Poland will be paying that for it.\nTogether with Prime Minister Lee of Singapore, I signed an important agreement extending our defense cooperation.\u00a0 This hasn\u2019t been changed in many years.\u00a0 Then, yesterday, I met with prospective members of the Middle East Strategic Alliance, which is a group that I know very well; I know all of them.\u00a0 And through this effort, the nations of the Middle East are taking more responsibility for securing their own future and their own neighborhood.\u00a0 And they\u2019re also reimbursing us and paying us for a lot of the military work that we incredibly do.\nBut because we\u2019re now independent, energy-wise \u2014 we\u2019re energy independent \u2014 we have very few boats going over the Middle East.\u00a0 We used to have them going through the Straits all the time.\u00a0 And you probably noticed that, every once in a while, they go after somebody else\u2019s.\u00a0 They haven\u2019t gone after ours yet. If they do, they\u2019ve get big problems.\u00a0 But we have very few boats going over there.\u00a0 They were saying the other day, they\u2019ve never attacked an American boat, and I\u2019m not asking for trouble.\u00a0 But if they do, they know they have far bigger trouble.\u00a0 But then they said, \u201cBut, you know, we don\u2019t see very many American boats over here anymore.\u201d\nThis week also brought extraordinary progress to nations of our own hemisphere.\u00a0 In recent days, we\u2019ve achieved historic asylum cooperation agreements with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.\u00a0 We were with El Salvador today.\u00a0 A great young gentleman became the President.\u00a0 He\u2019s strong and tough, and he\u2019s taking care of crime.\u00a0 He was really something today.\u00a0 I was very impressed with him.\u00a0 And likewise with Honduras, who we met.\u00a0 We signed a cooperation agreement with both, and also with Guatemala.\nWe\u2019re working with our partners in Central America to ensure that asylum-seekers can pursue relief as close to their home countries as possible.\u00a0 That\u2019ll make a tremendous difference at our southern border.\nAnd Mexico \u2014 I have to say, President Lopez Obrador has been outstanding \u2014 an outstanding partner.\u00a0 And he\u2019s doing a great job in Mexico.\u00a0 The cartels are way down, and the numbers \u2014 our Secretary is here now \u2014 the numbers are way down.\u00a0 Way, way down.\u00a0 And we\u2019re doing that without the help of Congress, meaning the Democrats in Congress who won\u2019t give us a single vote to take care of loopholes.\nWe have loopholes that are so horrible, and it would be so easy to fix.\u00a0 And they know they should be fixed but they don\u2019t want to do because they don\u2019t want to give Trump any credit because it\u2019s all about the election.\u00a0 That\u2019s all they care about.\u00a0 They don\u2019t care about our country; they care about the election.\nAnd the sad part is, with all of the tremendous work that we\u2019ve done this weekend \u2014 whether it\u2019s Secretary Mnuchin or Secretary Pompeo, who had some outstanding, outstanding meetings \u2014 with all of this tremendous work that we\u2019ve done, the press doesn\u2019t even cover it.\u00a0 And the Democrats did this hoax during the United Nations week.\u00a0 It was perfect.\u00a0 Because this way, it takes away from these tremendous achievements that we\u2019re taking care of doing, that we\u2019re involved in in New York City, at the United Nations.\nSo that was all planned, like everything else.\u00a0 It was all planned.\u00a0 And the witch hunt continues, but they\u2019re getting hit hard in this witch hunt, because when they look at the information, it\u2019s a joke.\u00a0 Impeachment?\u00a0 For that?\u00a0 When you have a wonderful meeting, or you have a wonderful phone conversation?\nI think you should ask.\u00a0 We actually \u2014 you know, that was the second conversation.\u00a0 I think you should ask for the first conversation also.\u00a0 I can\u2019t believe they haven\u2019t, although I heard there\u2019s a \u2014 there\u2019s a rumor out they want the first conversation.\u00a0 It was beautiful.\u00a0 It was just a perfect conversation.\nBut I think you should do that.\u00a0 I think you should do, and I think you should ask for VP Pence\u2019s conversation because he had a couple conversations also.\u00a0 I can save you a lot of time.\u00a0 They\u2019re all perfect.\u00a0 Nothing was mentioned of any import other than congratulations.\u00a0 But the word is that they\u2019re going to ask for the first phone conversation.\u00a0 You can have it anytime you need it.\u00a0 And also Mike Pence\u2019s conversations, which were, I think, one or two of them.\u00a0 They were perfect.\u00a0 They were all perfect.\nIt\u2019s very sad what the Democrats are doing to this country. They\u2019re dividing.\u00a0 They\u2019re belittling.\u00a0 They\u2019re demeaning our country.\u00a0 So many leaders came up to me today and they said, \u201cSir, what you go through, no President has ever gone through.\u00a0 And it\u2019s so bad for your country.\u201d\u00a0 People laugh at the stupidity of what they\u2019ve asked for.\u00a0 And here we could do asylum.\u00a0 We could do all of these different things so easily.\u00a0 We could do asylum quickly.\u00a0 We could do loopholes; get rid of them.\nInstead, we actually made deals with Mexico and with Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras.\u00a0 And we\u2019re doing it with them instead of with our Congress, but we\u2019re doing it.\u00a0 We get it done.\nThe wall is being built, by the way.\u00a0 It got little coverage.\u00a0 I went to the border.\u00a0 It\u2019s going up in New Mexico.\u00a0 It\u2019s going up in Arizona.\u00a0 It\u2019s going up in California, believe it or not.\u00a0 They really wanted that wall in California, in San Diego.\u00a0 As soon as it was completed, they said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want a wall.\u201d\u00a0 They were begging me for a wall.\u00a0 I should take it out and move it to another location.\nWe were with the Governor \u2014 spoke to him a lot \u2014 but the Governor of Texas, Lieutenant Governor of Texas, Attorney General of Texas, the senators of Texas \u2014 Cornyn, Ted Cruz.\u00a0 And we\u2019re building an incredible wall.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to \u2014 number one, it\u2019s going to look great.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be virtually impossible to cross unless you\u2019re one hell of a mountain climber.\u00a0 It\u2019s very tough.\u00a0 It\u2019s going to be very tough to get people and drugs over those walls, because they\u2019re the real deal.\nI went to the Secretary of Homeland security, and he got all his people together.\u00a0 I said, \u201cGive me four walls \u2014 your optimum.\u00a0 Every single thing included.\u201d\u00a0 And they give me 20 percent less, 20 percent less, and 20 percent less \u2014 meaning, less cost.\u00a0 They came back, they said, \u201cThis is the wall, sir.\u00a0 This would be the best.\u201d\u00a0 We have the panels on top, which are anti-climb panels.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if you noticed the steel on top.\u00a0 We have a different design for a different area, but this anti-climb is very tough.\u00a0 They\u2019ve \u2014 we had people going out and real climbers telling us which is the toughest to climb.\u00a0 But these are anti-climb panels.\u00a0 Very tough to get across.\nAnd the wall is going up, many miles a week.\u00a0 And we hope to have over 400, but maybe as much as 500 miles, which we\u2019ll pretty much do it because you have a lot of natural barriers; you have mountains, you have really rough rivers.\u00a0 You have some really rough land that you can\u2019t cross very easily.\u00a0 So they serve as their natural walls.\u00a0 But we \u2014 we\u2019ll have, we think, over 400, but we could even have 500 miles.\nTo combat the malice, corruption of both the Venezuelan and Iranian dictatorships, today I issued proclamations suspending the entry into the United States of senior regime officials and their families.\nAnd further, to promote American values, on Monday I was proud to be the first President in history to host a meeting at the United Nations \u2014\nI\u2019m so surprised; first President for this.\u00a0 I can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m first.\u00a0 I spoke to Franklin Graham about that.\u00a0 I can\u2019t believe it.\n\u2014 at the United Nations, on protecting religious freedom and liberty for people around the world.\nWhile some partisans and unelected bureaucrats in Washington may choose to fight every day against the interests and beliefs of the American people, my administration is standing up for the American people like no administration has in many, many years.\u00a0 You forgot the American people.\u00a0 You totally forgot the American people.\nThis week, every \u2014 every week, I really can say \u2014 of my presidency, we\u2019re standing up for American prosperity, American security, and the American way of life.\u00a0 And together, with our friends and partners, we\u2019re building a more peaceful, prosperous, and promising future.\nWe have a tremendous relationship now with a lot of nations that are very happy with what\u2019s going on, and that includes in South America, where they\u2019ve been so helpful, where nobody thought this would be possible.\u00a0 The relationship with Mexico is an example, or El Salvador, or Honduras, or Guatemala.\u00a0 Nobody even knew about it.\u00a0 Yet, we sent them hundreds of millions of dollars, and all we got back was caravans of people pouring in.\nWe had tremendous \u2014 we had tremendous \u2014 it was terrible.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve got that stopped, and the countries are now helping us.\u00a0 And we stopped those payments, by the way.\u00a0 We don\u2019t pay those countries that money anymore.\u00a0 But I will tell you, if they\u2019re as good as they seem to be \u2014 they\u2019re really doing a job on crime and stopping the wrong people from leaving and coming to the United States \u2014 we\u2019ll be helping them a lot with economic development projects and other things.\nSo, with that, we had a tremendous three days.\u00a0 It was beautiful to see.\u00a0 Made a lot of new friends.\u00a0 I read you a list of all the countries I saw pretty much one on one.\u00a0 And it\u2019s been very busy, but it\u2019s been very, very fruitful.\nSo we could take a couple of questions. I\u2019d love some questions on some of the things that we accomplished at UNGA, instead of the witch hunt \u2014 the phony witch hunt questions, which I know that\u2019s what you want to ask because it\u2019s probably better for you, but it\u2019s not better for the country.\nSo maybe we\u2019ll take a few \u2014 a few questions.\u00a0 Please.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 You suggested that you didn\u2019t do anything wrong in the course of your conversations with the Ukrainian President.\u00a0 But can you explain to the American people why it is appropriate for an American President to ask a foreign leader for information about a political rival, and what you would have said if you discovered that Barack Obama perhaps had asked a foreign leader for information about you before your campaign for the presidency?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Well, that\u2019s what he did, isn\u2019t it, really?\u00a0 When you think about it.\nLook, that whole witch hunt was started, and hopefully that\u2019ll all come out.\u00a0 But there\u2019s been some fantastic books written that just came out \u2014 whether you will look at Gregg Jarrett, or McCarthy\u2019s book that just \u2014 just came out recently, and so many other books.\u00a0 And a lot of books are coming out. When you start reading those books, you see what they did to us.\u00a0 What they\u2019ve done to this country is a disgrace.\u00a0 They\u2019ve hurt this country very badly.\u00a0 And no other President should have to go through what I\u2019ve gone through.\nThe President \u2014 the new President of Ukraine is looking to stop corruption.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot of corruption going on, and there was corruption.\u00a0 I just told you about senators that threatened him with votes and no money coming into Ukraine if they do things.\u00a0 That\u2019s really what people are trying to say that I did, but the only difference is I didn\u2019t do it.\u00a0 You take a look at that call; it was perfect.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t do it.\u00a0 There was no quid pro quo, but there was with Biden and there was with these senators.\u00a0 And they threatened.\u00a0 They said, \u201cYou do this, you do that.\u00a0 We\u2019re not going to give you votes.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the real deal.\nSo we have an honest group of people that have been maligned.\u00a0 And, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 a lot of people say I\u2019ll do even better.\u00a0 I\u2019m very happy.\u00a0 Yesterday, I guess we had a 53 poll, and a lot of people say add 10 points to anything.\u00a0 Anybody voting for Trump, you can add \u2014 anytime you get a poll, you can add 10 points or 7 points or 6 points.\u00a0 Take it any way you want.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t know if I consider that to be a compliment, but in one way it is a compliment.\nAnd I guess that\u2019s what happened in the last election: Far more people came to vote than anybody thought possible.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So why should the American people then be comfortable with an American President asking a foreign leader for information about an American citizen?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I think you can look at your senators and you can look at Biden, and you can look at all these other people.\u00a0 But what we\u2019re looking for is corruption.\u00a0 An investigation started, called the \u201cRussian witch hunt,\u201d affectionately.\u00a0 And it was a total phony scam.\u00a0 It was set up by people within the government to try and stop somebody from getting elected.\nAnd after that person \u2014 namely, me \u2014 won, and convincingly won at 306 to 223 in the Electoral College \u2014 which, by the way, when you run a race, if you\u2019re running electoral \u2014 you know, if you go by the College, Electoral College, that\u2019s a much different race than running popular vote.\u00a0 And it\u2019s like the hundred-yard dash or the mile.\u00a0 You train differently.\nAnd I can\u2019t help it that my opponent didn\u2019t go to Wisconsin and should have gone much more to Michigan and Pennsylvania and other places.\u00a0 But that\u2019s the way it is.\u00a0 We won election, convincingly.\u00a0 Convincingly.\u00a0 And then you had the text message on, \u201cWell, if she doesn\u2019t win, we\u2019ve got an insurance policy.\u201d How bad was that?\u00a0 You know the insurance policy?\u00a0 That\u2019s sort of what has been taking place over the last number of years \u2014 the insurance policy.\nNo, there are a lot of very dishonest people.\u00a0 We\u2019re the ones that played it straight.\u00a0 And you know what?\u00a0 The millions of people out there that are looking at what\u2019s going on \u2014 those people understand it.\u00a0 They see it.\u00a0 And they think it\u2019s disgusting.\u00a0 And our people are being hurt, and our country is being hurt.\nWhen Nancy Pelosi allows her position to be taken over by radical far-left socialists, or worse, that\u2019s pretty bad.\u00a0 That\u2019s pretty bad \u2014 especially when the senators and all of these other people have actually done what they\u2019re accusing me of doing, which I didn\u2019t do.\nI\u2019m going to have Mike Pompeo say a couple of words.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to have Steve Mnuchin say a couple of words.\u00a0 And then we\u2019ll do a couple of more questions.\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\u00a0 Mr. President, I thought I\u2019d start by talking about Iran.\u00a0 We had a productive week.\u00a0 We saw the Europeans take a position with respect to the attacks that took place in Saudi Arabia, making clear this was Iran, just as President Trump and I had been saying, and have now joined us in saying that the existing JCPOA framework is not going to work, it\u2019s not going to solve the world\u2019s problems, it\u2019s not going to create Middle East stability.\nThen we had a good set of meetings with our Middle East allies as well.\u00a0 The President joined for a meeting of the GCC where we talked again about how we can help deter.\u00a0 We want peace.\u00a0 We want a peaceful resolution with the Islamic Republic of Iran.\u00a0 We\u2019re hoping we can get that way.\u00a0 In the end, it\u2019ll be up to the Iranians to make that decision, whether they\u2019ll choose violence and hate \u2014 and the President said in his speech yesterday to the General Assembly \u2014 if their bloodthirst will continue.\nWe hope that\u2019s the (inaudible).\u00a0 We hope we can get the opportunity to negotiate with them and get an outcome that\u2019s good for both of them, for the United States, to make sure that they never have a nuclear weapon and that they can\u2019t foment their terror with ballistic missiles and in the way they have all around the world.\u00a0 And I think we made real progress uniting the world on that here over these past few days.\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Thank you.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:\u00a0 As Secretary Pompeo said on Iran, we had very good discussions with all of our allies about the sanctions program, which is the maximum pressure, and unity on the sanctions program.\u00a0 The Europeans made it very clear they would not do anything without our consent.\nAnd then, on the economic front, we had the entire economic team here for all the meetings: Secretary Ross, Larry Kudlow; Ambassador Lighthizer just left to go back to D.C.\u00a0 He\u2019s working hard on trying to get USMCA passed.\u00a0 But we had a lot of productive discussions.\u00a0 The Japanese trade deal and a lot of discussions on investing in the U.S., more jobs in the U.S., and more trade.\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Go ahead, please.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Kristina Partsinevelos, Fox Business.\u00a0 I want to focus on markets, because I\u2019ll leave it to everybody else to talk about impeachment.\u00a0 Markets reacted positively after you spoke about China, and that it would happen sooner than \u2014 rather than unexpectedly.\nYet, you have the Foreign Minister of China saying that they have no intention of, you know, unseating the United States.\u00a0 And yet, they\u2019re investing heavily in infrastructure and military.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Not anymore, maybe.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But what \u2014 what is different this time, though?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 And maybe they just say that, Kristina.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What is different this time, though?\u00a0 The fact that you\u2019re saying it\u2019s progressing.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Oh, I just think it\u2019s progressing.\u00a0 I think they want to make a deal.\u00a0 They\u2019re losing their supply chain.\u00a0 You know, it\u2019s getting killed.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you have something specific?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Well, I don\u2019t want to say that.\u00a0 But I can tell you that these two men \u2014 and, in this case, more specifically, Steve, we\u2019re having some very good conversations.\nAnd I guess it\u2019s next week that a group is coming in and the week after.\u00a0 So we have a lot of \u2014 we have a lot of talks going on, and also by telephone.\nThey want to make a deal.\u00a0 And you know why they want to make a deal?\u00a0 Because they\u2019re losing their jobs, and because their supply chain is going to hell.\u00a0 And companies are moving out of China, and they\u2019re moving to lots of other places, including the United States.\u00a0 And that\u2019s not good; that\u2019s far worse than they thought.\nAnd, by the way, in the meantime, we\u2019re taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs.\u00a0 We\u2019re taking in tremendous numbers in tariffs.\u00a0 And we\u2019re helping our farmers who got targeted.\u00a0 Now, by the way, China is starting to buy our agricultural product again.\u00a0 They\u2019re starting to go with the beef and all of the different things \u2014 pork.\u00a0 Very big on pork.\nBut if you look and if you see \u2014 and they actually put out, I think, a statement.\u00a0 But they\u2019re starting, very heavy, to buy our ag again.\u00a0 No, they want to make a deal.\u00a0 And they should want to make a deal.\u00a0 The question is: Do we want to make a deal?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0 If USMCA doesn\u2019t pass through Congress, is that it for NAFTA?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, that would be a shame.\u00a0 Well, I don\u2019t want to answer that question, but you know how I feel about NAFTA.\u00a0 I think NAFTA is the worst trade deal ever made, although I also happen to think World Trade Organization was not one of the greats.\u00a0 Not one of the greats.\u00a0 That was the creation of China, which went like a rocket ship from the day they signed.\u00a0 It was \u2014 it was terrible.\nBut, no, we\u2019re going to find out.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to be a very interesting question, with Nancy and Chuck and all of these people focusing on the witch hunt because they can\u2019t beat us at the ballot.\u00a0 They can\u2019t beat us at the ballot.\u00a0 And they\u2019re not going to win the presidential.\u00a0 We\u2019re having great polls.\u00a0 We have internal polls that are \u2014 Ohio, Iowa.\u00a0 Pennsylvania is looking good.\u00a0 North Carolina.\nWe just won two races that a lot of people \u2014 we thought we were going to lose both of those races.\u00a0 One was down 17 points three weeks before the race, and he ended up winning by a substantial margin \u2014 by a substantial margin.\u00a0 And \u2014 Dan Bishop.\nAnd then we had a second race, as you know, and he was up one or two points and ended up winning by \u2014 what was it?\u00a0 Twenty-five points or some incredible \u2014 I\u2019ll ask you folks because I don\u2019t want to be inaccurate.\u00a0 Otherwise, I\u2019ll have a front-page story: \u201cWe have breaking news.\u00a0 Trump exaggerated.\u201d\nBut he won by many, many points.\u00a0 And he was leading by maybe two, maybe three, but he won by \u2014 in the twenties.\u00a0 So it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s been \u2014 so we\u2019re looking great in North Carolina, looking great in Florida.\nAnd you had one or two congressmen Democrats say, \u201cListen, we can\u2019t beat them at the election, so let\u2019s impeach him.\u201d\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 Didn\u2019t you hear \u2014 Al Green.\u00a0 That\u2019s a beauty.\u00a0 He\u2019s a real beauty, that guy.\u00a0 But he said, very distinctively, it\u2019s all \u2014 it was all over the place.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know \u2014 they\u2019re trying to lose that tape, I guess.\nBut he said, \u201cWe can\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u00a0 Essentially, he said, \u201cWe can\u2019t beat him.\u00a0 Let\u2019s impeach him.\u201d\u00a0 That\u2019s pretty \u2014 that\u2019s pretty dangerous stuff.\nSteve, go ahead.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, sir.\u00a0 You had expressed some concerns about the precedent of releasing the transcript.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 I don\u2019t like it.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why did you go ahead and do it?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Because I was getting such fake news, and I just thought it would be better.\u00a0 And now they\u2019re asking for the first phone conversation, and I\u2019ll release that too, if it\u2019s important to you.\u00a0 But they\u2019re asking for \u2014 because I had a conversation previous \u2014 on a previous election plateau that he had hit.\u00a0 The \u2014 the current president hit a couple of different plateaus. \u00a0And I spoke to him, previous to the call that we released, which was a very innocent call \u2014 very, very innocent; very nice call.\nAnd as he said, we were \u2014 \u201cI wasn\u2019t pushed.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t pushed,\u201d meaning pressured.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t pressured at all.\nBut I don\u2019t like the concept of releasing calls because when a president or prime minister, or a king or a queen, calls the United States, you don\u2019t like to say, \u201cGee, we\u2019re going to release your call to the fake-news media, and they\u2019re going to make you look like a fool.\u201d\u00a0 What happens is, it\u2019s hard to do business that way.\u00a0 You want to have people feel comfortable.\nSo I hated it, but you folks were saying such lies, such horrible things about a call that was so innocent and so nice.\u00a0 In fact, Lindsey Graham said to me, when he read it \u2014 it was very interesting.\u00a0 He\u2019s a good man.\u00a0 He\u2019s a smart man.\u00a0 He said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u00a0 I never knew you could be this, really, nice to a person.\u201d\u00a0 He said, \u201cI cannot believe it.\u00a0 You were so nice.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t think you had that in you to be so nice.\u201d\nI was nice.\u00a0 I\u2019m nice to a lot of people.\u00a0 People don\u2019t understand that.\u00a0 But I was.\u00a0 But he was shocked that it was such a nice call.\u00a0 There \u2014 he said, \u201cThere is nothing here.\u201d\u00a0 And all fair people say the same thing.\nBut I don\u2019t like the precedent, Steve.\u00a0 I don\u2019t like it where you\u2019re dealing with heads of state and to think that their call is going to be released.\u00a0 But I felt that \u2014 and, you know, we spoke to Ukraine about it.\u00a0 Mike actually called up his counterpart, and we spoke to Ukraine about it because we want to \u2014 because they could have been \u2014 if that they didn\u2019t want us to do it, we would not have done it.\nBut he actually said, \u201cThat was a very innocent call.\u00a0 You can release it all you want.\u201d\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And are you now braced for long impeachment saga?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I thought we won.\u00a0 I thought it was dead.\u00a0 It was dead.\u00a0 The Mueller report \u2014 no obstruction, no collusion.\u00a0 You look at all of the things that happened.\nCorey Lewandowski was fantastic the other day, as a person that they have been tormenting.\u00a0 You look at all the people that they\u2019ve tormented, all the legal fees.\u00a0 People came here with bright eyes; they wanted to make life so great for other people.\u00a0 And they left where they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees that they didn\u2019t have.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a sad thing.\u00a0 What these Democrats have done to ruin lives is so sad.\nI\u2019ve seen people with only good intention.\u00a0 They came to Washington because they wanted to make the United States and the world a better place.\u00a0 And they went home \u2014 they were dark.\u00a0 They got hit by Mueller\u2019s subpoenas.\u00a0 I think there were 2,500 subpoenas, or some ridiculous number.\u00a0 Five hundred people were interviewed, and yet, they don\u2019t interview Joe Biden and his son.\nIf you\u2019re Democrat, you have automatic protection.\u00a0 That\u2019s years and years of people putting in certain people into positions.\u00a0 But when you look at all of the \u2014 all of the trauma that these fakers, of course \u2014 and the press \u2014 look, the press is \u2014 much of the press is not only fake, it\u2019s corrupt.\u00a0 These stories they write are corrupt; they\u2019re so wrong.\u00a0 And they know that.\nYou know, it used to be \u2014 I used to get great press until I ran for politics.\u00a0 I mean, I used to be the king of getting good press.\u00a0 I was very good at it.\u00a0 And I got good.\u00a0 I mean, they covered me well for what \u2014 otherwise, I probably wouldn\u2019t be here.\nAnd once I ran, I said, \u201cBoy, this is incredible.\u201d\u00a0 But if you see the way they treat my family \u2014 used to be treated great.\u00a0 My family worked so hard.\u00a0 The people that work with me \u2014 these people \u2014 all of these people, they work so hard.\u00a0 They\u2019ve done such a good \u2014\nLook, we have the greatest economy we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 We have a military \u2014 two and a half trillion dollars.\u00a0 We\u2019ve rebuilt our military.\u00a0 You don\u2019t hear the vets complaining.\u00a0 We got Choice approved.\u00a0 It couldn\u2019t be approved.\nBut when you see what happened with the viciousness, and when you see little Adam Schiff go out and lie and lie and stand at the mic \u2014 smart guy, by the way \u2014 stand at the mic and act like he\u2019s so serious.\u00a0 And then he goes into a room with Nadler, and they must laugh their asses off.\u00a0 They must laugh their asses off.\nBut it\u2019s so bad for our country.\u00a0 People have said \u2014 Rush Limbaugh \u2014 great man; Sean Hannity said it.\u00a0 A lot of people have said it.\u00a0 Mark Levin.\u00a0 They said they don\u2019t know if one man anywhere in the world, with all the men they know \u2014 or woman \u2014 that could handle what I\u2019ve had to handle.\nAnd I think that\u2019s true, but I handle it.\u00a0 To me, it\u2019s like putting on a suit.\nAll right, how about one more question?\u00a0 A question on the economy.\u00a0 A question on the economy.\nGo ahead.\u00a0 Go ahead.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hi, Mr. President.\u00a0 VPItv from Venezuela \u2014 Caracas, Venezuela.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Wow.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 How are you doing?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We made it.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 How are you doing over there?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pretty bad.\u00a0 Our situation is pretty bad.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 I would say \u201cpretty bad.\u201d\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Sad.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 But we are fighting.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 And it was one of the great countries and one of the richest countries not so long ago \u2014 15 years ago.\u00a0 It\u2019s incredible.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But we are going to make it.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 I agree with that.\u00a0 And we\u2019re helping you.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 We\u2019re helping you.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah, I know.\u00a0 And thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Go ahead.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I have two questions \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Go ahead.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 to take advantage of this.\u00a0 Maduro traveled to Russia and Diosdado Cabello to North Korea \u2014 two of the most antagonist nations in the U.S. interests.\u00a0 What can be done to contain this?\u00a0 What are they looking for in that country?\u00a0 And because the special envoy, Mr. Abrams, said that the Russians are willing to negotiate it.\u00a0 This is one question.\nAnd the other: Mr. President, you say that the socialists is one of the biggest challenges, you said yesterday in the United Nations.\u00a0 But the region is far from safe.\u00a0 Maduro is still a dictator, full in power.\u00a0 (Inaudible) in Argentina and Brazil are on their (inaudible) about the socialist and populist.\u00a0 Are you worried about it?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I just say that socialism will never happen in the United States.\u00a0 It can\u2019t happen in the United States.\u00a0 And Venezuela \u2014 unfortunately, I have to use your country as the example of what socialism can do, how it can tear the fabric of a country apart.\u00a0 Because I know a lot about Venezuela.\nI\u2019ve had many, many friends of mine come from Venezuela.\u00a0 They live \u2014 many in Miami \u2014 a certain section of Miami, I won\u2019t mention the name because they\u2019ll say I\u2019m thinking about my business, and I\u2019m not.\u00a0 But they are fantastic people and they like your President.\u00a0 They voted overwhelmingly for me.\u00a0 They like what I\u2019m doing for Venezuela.\nWe have Venezuela very much in our hearts and very much in our sights.\u00a0 And we\u2019re watching it very carefully.\u00a0 And you know what I would say?\u00a0 We\u2019re giving millions and millions of dollars in aid \u2014 not that we want to, from the Maduro standpoint, but we have to because, on a humanitarian \u2014 people are dying.\u00a0 They have no food.\u00a0 They have no water.\u00a0 They have no nothing.\u00a0 They\u2019re dying.\u00a0 No medicine.\u00a0 Their hospitals are closed or \u2014 or don\u2019t even have electricity.\u00a0 It\u2019s so sad to see.\nLet me just say that we have it under control.\u00a0 We are watching it very carefully.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to be very, very \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Russia (inaudible) \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 We\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re watching it very carefully, including other countries that may or may not be playing games.\u00a0 We\u2019re watching it very closely.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But, you know, if Russia is talking with the USA or Guaid\u00f3, what can you tell \u2014 about us?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Just put this in the back of your mind: It\u2019s all going to be fine.\u00a0 We know everything that you said, and it\u2019s all going to be fine.\u00a0 We\u2019re very much involved.\u00a0 We very much know what\u2019s going on, and we\u2019re very much involved.\u00a0 Okay?\nThank you all very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nEND\n5:10 P.M.

EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 It\u2019s a great honor to be with the President of El Salvador.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a tremendous success because, two weeks ago, we signed a cooperation agreement, which is a big thing \u2014 great for El Salvador, great for the United States.\u00a0 And we worked very, very well with our people.\u00a0 And I have great respect for you, and I really appreciate what you\u2019re doing.\nThe President has done an incredible job with MS-13.\u00a0 He realizes what a threat they are.\u00a0 And they have been very, very tough, and we all appreciate that.\u00a0 And thank you very much for the agreement.\nPRESIDENT BUKELE:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Please.\nPRESIDENT BUKELE:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re very happy to be here.\u00a0 It\u2019s an honor to be with the President of the United States and with his team.\u00a0 It\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019re very impressed and \u2014 the whole team being here.\nAnd actually, for us, the United States is not only a partner and an ally, but also a friend.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to show that friendship \u2014 that\u2019s one of the reasons we signed the agreement is because we want to show that friendship to our most important ally, which is the United States.\u00a0 And for us, this is very, very important.\nAnd looking forward, I mean, we have been a little more than 100 days in office, but we look forward to be working with President Trump for the next five years.\u00a0 So I think that will be very good for us.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I thought you were going to say longer than that.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Tell them a little bit longer, they\u2019ll love that.\u00a0 That\u2019ll be breaking news.\nPRESIDENT BUKELE:\u00a0 I\u2019m only going to be \u2014 I\u2019m only going to be for five years.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I know.\u00a0 (Inaudible.) (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT BUKELE:\u00a0 You would need to talk with \u2014 to talk with the next President.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yes.\nPRESIDENT BUKELE:\u00a0 So for \u2014 we\u2019re very happy to be here and we\u2019re hoping that this meeting will only strengthen our relationship even more.\u00a0 And I think it will, because, you know, we\u2019re \u2014 President Trump is very nice and cool, and I\u2019m nice and cool, too.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 So \u2014 we both use Twitter a lot, so, you know, we\u2019ll get along.\u00a0 And we\u2019re very honored.\u00a0 We\u2019re very honored, Mr. President.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, it\u2019s our honor.\u00a0 Thank you very much. \u00a0And we\u2019re working together very well.\u00a0 And the relationship has been excellent.\nMr. Secretary, would you like to say something?\nSECRETARY MCALEENAN:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 And thank you, President Bukele.\u00a0 It\u2019s been a tremendous partnership in the first 100 days you\u2019ve had in office, with all of your team: Minister Hill, Minister Rivas, your security minister.\u00a0 And I really see the advances that you\u2019re making on ending forced migration.\u00a0 It\u2019s very productive for the region, and we\u2019ll be there alongside supporting you.\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 And I think, importantly, we met with Honduras, as you know, and we also had meetings previous to this, but with Guatemala, and had tremendously successful meetings.\u00a0 We also signed agreements with them \u2014 cooperation agreements.\u00a0 Some people use different terms, but we use the word \u201ccooperation agreement,\u201d and at the highest strength, and yours also.\u00a0 And that\u2019s good for all of us.\u00a0 It\u2019s really good for all of us.\nMexico has been fantastic on the border.\u00a0 Today we have 27,000 soldiers.\u00a0 The numbers are way down.\u00a0 What are the numbers you were just telling me?\nSECRETARY MCALEENAN:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 We\u2019re going drop again this month, Mr. President.\u00a0 It will be an over 60 percent reduction from the peak in May.\u00a0 And from Central America, it will be closer to 75 or 80 percent reduction.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 About an 80 percent \u2014 I heard that before.\u00a0 Eighty-one percent.\u00a0 The catch and release is gone, as of almost now.\nSECRETARY MCALEENAN:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 And there won\u2019t be catch and release.\u00a0 We\u2019re not releasing anybody into the country.\u00a0 And especially, we focus on the bad ones, but the bad ones get taken out.\u00a0 We\u2019re removing them from our country.\u00a0 We\u2019re moving them fast.\u00a0 And they are the ones that go first.\u00a0 You might want to discuss that a little bit.\nGo ahead.\nSECRETARY MCALEENAN:\u00a0 Absolutely.\u00a0 So we announced the end of the court-mandated catch and release of families from Central America.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve been able to do that because of our partnerships with the region, like with El Salvador, on streamlining repatriation for those who don\u2019t claim asylum, and working with Mexico through the migrant protection protocol for families if they do claim asylums so that they can get an expedited court hearing.\u00a0 And that\u2019s been a very productive approach.\nWe reduced the overall flow, and we\u2019re taking profits away from criminal smugglers, and we\u2019re making great progress with our international partners under your leadership.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: \u00a0And Mexico, frankly, is doing a great job, with respect to the cartels, by having 27,000 soldiers on our border.\u00a0 They\u2019re decimating a lot of the cartels that were just really coming in.\u00a0 There\u2019s so many people now.\u00a0 There\u2019s so many bodies and really strong, tough, hardened soldiers there that it\u2019s very hard for the cartels to break through.\u00a0 And a lot of bad were \u2014 if you have a cartel, it has not been a good situation for you.\u00a0 So Mexico really is doing themselves a big favor, too.\nBut the President of Mexico has been outstanding in working with all of us, really.\nPRESIDENT BUKELE:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 And we\u2019re very happy.\nThe people that aren\u2019t working with us are the Democrats.\u00a0 The Democrats in Congress are a disaster.\u00a0 We could solve so many more problems with the loopholes, which could be done literally in 15 \u2014 I always say it \u2014 15, 20 minutes \u2014 maybe 30, if we\u2019re a little bit slower.\u00a0 But we could solve the loophole problem in a short period of time.\nDespite that \u2014 and we have asylum also, which we could solve immediately.\u00a0 But we\u2019ve sort of solved asylum by going through different countries.\u00a0 Can you believe it?\u00a0 Where we go to El Salvador, Honduras; we go to Mexico; we go to Guatemala to solve problems of asylum because we can\u2019t go to the United States Congress because the Democrats are playing games.\u00a0 They don\u2019t have any time to do anything else.\u00a0 They don\u2019t have time to do gun safety.\u00a0 They don\u2019t have time to do infrastructure.\u00a0 They have time to do nothing else.\nI\u2019ll tell you what: A lot of people are very angry at what\u2019s going on.\u00a0 They view it as \u2014 you could never use the word \u201cjoke,\u201d because it\u2019s too serious.\u00a0 But they view it as something that should never take place.\u00a0 They\u2019re never going to see anything done with this group in Congress \u2014 the Democrats.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why I really think the Republicans will take over the House.\u00a0 We might even increase in the Senate.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll keep the presidency and we\u2019ll do something that \u2014 like this country has never seen before.\nBut Nancy Pelosi has been taken over by the radical left.\u00a0 I watched it.\u00a0 I just find it hard to believe.\u00a0 But she\u2019s been totally taken over by the radical left.\u00a0 And she does exactly as they want her to do.\u00a0 And a lot of her members now are having second thoughts.\u00a0 They\u2019re saying they\u2019re in a very bad position.\u00a0 They\u2019re in a very bad position.\nWe were just with the President \u2014 the new President of Ukraine \u2014 and it was a fantastic meeting.\u00a0 He said, \u201cNo pressure.\u00a0 No nothing.\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s all a hoax.\u00a0 I call it \u201cthe hoax.\u201d\u00a0 And this is just a continuation of the witch hunt.\u00a0 And that\u2019s all faded; that\u2019s all gone.\u00a0 And they had to come up with something else.\u00a0 The same players \u2014 Adam Schiff, Nadler \u2014 all the same players.\nBut now Nancy Pelosi was forced into a position that she didn\u2019t want to be in, and unfortunately she wasn\u2019t tough enough to stop it.\nSo thank you very much everybody.\u00a0 I think we\u2019re going to be doing a news conference in a little while.\u00a0 And that\u2019ll be the end.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\nEND\n3:32 P.M.

EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much, everybody.\u00a0 We\u2019re with the President of Ukraine, and he\u2019s made me more famous, and I\u2019ve made him more famous.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 I will say he\u2019s got a great reputation.\u00a0 He\u2019s very, very strongly looking into all sorts of corruption and some of the problems they\u2019ve had over the years.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s one of the primary reasons he got elected.\u00a0 His reputation is absolutely sterling.\u00a0 And it\u2019s an honor to be with you.\nAnd we spoke a couple of times, as you probably remember.\u00a0 And they\u2019d like to hear every single word, and we give them every single word, and then they\u2019ll say, \u201cWell, about today?\u201d\u00a0 I think the press would like to stay in the meeting, but we have lots of witnesses, if you\u2019d like to have it.\nBut the country of \u2014 our country is doing phenomenally well.\u00a0 We are \u2014 we have the best economy we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 We have the best employment numbers that we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 We have now almost 160 million people working, which is more than we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 So we\u2019re doing very well in every respect.\u00a0 And I have a feeling that your country is going to do fantastically well.\u00a0 And whatever we can do.\u00a0 You just take care of yourself.\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr. President.\nThank you very much.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great pleasure to me to be here, and it\u2019s better to be on TV than by phone, I think.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 And, Mr. President, thank you very much.\u00a0 And I\u2019m not the first time to stay in New York \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Right.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 \u2014 but I know that you\u2019ve never been in Ukraine.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 And your predecessor also \u2014 how do you say it in English? \u2014 didn\u2019t find time; I mean that.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Right.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 So, can you give me a word that you will come to our great country?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I\u2019m going to try.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And I know a lot of people \u2014 I will say this: I know a lot of people from Ukraine.\u00a0 They\u2019re great people.\u00a0 And I owned something called the Miss Universe pageants years ago, and I sold it to IMG.\u00a0 And when I ran for President, I thought maybe it wouldn\u2019t be the greatest thing to own the Miss Universe and Miss USA pageants.\u00a0 But it\u2019s a great thing.\u00a0 And we had a winner from Ukraine, and we\u2019ve really had \u2014 we got to know the country very well in a lot of different ways.\u00a0 But it\u2019s a country, I think, with tremendous potential.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 Yes, I know it, because I\u2019m from this country.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 And I want to thank you for the invitation to Washington.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Right.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 You invited me.\u00a0 But I think \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, but I think you forgot to tell me the date.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 But I think in the near future.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 They\u2019ll tell you the date.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 (Laughs.)\u00a0 Yes, they know before us.\u00a0 And I want to thank you \u2014 to thank you, especially, Mr. President, to USA, to your government.\u00a0 Like I said, I know many people, many faces, like the Second Family, after you \u2014 my Ukrainian family, we know each other.\nThank you for your support, especially now when \u2014 you know, when we have two \u2014 really, two wars in Ukraine.\u00a0 The first one is with corruption, you know.\u00a0 But we\u2019ll fight \u2014 no, we\u2019ll be winner in this fight, I\u2019m sure.\u00a0 And the priority \u2014 my priority is to stop the war on Donbass and to get back our territories: Crimea, Donbass, Luhansk.\nThank you for your support in this case.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much, Mr. President.\u00a0 If you remember, you lost Crimea during a different administration, not during the Trump administration.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 So you have chance to help us.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\u00a0 I do.\u00a0 But that was during the Obama administration that you lost Crimea, and I didn\u2019t think it was something that you should have.\u00a0 But that was done a long time ago, and I think it was handled poorly.\u00a0 But it\u2019s just one of those things.\nOne of the elements that we discussed is the United States helps Ukraine, but I think that other countries should help Ukraine much more than they\u2019re doing \u2014 Germany, France, the European Union nations.\u00a0 They really should help you a lot more.\u00a0 And I think maybe, together, we\u2019ll work on that.\u00a0 They have to feel a little bit guilty about it because they don\u2019t do what they should be doing.\nYou\u2019re very important to the European Union.\u00a0 You\u2019re very important \u2014 strategically, very important.\u00a0 And I think they should spend a lot more in helping Ukraine.\u00a0 And they know that also, and they actually tell me that, but they don\u2019t seem to produce.\u00a0 So I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll talk to them, and I\u2019ll certainly be talking to them.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr. President.\u00a0 And, you know, now we need \u2014 I want to tell you that we now (inaudible) the new country.\u00a0 And, I\u2019m sorry, but we don\u2019t need help; we need support. \u00a0Real support.\u00a0 And we thank \u2014 thank everybody, thank all of the European countries; they each help us.\u00a0 But we also want to have more \u2014 more.\u00a0 But I understand, so only together, America and EU \u2014 only together we can stop the war.\u00a0 And, you know, we are ready.\u00a0 We just want to tell that we are \u2014 remember that we are the biggest country in Europe, but we want to be the richest one.\u00a0 It\u2019s true; it\u2019s in my heart.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, you know, you have great people in Ukraine, and you have very talented people \u2014\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 Very smart.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 \u2014 in terms of manufacturing, in terms of some of the things they do.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll be doing \u2014 we\u2019re doing trading already, but we should be doing a lot more trading with Ukraine.\u00a0 But you have very talented people.\u00a0 They make great things.\u00a0 You\u2019re at the top of the line, really.\u00a0 So that\u2019s very important.\nAnd the other thing is I\u2019ve heard you actually have \u2014 over the last fairly short period of time, you\u2019ve really made some progress with Russia.\u00a0 I hear a lot of progress has been made.\u00a0 And just keep it going.\u00a0 It\u2019d be nice to end that whole disaster.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 First of all, I want to tell you, before \u2014 before the relations with Russia \u2014 I will prolong, just one minute \u2014\u00a0I mean, you have to know \u2014 I want world to know that now we have the new team, the new parliament, the new government.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Right.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 So now we (inaudible) about 74 laws, new laws, which help for our new reforms: land reform, big privatization.\u00a0 They did the law about concessions.\u00a0 Did \u2014 we (inaudible) general for security, and we launched the Service Secretary.\nIs it right Service Secretary?\nAIDE:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Anti-corruption court, as well.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 An anti-corruption court.\u00a0 As we came, we did \u2014 we launched the anti-corruption court.\u00a0 It began to work on the 5th of September.\u00a0 It was \u2014 you know, it was \u2014 after five days, we had the new government.\nSo, we are ready.\u00a0 We want to show that we \u2014 we just come.\u00a0 And if somebody, if you \u2014 if you want to help us, so just let\u2019s do businesses cases.\u00a0 We have many investment cases.\u00a0 We\u2019re ready.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 And stop corruption in Ukraine, because that will really make you great.\u00a0 That will make you great personally, and it\u2019ll also be so tremendous for your nation, in terms of what you want to do and where you want to take it.\nThank you very much.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great honor.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 Thank you very much, Mr. President.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 President Zelensky, have you felt any pressure from President Trump to investigate Joe Biden and Hunter Biden?\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 I think you read everything.\u00a0 So I think you read text.\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t want to be involved to democratic, open elections \u2014 elections of USA.\nNo, you heard that we had, I think, good phone call.\u00a0 It was normal.\u00a0 We spoke about many things.\u00a0 And I \u2014 so I think, and you read it, that nobody pushed \u2014 pushed me.\nYes.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 In other words, no pressure.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 President Trump, would \u2014 President Trump, would you like Mr. Zelensky to \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Because you know what?\u00a0 There was no pressure.\u00a0 And you know there was \u2014 and, by the way, you know there was no pressure.\u00a0 All you have to do it see it, what went on on the call.\u00a0 But you know that.\u00a0 But you can ask a question, and I appreciate the answer.\nGo ahead.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, would you like President Zelensky to do more on Joe Biden and investigate (inaudible)?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 I want him to do whatever he can.\u00a0 This was not his fault; he wasn\u2019t there.\u00a0 He\u2019s just been here recently.\u00a0 But whatever he can do in terms of corruption, because the corruption is massive.\nNow, when Biden\u2019s son walks away with millions of dollars from Ukraine, and he knows nothing, and they\u2019re paying him millions of dollars, that\u2019s corruption.\nWhen Biden\u2019s son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund \u2014 and the biggest funds in the world can\u2019t get money out of China \u2014 and he\u2019s there for one quick meeting, and he flies in on Air Force Two,\u00a0I think that\u2019s a horrible thing.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s a horrible thing.\nBut I\u2019m going far beyond that.\u00a0 I know the President, and I\u2019ve read a lot about Ukraine.\u00a0 I\u2019ve read a lot about a lot of countries.\u00a0 He wants to stop corruption.\nHe was elected \u2014 I think, number one \u2014 on the basis of stopping corruption, which unfortunately has plagued Ukraine.\u00a0 And if he could do that, he\u2019s doing, really, the whole world a big favor.\u00a0 I know \u2014 and I think he\u2019s going to be successful.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, on Rudy Giuliani, why do you think it\u2019s appropriate for your personal attorney to get involved in government business?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, you\u2019d have to ask Rudy.\u00a0 I will tell you \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You mentioned it to the President here.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I will tell you this, that Rudy is looking to also find out where the phony witch hunt started, how it started.\u00a0 You had a Russian witch hunt that turned out to be two and half years of phony nonsense.\nAnd Rudy Giuliani is a great lawyer.\u00a0 He was a great mayor.\u00a0 He\u2019s highly respected.\u00a0 I\u2019ve watched the passion that he\u2019s had on television over the last few days.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s incredible the way he\u2019s done.\nWhat he\u2019s at is he wants to find out where did this Russian witch hunt that you people really helped perpetrate \u2014 where did it start.\u00a0 How come it started?\u00a0 It was all nonsense.\u00a0 It was a hoax.\u00a0 It was a total hoax.\u00a0 It was a media hoax and a Democrat hoax.\u00a0 Where did it start?\nAnd Rudy has got every right to go and find out where that started.\u00a0 And other people are looking at that, too.\u00a0 Where did it start?\u00a0 The enablers \u2014 where did it all come from?\u00a0 It was out of thin air.\u00a0 And I think he\u2019s got a very strong right to do it.\u00a0 He\u2019s a good lawyer; he knows exactly what he\u2019s doing.\u00a0 And it\u2019s very important.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, do you believe that the emails from Hillary Clinton \u2014 do you believe that they\u2019re in Ukraine?\u00a0 Do you think this whole thing originated \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I think they could be.\u00a0 You mean the 30,000 that she deleted?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yeah, I think they could very well \u2014 boy, that was a nice question.\u00a0 I like that question.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Because, frankly, I think that one of the great crimes committed is Hillary Clinton deleting 33,000 emails after Congress sends her a subpoena.\u00a0 Think of that.\u00a0 You can\u2019t even do that in a civil case; you can\u2019t get rid of evidence like that.\u00a0 She deleted 33,000 emails after \u2014 not before \u2014 after receiving the subpoena from the U.S. Congress.\nI mean, I have never heard \u2014 now, she\u2019s done far worse than that.\u00a0 Although, I don\u2019t know how much worse it can be.\u00a0 But there were many other things she did that were wrong.\u00a0 But that\u2019s so obvious.\u00a0 She gets a subpoena from the United States Congress and she deletes them.\u00a0 And then she said, as I remember it, that, \u201cOh, well, they had to do with the wedding and yoga.\u201d\u00a0 She does a lot of yoga, right?\u00a0 So they had 33,000 emails about the wedding of her daughter and yoga.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think so.\nHow she got away with that one is just \u2014 but it\u2019s one of many.\u00a0 And it\u2019s corrupt government.\u00a0 Because we have corruption also, Mr. President.\u00a0 We have a lot of corruption in our government.\u00a0 And when you see what happened with Hillary Clinton, when you see what happened with Comey, and McCabe, and all of these people \u2014 we have a lot of things going on here too.\u00a0 Hopefully, it\u2019s going to be found out very soon.\u00a0 But I think that a lot of progress has been made.\u00a0 A lot of progress has been made.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Will the military aid continue?\u00a0 Can you assure that it will continue in the future?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re working with Ukraine.\u00a0 And we want other countries to work with Ukraine.\u00a0 When I saw \u201cwork,\u201d I\u2019m referring to money.\u00a0 They should put up more money.\u00a0 We put up a lot of money.\u00a0 I gave you anti-tank busters that \u2014 frankly, President Obama was sending you pillows and sheets.\u00a0 And I gave you anti-tank busters.\u00a0 And a lot of people didn\u2019t want to do that, but I did it.\nAnd I really hope that Russia \u2014 because I really believe that President Putin would like to do something.\u00a0 I really hope that you and President Putin get together and can solve your problem.\u00a0 That would be a tremendous achievement.\u00a0 And I know you\u2019re trying to do that.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 President Zelensky, in the phone call, you said that you would look into Joe Biden \u2014 you would ask your prosecutor to look into the matter.\u00a0 Have you had that conversation \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I think \u2014 no, I haven\u2019t.\u00a0 But I think that \u2014 I think this \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m asking President Zelensky.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I think that somebody, if you look at what he did, it\u2019s so bad \u2014 where his son he goes to China, he walks away with a billion and a half dollars.\u00a0 He goes to Ukraine and he walks away with $50,000 a month and a lot of money in addition to that.\u00a0 And the whole thing with the prosecutor in Ukraine.\nAnd he\u2019s on tape.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t like \u201cmaybe he did it, maybe he didn\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0 He\u2019s on tape doing this.\u00a0 I saw this a while ago.\u00a0 I looked at it and I said, \u201cThat\u2019s incredible.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never seen anything like that.\u201d\u00a0 Now, either he\u2019s dumb, or he thought he was in a room full of really good friends, or maybe it\u2019s a combination of both, in his case.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 President Zelensky \u2014\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 I heard your question.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Don\u2019t cry.\nI mean that we have independent country and independent general security.\u00a0 I can\u2019t push anyone, you know?\u00a0 That\u2019s it.\u00a0 That is the question \u2014 that is the answer.\u00a0\u00a0 So I didn\u2019t call somebody or the new general security.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t ask him.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t push him.\u00a0 That\u2019s it.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you feel obligated to fulfill your promises to President Trump?\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 Just \u2014 sorry.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Speaks Ukrainian.)\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 (Speaks Ukrainian.)\n(As interpreted.)\u00a0 Obligated to do what?\u00a0 (Speaks Ukrainian.)\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Speaks Ukrainian.)\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 (Speaks Ukrainian.)\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Speaks Ukrainian.)\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 (Speaks Ukrainian.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 You want to just \u2014\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry.\n(As interpreted.)\u00a0 Concerning the investigation, actually, I want to underscore that Ukraine is an independent country.\u00a0 We have a new prosecutor general in Ukraine \u2014 a highly professional man with a Western education and history to investigate any case he considers and deems appropriate.\nWhile we have many more issues to care about and to tackle, we have (inaudible), we have Maidan, we have corruption cases, as President Trump rightly mentioned about that.\u00a0 So we know what to do, and we know where to go and what to tackle.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 President Trump, is it appropriate to ask the Attorney General to be involved in this matter?\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 Go ahead.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did you ask House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to find a way out of impeachment yesterday?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Not at all.\u00a0 No.\u00a0 Look, she\u2019s lost her way.\u00a0 She\u2019s been taken over by the radical left.\u00a0 She may be a radical left herself, but she really has lost her way.\u00a0 I spoke to her about guns yesterday.\u00a0 She didn\u2019t even know what I was talking about.\u00a0 She\u2019s not interested in guns.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did it even come up or no?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I\u2019ll tell you what: Nancy Pelosi is not interested in guns and gun protection and gun safety.\u00a0 All she is thinking about is this.\u00a0 She\u2019s been taken over by the radical left, the whole Democrat Party.\u00a0 And you take a look at what\u2019s happening in the media today.\u00a0 The whole party is taken over by the left.\nAnd thank you very much.\u00a0 My poll numbers have gone up.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t want it to go up for this reason.\u00a0 When they look, and when you see what\u2019s happening, people are really angry at Democrats.\u00a0 They\u2019re really angry at the Democrat Party.\nAnd things like, as an example, drug pricing \u2014 getting drugs down \u2014 things like gun safety, infrastructure, the Democrats can\u2019t talk about that because they\u2019ve been taken over by a radical group of people.\u00a0 And Nancy Pelosi, as far as I\u2019m concerned, unfortunately she\u2019s no longer the Speaker of the House.\nThank you very much, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nEND\n2:36 P.M.

EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much.\u00a0 We have some of our great farmers and ranchers and businesspeople in the room, and likewise Japan.\u00a0 And we have tremendous representatives \u2014 some of the biggest people anywhere in the world \u2014 what we\u2019re going and the agreement that we just signed.\u00a0 And it\u2019s an honor to have you with us.\u00a0 I thought you could join us for this meeting.\nWe\u2019ll be talking about certain elements of business and trade, and it would be good to have you with us because you\u2019ll give us some very good ideas.\nWe\u2019re working on phase two already with Japan.\u00a0 I just want to thank Prime Minister Abe and all of your representatives for working so nicely.\u00a0 It\u2019s a tremendous thing that just took place.\u00a0 And they won\u2019t report it today; it gets lost with other fake news.\u00a0 But it\u2019s still big.\u00a0 When you get back to your areas, you\u2019re going to report it.\u00a0 That\u2019s going to be the front-page news.\u00a0 That really is the real news.\nSo it\u2019s a tremendous trade deal.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very big trade deal.\u00a0 I want to thank Bob Lighthizer.\u00a0 I want to thank your counterpart.\u00a0 Congratulations.\u00a0 Great job.\u00a0 And took a lot of work to get it done for this particular week.\u00a0 This was a very important week to all of us.\nBut most importantly \u2014 and if you folks have anything to say \u2014 you\u2019re the biggest human beings I\u2019ve ever seen with the cowboys hats.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 If you have anything to say, I would love to have your ideas.\nBefore I do that, I\u2019d like to just introduce Prime Minister Abe, who\u2019s been my friend, who has worked so well with us in so many ways.\u00a0 They\u2019re spending a tremendous amount of money in our country also, building automobile factories, automobile plants.\nMany of the great Japanese companies, at my request, are now building their plants in the United States, in Detroit, and very, very many other places.\u00a0 We\u2019re all over Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, North Carolina.\u00a0 We have many plants going up right now \u2014 not all from Japan, by the way, but many, many plants.\u00a0 Big ones going up in South Carolina, Florida.\u00a0 It\u2019s been really amazing what\u2019s happened.\u00a0 For years, we didn\u2019t have an auto plant being built, and now we have many of them being built.\u00a0 So, it\u2019s been terrific.\nMr. Prime Minister, perhaps you\u2019d like to say a few things, but I want to \u2014 I really appreciate everything you\u2019ve done.\u00a0 It\u2019s really nice.\nPRIME MINISTER ABE:\u00a0 (As interpreted.)\u00a0 Once again, I would like to share with you all my enthusiasm about the fact that, together, with President Trump, I could sign the Japan-U.S. statement, marking the final agreement of the Japan-U.S. trade negotiations that we have had so far.\nAs a matter of fact, in terms of the GDP, the United States is the world\u2019s largest, number one economy, and Japan is the third-largest economy.\u00a0 And by having this first- and third-largest economies coming to the table and announcing this new agreement means that we will be able to have the very wonderful, positive impact on the global economy as a whole.\u00a0 So I do think that the newly agreed agreement will be something that we have to be proud of as a wonderful achievement.\nSo, since our last meeting on the margins of G20 Osaka Summit, back in June, within the period of the last three months, we have additional eight investment projects in the United States.\u00a0 And I\u2019m very happy to update you about the new status of the Japanese investment.\u00a0 And also, over the last 12 months, we have a total of 31 investment projects in the United States.\nAnd I do think that the achievements that we just announced will bring benefit, of course, to your people \u2014 American stakeholders, as well as American farmers and others.\u00a0 But also, this will bring benefit to Japanese farmers, Japanese investor representatives, workers, as well as consumers.\u00a0 So I do think that this agreement will bring benefits to both sides.\nSo, in this plenary session, I look forward to having a discussion with Mr. President on the current situation surrounding the Middle East and how we can work together to mitigate the tension.\u00a0 And also, I would like to cover other international challenges.\u00a0 And, of course, we would love to discuss the issue of North Korea.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Very good.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do that.\nYou folks, I know you\u2019re very happy, but do you have any suggestions for the future as far as your industry and your whole way of life go?\u00a0 Because you\u2019ve \u2014 we\u2019ve taken in a lot of purchases.\u00a0 A lot of money is coming your way.\u00a0 What other suggestions would you have?\u00a0 Would you have anything, while we\u2019re all together?\nYes.\nMR. SMITH:\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yes.\nMR. SMITH:\u00a0 \u2014 as the President-elect of the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association \u2014 otherwise, the big guy in a cowboy hat \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 That\u2019s right.\nMR. SMITH:\u00a0 \u2014 thank you so much for bringing this agreement to the table and bringing us what you said: a fair and reciprocal trade agreement.\u00a0 What do we want?\u00a0 That is all that we ever want.\u00a0 We asked for a level playing field, and you delivered that to us, and we thank you for that.\u00a0 And it\u2019s a great day too for, we think, for the Japanese people.\u00a0 This will enable them to buy more American beef, more American agricultural products.\u00a0 It offsets \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 And much better beef.\u00a0 Much better beef.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Not even a contest.\nMR. SMITH:\u00a0 And we are \u2014 and American agriculture, here\u2019s one industry that can help offset that trade deficit.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yeah.\nMR. SMITH:\u00a0 And so this gives us that opportunity, it gives them that opportunity.\u00a0 They have been our largest export partner to date, even with higher tariffs and an uneven playing field.\u00a0 Today, you bring us that playing field we asked for.\nIn our world, in agriculture, making a commitment to somebody and living up to it is (inaudible).\u00a0 And you brought us that despite what sometimes the press wants to say about it.\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Well, I\u2019m glad you said that about the press.\u00a0 It\u2019s true.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nYou know, China is starting very big purchases also.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if you know that.\nMR. SMITH:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Very much so.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 But you see that China is back in the market.\u00a0 They\u2019re starting big purchases of ag.\u00a0 Our farmers are very happy.\u00a0 Our ranchers are very happy.\u00a0 But that\u2019s starting \u2014 including beef and including pork.\nMR. SMITH:\u00a0 Absolutely.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 In particular, pork \u2014 they\u2019re buying vast amounts.\u00a0 So, China has started that, and they wanted to let me know, and they have let me know a number of times.\u00a0 But more importantly, I heard from our farmers and ranchers that they\u2019re seeing tremendous orders coming in from China.\u00a0 So that\u2019s very good.\nAnybody else have a question?\nMR. DUVALL:\u00a0 Mr. President, Zippy Duvall, American Farm Bureau.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Sure.\nMR. DUVALL:\u00a0 We just want to say thank you so much.\u00a0 We want to thank the Japanese people and the delegations for leveling this playing field.\u00a0 And what we need in the future is more agreements like this all around the world.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Yeah.\nMR. DUVALL:\u00a0 And what we need is trade, and that\u2019s what makes a rural America grow.\u00a0 But I want to also say to you that the farmers and ranchers of this country appreciate you standing up for us and standing up for the American people, and to continue to show your support for rural America.\u00a0 We appreciate it, and we look forward to continue work with you on that.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, thank you.\u00a0 And you are doing a fantastic job representing the folks.\u00a0 And I will say this: The American farmer and rancher has been targeted by China, and they never once came to me and they said, \u201cSir, please make a deal.\u00a0 Just make any deal; get us back.\u201d\u00a0 They never did.\u00a0 But I went to you, and I said, \u201cHow much money have you lost over the last two years?\u201d\u00a0 And it was $12 million through Sonny, as you know.\u00a0 Sonny said \u2014 Secretary of Agriculture \u2014 he said, \u201cSir, last year was 12 years \u2014 $12 billion.\u00a0 And this year, it\u2019s $16 billion.\u201d\u00a0 And they\u2019re paying us many, many, many billions of dollars in tariffs.\u00a0 And they\u2019re eating it because they\u2019ve devalued their currency.\u00a0 They\u2019re pouring money in.\u00a0 They\u2019ve really been eating the tariffs.\nAnd we\u2019ve took it \u2014 we\u2019ve taken it out of those tariffs and we gave the farmers $12 billion for two years ago.\u00a0 And for last year, we gave $16 billion, divided up among the farmers.\u00a0 So, they\u2019re even.\u00a0 I mean, I wanted to know, what was the number.\u00a0 That was the number.\u00a0 And we had, you know, tens of billions of dollars left over.\u00a0 Because it will be well over $100 billion pretty soon that we will have taken into our Treasury.\nSo out of the big numbers, we took back \u2014 we paid to the farmer.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other President ever in history that would\u2019ve even thought of that.\u00a0 And the reason I did it is because you\u2019ve been so loyal.\u00a0 Nobody says, \u201cOh, you\u2019ve got to make a quick deal.\u201d\u00a0 This doesn\u2019t go quick, to win it.\u00a0 Now, China has got a lot of difficultly.\u00a0 They lost 3 million jobs.\u00a0 Their supply chains are broken up.\u00a0 And they want to make a deal, and we want to make a deal, and I think there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll make a deal.\nBut the American farmer and rancher, like you, are great patriots.\u00a0 You never came to me.\u00a0 Others come, \u201cOh, please, could you make a crummy deal?\u00a0 Just make any deal.\u00a0 We don\u2019t care.\u201d\u00a0 Farmers said, \u201cTake your time.\u00a0 We\u2019re suffering.\u201d\u00a0 But I took the suffering away, in all fairness.\u00a0 But if I didn\u2019t do that, you\u2019d still be with me because you\u2019re great patriots.\u00a0 So I want you to tell them that.\nBut we\u2019re getting closer and closer.\u00a0 But in the meantime, with Japan, it\u2019s been a great day.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR. MARSHALL:\u00a0 Mr. President, Roger Marshall from Kansas, representing one of the largest agriculture-producing states in the country.\u00a0 This deal is huge for Kansas agriculture producers.\nMr. Prime Minister, thank you for your business.\u00a0 We look forward to more opportunities to work with you.\nThe next thing that we need to work on is the USMCA agreement.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Right.\nMR. MARSHALL:\u00a0 You asked us, \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d That\u2019s what\u2019s on top of our mind right now.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I don\u2019t know if Nancy Pelosi is going to have any time to sign it.\u00a0 That\u2019s the only problem.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nWe have USMCA.\u00a0 That\u2019s a great point, Roger.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t think Nancy Pelosi will have time.\u00a0 She\u2019s wasting her time on a \u2014 you know, let\u2019s use a word that they used to use a lot: a \u201cmanufactured crisis.\u201d\u00a0 Remember when they came up with the word nobody ever heard of?\u00a0 And then every media group in the country used the same word that same day.\u00a0 Nobody ever heard of the word, in relation to what they were talking about.\u00a0 They said it was a \u201cmanufactured crisis.\u201d\u00a0 Okay?\nWell, they came up with a manufactured crisis, Roger.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know whether or not they\u2019re going to have time to do any deals.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think they can do any deals.\nYou know, we were working on guns \u2014 gun safety.\u00a0 They don\u2019t even talk \u2014 all they\u2019re talking about is nonsense.\nAnd we released something today that was fantastic.\u00a0 And, you know, you look at that \u2014 it was \u2014 it\u2019s all fake stuff that the media makes up with the Democrats, which are their partners.\u00a0 The Democrats and the media are one in the same.\u00a0 They\u2019re partners.\u00a0 So I want to thank you.\nBut I just don\u2019t know.\u00a0 You know, [US]MCA \u2014 you could tell me, Bob Lighthizer: Are they going to get to take a vote?\u00a0 All they have to do is \u2014 the agreement is signed.\u00a0 It\u2019s approved by Canada.\u00a0 It\u2019s approved by Mexico.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great trade deal \u2014 the greatest we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 NAFTA was a horrible trade deal.\u00a0 It replaces NAFTA.\u00a0 We terminate NAFTA, and this takes over.\nIt\u2019s phenomenal for farmers, it\u2019s good for manufacturers, it\u2019s good for everybody.\u00a0 Even the unions want it because they\u2019ve always hated NAFTA.\u00a0 The unions want it.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know that they\u2019re ever going to get to a vote because they\u2019re all fighting.\u00a0 The Democrats are all fighting with themselves.\u00a0 So, we\u2019ll see.\u00a0 If it happens, it happens.\u00a0 Otherwise, when we take over the House next year, we\u2019ll do it our way.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll get it.\u00a0 We\u2019ll make it even better.\nBob Lighthizer, do you have a comment on that \u2014 USMCA?\nAMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER:\u00a0 Well, I think that it will come up for a vote.\u00a0 When it comes up for a vote, I\u2019m confident that it will pass.\u00a0 It\u2019s 1.4 trillion dollars\u2019 worth of trade and literally millions of American jobs.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 One of the biggest trade deals ever made.\u00a0 It\u2019s a fantastic deal for our country.\u00a0 And, you know, it\u2019s possible they won\u2019t vote.\u00a0 I mean, I know these people much better than you do.\nGo ahead.\u00a0 Yeah.\nPARTICIPANT:\u00a0 The U.S. wheat \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 How tall is the man next to you?\u00a0 How tall are you?\nMR. PADGET:\u00a0 Six-eight, sir.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 And you weigh \u2014 I won\u2019t ask you the weight, but you\u2019re in good shape.\nMR. PADGET:\u00a0 Three hundred.\nTHE PRESIDENT:\u00a0 You look like an ex-football superstar.\u00a0 Keep it up.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 You eat a lot of beef, I assume.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMR. PADGET:\u00a0 Yes, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 You know, you should use him in an ad.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nAll right, go ahead.\nPARTICIPANT:\u00a0 U.S. wheat has dealt with China for \u2014 I mean with, I\u2019m sorry, Japan for 70 years now.\u00a0 So 50 percent of the wheat that goes to Japan comes from the United States.\u00a0 So this is a tremendous trade deal for the U.S. wheat.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 That\u2019s great.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 This is a great deal.\u00a0 This is a great day.\u00a0 They won\u2019t report it.\u00a0 You won\u2019t see any articles, but we \u2014 at least we know.\u00a0 But locally, you\u2019re going to get great \u2014 you know, because locally, the press \u2014 you know, people don\u2019t understand this, but locally, the press treats us very well.\u00a0 Nationwide, just ridiculous.\u00a0 They\u2019re fake.\u00a0 But we have gotten \u2014 so when you go back to your local states, you\u2019re going to get tremendous press on this because this is what they\u2019ve wanted.\u00a0 They\u2019ve wanted this really for a long time.\nAnd I think Kansas is doing pretty well.\u00a0 Do you like this, man?\nPARTICIPANT:\u00a0 Yes, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Here\u2019s another man from Kansas, right?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 How\u2019s he doing?\u00a0 Do they love him in Kansas?\nMR. MARSHALL:\u00a0 Next to you, sir, he is the popular person in Kansas.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 He knows what to say.\u00a0 Hey, I like him.\u00a0 I like him.\u00a0 Anyway, anybody else have anything to say?\u00a0 Please.\nMR. HARRINGTON:\u00a0 Mr. President, I\u2019m Dave Harrington.\u00a0 I\u2019m President of the National Pork Producers Council.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never spent many days in New York, but this is the greatest day I\u2019ve ever spent in New York.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Wow.\nMR. HARRINGTON:\u00a0 Thank you and thank Prime Minister Abe for this agreement.\u00a0 And it gives so much opportunity to our 60,000 pork producers across this great country.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 That\u2019s great.\nMR. HARRINGTON:\u00a0 And I can\u2019t thank you for getting up and working hard every day.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 And how are you doing with China?\u00a0 Because they\u2019re coming in big.\u00a0 Tell me: How is pork doing with China?\nMR. HARRINGTON:\u00a0 It\u2019s just starting to turn around.\u00a0 We\u2019re starting \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Are you seeing \u2014 are you seeing the big movement now?\nMR. HARRINGTON:\u00a0 It\u2019s starting to move right now.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 They\u2019re going to need a lot.\nMR. HARRINGTON:\u00a0 They\u2019re going to need a lot.\u00a0 They\u2019ve got some issues over there with African swine fever.\u00a0 And we\u2019re standing ready to help them out.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 So they are starting to come in and you can see that happening very big.\u00a0 How will that compare to Japan, in terms of \u2014 ultimately, where do you see China versus Japan in terms of buys?\nMR. HARRINGTON:\u00a0 Well, Japan has always been our largest value market, one of our greatest customers.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to say, Mr. President.\u00a0 But I think that, because of the disease they have over there today, they\u2019re going to need \u2014 they\u2019re short in supply of pork.\u00a0 So I think there\u2019s great opportunity.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 No, China is going to buy more pork than they\u2019ve ever bought by far.\u00a0 I mean, they told me the numbers are going to be incredible.\u00a0 And they\u2019re coming to you.\nMR. HARRINGTON:\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to help them out.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 So, look, they want to make a deal.\u00a0 They\u2019re trying to be nice.\u00a0 I was nice to them.\u00a0 You know, they had their \u2014 as you know, their 70th anniversary.\u00a0 And it was very important to them.\u00a0 Did you know?\u00a0 Their 70th.\u00a0 And it was October 1st; that\u2019s when the tariffs get lifted. \u00a0And they called and they said, \u201cCould you possibly make it another day?\u201d\u00a0 And we delayed it two weeks.\u00a0 So we did them a favor.\u00a0 But they\u2019re doing us a favor.\u00a0 But they\u2019re buying a lot of agricultural product and, in particular, where you are.\u00a0 Okay?\nMR. HARRINGTON:\u00a0 Yes, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 That was a very nice statement.\u00a0 Anybody else?\u00a0 You guys all right?\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Please.\nMR. SUYDAM:\u00a0 My name is Ryck Suydam.\u00a0 I\u2019m a 12th-generation farmer from Somerset County, New Jersey.\u00a0 A lot of these folks here represent big ag.\u00a0 I\u2019m a small ag.\u00a0 I\u2019m a small farm \u2014 been there for 300 years.\u00a0 But all of this helps raise agricul- \u2014 it\u2019s going to help me \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Right.\nMR. SUYDAM:\u00a0 \u2014 and a lot of small farmers all across this country.\u00a0 So we had to get the first one done.\u00a0 Thank you to Japan.\u00a0 And next, we need the USMCA, and then China.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Right.\nMR. SUYDAM:\u00a0 So big ag \u2014 good.\u00a0 Small ag \u2014 good, too.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 And we signed Korea, remember.\u00a0 You know, we did a big deal with South Korea.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great trade deal.\u00a0 It\u2019s already done.\u00a0 And it\u2019s in action.\u00a0 And it\u2019s had a very, very positive impact.\u00a0 It\u2019s been very positive for us.\u00a0 And that was a great deal that we got done relatively quickly.\u00a0 But nobody talks about that one, you know?\u00a0 By normal standards, a big deal.\nBut Japan is going to be special.\u00a0 And this is my special friend.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you all very much.\u00a0 Thank you for being here.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nThank you very much, everybody.\nEND\n1:02 P.M.

EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Are you ready?\u00a0 Ready?\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\nI\u2019m honored to be here today among so many terrific leaders dedicated to the future of democracy, prosperity, and freedom for the people of Venezuela.\u00a0 We are behind you.\nFor this deeply important event, we are grateful to be joined by Secretary Mike Pompeo, Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Secretary Wilbur Ross, and Administrator Mark Green.\u00a0 Thank you all for being here.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nI want to extend my profound appreciation to every representative with us from across the Western Hemisphere.\u00a0 Each of you is part of a historic coalition of 55 countries that recognize the legitimate constitutional government of Venezuela.\u00a0 We are especially grateful to be joined by representatives of the people of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, and Peru, for their leadership and assistance in the face of an unprecedented political, economic, and humanitarian disaster, which has been going on for a long time.\u00a0 And we\u2019re helping a lot.\u00a0 We\u2019re helping a lot.\nLet me also recognize two leaders from the government of Venezuela\u2019s legitimate interim government, Presidential Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, Julio Borges.\u00a0 Where\u2019s Julio?\u00a0 Julio?\u00a0 Please, stand up, Julio.\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 And Venezuela\u2019s Ambassador to the United States, Carlos Vecchio.\u00a0 Where\u2019s Carlos?\u00a0 Thank you, Carlos.\u00a0 Please.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 It\u2019s very nice.\u00a0 Thank you.\nAs everyone in this room knows, the situation in Venezuela is a tragedy of historic proportions.\u00a0 The Maduro regime does not care about the welfare of their own people.\u00a0 They care about their own power.\u00a0 It\u2019s what they want, is power and money.\u00a0 They want the money, too \u2014 not just power.\nSocialism has destroyed what was once among the most prosperous countries anywhere in the world.\u00a0 You go back 20 years ago and you look: one of the wealthiest countries in the world, relatively speaking.\u00a0 And now, they don\u2019t have water, they don\u2019t have food, they don\u2019t have medicine, they don\u2019t have anything.\nToday, Venezuelans are starving and they\u2019re dying from lack of medicine, doctors, help.\u00a0 According to U.N. Human Rights Commissioner, Maduro\u2019s Cuban-trained death squads have murdered up to 10,000 Venezuelans, and they think that number is extremely low.\u00a0 Citizens since \u2014 all since 2018.\u00a0 That\u2019s over a very short period of time.\u00a0 These atrocities are an outrage to all and everything that we hold dear.\nAs President of the United States, I am committed to the future of stability, prosperity, and liberty for Venezuela.\u00a0 We will stand with the Venezuelan people every single day until they are finally freed from this horrible and brutal oppression.\u00a0 They will be freed.\u00a0 It will happen.\nOur first objective is to ensure a peaceful and constitutional transition, paving the way for free and fair elections.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we, at the United States, and in the United States, are doing everything we can to isolate Maduro and his cronies.\nOver the past year, the U.S. Treasury Department has imposed very tough sanctions to prevent Maduro and his enablers from accessing the U.S. financial system.\u00a0 Last month, I issued an executive order to completely freeze the assets of the Maduro regime in the United States.\u00a0 Our sanctions have been tightly focused on closing down every avenue by which Maduro sustains his criminal and totalitarian rule.\u00a0 And he has been vicious, he\u2019s been corrupt.\u00a0 He\u2019s been as bad as you get.\nAt the same time, we have undertaken significant efforts to ensure that the Venezuelan people have access to food, medicine, and other humanitarian supplies, despite the regime\u2019s efforts to stop aid from coming into Venezuela.\u00a0 They are making it very, very hard to get aid into Venezuela.\u00a0 We are getting aid into Venezuela, but it\u2019s a very difficult thing.\u00a0 You would think, frankly, that would be to their benefit to let aid get in instead of letting people die from lack of medicine or food.\u00a0 But they don\u2019t make it easy, but we get it in anyway.\nWe call on Maduro to immediately allow his lifesaving humanitarian aid.\u00a0 This has to be allowed to come into Venezuela for the long-suffering Venezuelan people.\u00a0 Unfortunately, a few countries outside of this hemisphere continue to enable this depraved regime with military and technological support.\u00a0 The most significant factor propping up the Venezuelan regime is the communist dictatorship in Cuba.\u00a0 Maduro allows Cuba to plunder Venezuelans\u2019 oil, raid its wealth, and rob its people.\u00a0 Venezuela\u2019s oil is at a low point.\u00a0 Not much is being taken out.\u00a0 Not many people are in there because of the dangers involved. But nevertheless, there\u2019s some money coming out, and it goes into Cuba.\nHe\u2019s allowed thousands of Cuban agents to infiltrate Venezuela\u2019s security forces and other institutions.\u00a0 In other words, Maduro has sold out his nation to a foreign dictatorship, and it has been that way a long time.\nThe civilized world must pressure the Cuban regime to leave Venezuela immediately.\u00a0 The United States is ready to support a democratic transition government, and we know that our partners around the world \u2014 of which we have many \u2014 are ready as well.\u00a0 Venezuela\u2019s rebuilding can begin the moment a peaceful transition occurs.\nThis is a critical moment for the world.\u00a0 We must not allow the destructive forces of socialism and communism to repeat the horrors of the last century.\u00a0 Can\u2019t allow it to happen.\u00a0 There have been horrors like nobody would believe.\u00a0 We can\u2019t allow this to happen today in Venezuela.\u00a0 We resolve that the future of the Western Hemisphere will not be written by socialists and tyrants, but by liberty-loving patriots.\u00a0 Our great destiny is to become the first fully free hemisphere in human history.\u00a0 We have a very, very good chance of doing that.\nWe work and we pray for the hour when every person across the region, and every suffering soul in Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, will finally know the blessings of democracy and the full glory of freedom.\nOnce again, thank you all to so many of my friends in this room and to the nations that have helped us with respect to Venezuela and many other things.\nI want to personally thank the President of Mexico for the incredible work and spirit and everything that they\u2019ve done on our southern border.\u00a0 Our southern border has become secure, with 27,000 Mexican soldiers on the Mexican side, telling people, \u201cSorry, you can\u2019t come in.\u201d\u00a0 So I want to thank the President of Mexico.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nAnd for Venezuela: It will all work.\u00a0 It will all come back.\u00a0 And good things will happen.\nThank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 (Applause.)\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, on the transcript, sir?\u00a0 On the transcript, sir?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 You know what?\u00a0 Because you\u2019re so anxious, we\u2019re going to let you stay as certain presidents speak.\u00a0 Because I know that\u2019s what you want to hear.\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\u00a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 Let me do the introductions.\u00a0 First of all, Mr. President, let me say how proud I am to be part of everything that you have led in this effort to try and bring the Venezuelan crisis to a peaceful and democratic resolution.\u00a0 Your leadership has been outstanding.\nThe work of the Lima Group, too, has been important.\u00a0 I believe it\u2019s a sign of a new era in Latin America.\u00a0 And like your nations, the United States is tired of the heartbreaking stories of Venezuelans forced to dig through trash cans for food, of the hospital patients dying unnecessarily, of the millions of innocent children who go to bed hungry every night because 94 percent of Venezuelan households can\u2019t get their basic necessities.\nThe United States wants to announce today an additional tranche of $118 million to aid the Venezuelan crisis response.\u00a0 The assistance will include $36 million for relief efforts inside of Venezuela.\u00a0 They\u2019ll provide urgently needed medicines that improve access to quality healthcare of for the Venezuelan people.\u00a0 The remaining monies will protect and assist many of your countries, as you generously host a combined 4.4 million Venezuelans who have fled their country \u2014 over 10 percent of the Venezuelan population.\u00a0 We\u2019ll help provide food, shelter, clean water, and legal support for them.\nThis brings to over $570 million the amount of aid that we have provided \u2014 the United States has provided \u2014 to ease the crisis, both inside Venezuela and throughout the hemisphere.\nAs long as the Maduro regime stands, it will stand between the Venezuelan people and their return to freedom and prosperity.\u00a0 The United States, under President Trump, remains a steadfast supporter of the Venezuelan people and of the Lima Group in its ongoing struggle for the prosperous, free, and democratic Venezuela.\nIt\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce a member of the true government of Venezuela: Julio Borges.\u00a0 Mr. Borges is a longtime supporter of a return to democracy in Venezuela, and for this, he has been forced into exile by the Maduro regime.\u00a0 He now lives in Colombia.\nEarlier this year, Interim President Juan Guaid\u00f3 appointed him as Venezuela\u2019s representative to the Lima Group, and later as presidential advisor on external relationships.\nJulio, you\u2019ve been instrumental in rallying the international community to place pressure on the Maduro regime, and we\u2019re honored to have you with us today.\u00a0 The floor is yours, sir.\nMR. BORGES:\u00a0 Well, thank you.\u00a0 Thank you for being here today.\u00a0 I would like to make a five-minute introduction about what\u2019s going on in Venezuela.\nI could be speaking in Spanish, but I have chosen to speak in English because, Mr. President, on behalf of the Venezuelan people, their democratic-elected National Assembly, and their President Juan Guaid\u00f3, I want to personally thank for the leadership that you have shown in our case.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Thank you.\nMR. BORGES:\u00a0 Your leadership has made a big difference.\u00a0 And I thank each and every one of you for what your governments have done to end the suffering in Venezuela and reclaim our democracy.\u00a0 You have helped us in our time of great need, which is something no Venezuelan will ever forget.\nVenezuela is not alone.\u00a0 Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his criminal regime is responsible for the historic crisis impacting our country.\u00a0 To put it in perspective, from an economic standpoint of view: Venezuela\u2019s economic crisis is almost three times bigger than the Great Depression.\u00a0 And from the humanitarian point of view, it\u2019s become the second-largest refugee exodus in the world.\nPresident Guaid\u00f3 has been working closely with you to reverse the situation.\u00a0 We, as a Venezuelan, has been fighting for almost 20 years.\u00a0 We have gone down many paths, seeking a peaceful solution, but the dictatorship has stalled all possibilities time and time again.\nToday, Venezuela is not passively asking for solidarity.\u00a0 The suffering of our people gives testimony of our times of need.\u00a0 This sacrifice have achieved important accomplishments.\nLet\u2019s be clear: The diplomatic pressure from democratic voices has been effective.\u00a0 The dictatorship is fractured and weak, and only backed by the Cuban regime that has tortured, persecuted our people and our brave armed force.\nMichelle Bachelet\u2019s recent report exposed the repression, torture, and executions that the regime carries out against civilians and members of our armed force in Venezuela.\u00a0 Mr. President and all leaders of Americas, over the last year, regime force have murdered a citizen every two hours.\nHavana is the mastermind behind this tragedy to sustain Maduro.\u00a0 This is why crucial to break the regime of D\u00edaz-Canel, Ra\u00fal Castro, and Maduro with more democratic pressure.\nOur humble petition to the Americas is simple: First, that every country in the region should impose sanctions on Cuba.\u00a0 It is time for Castro and D\u00edaz-Canel to understand the consequences of supporting a criminal regime.\nSecond, every country in the region should move forward, as agreed to in TIAR, to prosecute any regime member involved in drug trafficking, human rights violations, and corruption.\nThird, maintain the support for Venezuelan National Assembly and our President, Juan Guaid\u00f3.\nAnd last but not least, compel Europe to more actively join efforts to put more pressures on Maduro regime.\nThe alliance between the Cuban and Venezuelan regimes holds over 50 million hostage.\u00a0 Millions of Cubans and Venezuelans have had to abandon their homelands to escape oppression.\u00a0 And this should not be tolerated.\nI have had the honor of traveling to the border of C\u00facuta with President Duque, with President Pi\u00f1era, with President Abdo, and as well with Secretary Pompeo.\u00a0 And most recently, with Ivanka Trump.\u00a0 I have seen them moved to tears because the stories of suffering cannot be put into words.\u00a0 Mark has been many times over there as well.\nAs rightly so, because we are not talking about cold numbers or (inaudible) statistics.\u00a0 Socialist dictatorships, such as Maduro, dehumanize.\u00a0 With great pain, we have seen the regime has done the most vulnerable people in my country.\u00a0 Child prostitution, President, has been normalized.\u00a0 Women are being sold into slavery and taken to other countries for profit, while children and (inaudible) have been recruited by terrorist organizations linked to drug trafficking.\u00a0 And our people are crawling through the streets of Venezuela looking for food.\nThe Maduro regime is a corrupt, criminal enterprise that has turned what once was one of the most prosperous country in the region into a living and dying hell.\u00a0 The world needs to understand that Venezuela is not a dictatorship, not even a failed state.\u00a0 It\u2019s something worse.\u00a0 The Maduro regime is a sanctuary for the promotion of terrorism, drug trafficking, and organized crime.\nFaced with this reality, there are those who are shocked when we say that no option can be ruled out to rid Venezuela and the region for this corrupt regime.\u00a0 They say that keeping every option is very dangerous.\u00a0 However, Mr. President, evidence shows that the worst thing that could happen in Venezuela is that nothing happens.\nWhat is truly dangerous, what is unacceptable, is having a regime destabilize the whole region while 35 million people are starving to death.\u00a0 Ignoring the crisis in Venezuela leaves an open wound that will infect the region and will destroy democracy throughout the continent.\u00a0 As I said, in the case of Venezuela, the worst thing that could happen is that nothing happens.\nPresidents and leaders of the Americas, on behalf of millions of Venezuela, I thank you because we are close to victory.\nPresident Trump, you have led the free world in the fight for freedom in Venezuela and Cuba.\u00a0 History and the Venezuelan people will remember and recognize you.\u00a0 Recent opinion research in Venezuela shows the total support for our policy, for your plans to Venezuela, and you have become the most important leader within Venezuela, which is very important for us.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Maybe I\u2019ll move there.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nMR. BORGES:\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Next time.\nI\u2019m convinced that working together, working together the whole Americas, 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, another wall will fall in the Americas and give the way to a chapter of peace, progress, and development for our hemisphere.\nVenezuela will rise with the strength of its people.\u00a0 We will reveal our country with the spirit of those who refuse to surrender.\nPresident and leaders of the Americas, 32 millions of Venezuelans and 12 millions of Cubans are at the gates of freedom.\u00a0 Let\u2019s not make them wait any longer.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\nWould the presidents like to speak in front of the media or without the media?\u00a0 We have three presidents who are going to speak.\u00a0 Would you prefer the media or not, presidents?\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\u00a0 President Duque, would you like to begin?\nPRESIDENT DUQUE:\u00a0 Thank you so much, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 Thank you so much, President Trump, for gathering this very important meeting.\u00a0 I\u2019m going to be brief, but I\u2019m going to try to be very (inaudible) in my statements.\nWhat we have been seeing in Venezuela is a tragedy of major proportional dimensions.\u00a0 What we have seen is the worst humanitarian crisis in Latin America\u2019s recent history.\u00a0 What we have seen is the brutality of a dictatorship that is only comparable to what some countries saw when Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 brutalized thousands of people.\nThat\u2019s why we consider him a criminal.\u00a0 That\u2019s why we have denounced him before the International Criminal Court with the support of many heads of state around the hemisphere, and also in Europe.\u00a0 We consider his behavior to be not only regrettable, but it has to punished, and that\u2019s why we all must continue to embrace the diplomatic blockade and to explore as many sanctions are needed against that criminal.\nThe second thing I want to highlight is that the migration crisis \u2014 it\u2019s really producing a major social impact.\u00a0 In Colombia, we have supported the migrants.\u00a0 We have 1.4 million Venezuelan brothers and sisters, and we will continue to provide support because we know they\u2019re coming to our country with (inaudible), lacking of medicine, and many of them without any access to food.\nBut we have to make the call to the whole world that this situation is unsustainable.\u00a0 And that\u2019s why the coalition that is sitting among this table, but also the coalition that has build of more than 54 states that have recognized President Guaid\u00f3 and they have recognized the National Assembly, must also continue to bring more countries to the table, because this coalition has to be stronger day by day.\nI also want to highlight that the behavior of the dictatorship is also affecting the national security of many states, obviously including Colombia.\u00a0 Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has become a sponsor, and he\u2019s providing safe haven to terrorist groups from Colombia to plot against the Colombian people.\u00a0 And that attitude is only comparable to what the world saw when the Taliban regime allowed al Qaeda to plot against the whole world, in their soil.\nWe continue believing that that behavior is in direct violation of Resolution 1373 that was issued by the United Nations Security Council right after September 11.\u00a0 And we\u2019re going to make that denouncement public today when I deliver my speech before the U.N. General Assembly.\u00a0 I will present a report that is going to be given to the U.N. Security Council, the U.N. Secretary-General.\u00a0 And I believe that that report should be open for a debate.\nWe also believe that that behavior requires not only the whole world to be seen and to be addressed, but we also want to highlight what happened this week in a historical way.\u00a0 The Inter-American Treaty for Reciprocal Assistance had a historical voting, and they recognized that the Maduro regime is pretty much involved in terrorism sponsorship, narco-trafficking activities.\nAnd last but not least, I also want to mention that the following months are crucial.\u00a0 The following weeks, the following hours are crucial.\u00a0 Some people speculate whether Maduro is going to last more.\u00a0 But I continue the debate should be different.\u00a0 The debate is: What is it that we\u2019re going to do so that we can grant liberty to the Venezuelan people?\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re gathered here at this table, and that\u2019s why we support the approach of strengthening everything we can do so that three conditions are met:\u00a0the end of the dictatorship, a transitionary government, the call for free elections, and maybe I\u2019ll include a plan for economic and social recovery in Venezuela.\nThank you so much, Mr. President.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\u00a0 Thank you, President Duque.\u00a0 Now I would like to hear from President Pi\u00f1era.\u00a0 Please.\nPRESIDENT PI\u00d1ERA:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Well, we all know that we are dealing with a criminal, corrupt \u2014 (microphone is turned on.)\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry.\nThank you very much.\u00a0 We all know that we are dealing with a criminal, corrupt, and drug-related regime.\u00a0 And the conclusion is very clear: This dictatorship has to stop.\nMaduro is part of the problem and will never be part of the solution.\u00a0 The solution has been expressed by President Duque.\u00a0 We need to end this regime, have a transitional government, call to free and open and transparent elections, and then the big story of how to reconstruct Venezuela will start.\u00a0 And we will be supporting all of these stages.\nBut at the same time, we have to realize there are some allies that are helping Venezuela, and we are talking \u2014 we are talking about countries like Cuba, China, Russia, Iran, and Turkey.\u00a0 I think that the whole Latin American community, and maybe the whole world, should let them very clear that what they are doing is affecting \u2014 and it\u2019s really affecting the interests of all Latin American countries.\nWe know that we have already more than 4.5 million refugees \u2014 migrants.\u00a0 But probably the number will double if the situation stays as it is.\u00a0 In the case of Chile, we have received more than 450,000, which is about 2 percent of our population.\u00a0 Compared to the U.S., it would be equivalent to 6 million Venezuelans in the U.S.\nAnd we are happy to do so because that\u2019s one way to help.\u00a0 But the solution and the final conclusion here should be we have to make it impossible for the regime to continue.\nOne thing is that we have to seize all their assets of their main members of this dictators; avoid and prevent any moment so that the situation will become more and more difficult for them; and, at the same time, we have to help and solidarize and continue with the democratic opposition in Venezuela.\nBut I know the situation is very, very difficult.\u00a0 But you know that the night never is so dark that just before dawn.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nSECRETARY POMPEO:\u00a0 Thank you, President Pi\u00f1era.\u00a0 President Moreno, the floor is yours, sir.\nPRESIDENT MORENO:\u00a0 (As interpreted.)\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 My dear colleagues, the ill that brings us here today has to do with the democracy of the world and the stability of a region.\u00a0 It is related specifically to this people \u2014 this people who was suffering and the presidents around the table from countries to which over 4 million migrants have gone; people who are living beings, who wander the streets, they wander our avenues, looking for refuge.\u00a0 They seek a way out.\u00a0 They seek a solution to the problems they face when it comes to hunger, safety, and health.\u00a0 They have been kicked out by this regime.\u00a0 They seek social justice.\nHowever, this regime has been despotic for so many years, and it is due to this.\u00a0 But international action should never be interpreted as intervention.\u00a0 We cannot talk about intervention because all countries, including Venezuela, have signed all commitments, all agreements related to the democracy of this community.\nThis is an ethical obligation as well.\u00a0 My colleagues who preceded me have stated this.\u00a0 We are talking about over 4 million people, who are humble people, who have fled, who flee this despotic regime, this criminal regime \u2014 the regime of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, which is the most corrupt, which harbors terrorists, and where all international criminals go in the end to seek refuge, including those who represented corrupt regimes in our countries.\nThis is why it is \u2014 this meeting is so important.\u00a0 This meeting is important because I would like to energetically make the call for democracy to be put into place in Venezuela, as it should be in a country that has lived in democracy for so long.\u00a0 They cannot be going through a genocidal regime.\u00a0 The only\u00a0exit is democracy \u2014 democracy with a broad international observation, with no pressure, with no red spots, so that people are able to vote freely.\nThis cannot happen under any circumstances unless they\u2019re \u2014 unless all democratic institutions, all international organizations involved in democracy participate, are involved in making sure that the will of Venezuelans is no longer deceived.\nVenezuela is most definitely a failed state.\u00a0 It is a failed state, and this is shown by the exit not of dissidents, not people opposed to policies.\u00a0 We\u2019re talking about humble people \u2014 people who are personally living through how terrible it has been to suffer through the regime of a despot.\nUnfortunately, we have to hear that this is a Bolivarian republic.\u00a0 No, we are a Bolivarian republic.\u00a0 We are aligned with the ideals of Washington, of Jefferson, and we converge with the ideals of Bol\u00edvar.\u00a0 And Bol\u00edvar never would have imagined any like this.\u00a0 Bol\u00edvar must be turning in his grave.\nLooking at everything that has happened to a democracy that at one time was among the most prosperous in Latin America \u2014 and I will say this again \u2014 that is why this meeting is such a great one, and it will be great as long we can talk about benefitting that democracy.\u00a0 Maduro must leave power and, immediately, there must be a call for elections.\u00a0 That is the only way out.\u00a0 That is the only way out for this people.\u00a0 As I said, there must be elections with broad international observation.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, in the Ukraine transcript, sir, you talk about how good the U.S. has been to Ukraine.\u00a0 You ask President Zelensky for a favor. \u00a0And you ask him to talk to the Attorney General of the United States and Rudy Giuliani about Joe Biden.\u00a0 Sir, how is that not pressuring President Zelensky?\u00a0 How does the transcript \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 There was no pressure whatsoever.\u00a0 And if you take a look at the Democrats, they went down to see the President of Ukraine, and they asked him for all sorts of things.\u00a0 And, \u201cDon\u2019t go with the Republicans,\u201d\u00a0and, \u201cStay with us.\u201d\u00a0 And \u2014 like it\u2019s a political war.\u00a0 They shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u00a0 That should be an impeachable event, I guess, based on what you\u2019re saying.\nThe Democrats just came out.\u00a0 They went down there \u2014 a group of people \u2014 some of whom I was dealing with on the gun issue.\u00a0 And they went down and put tremendous pressure on Ukraine.\u00a0 The President himself just came out with a statement saying there was absolutely no pressure put on him.\u00a0 And there wasn\u2019t.\nWhat I do want to see is, is I want to see other countries helping Ukraine also, not just us.\u00a0 As usual, the United States helps, and nobody else is there.\u00a0 So I want to see other countries help.\nJust so you understand, it\u2019s the single greatest witch hunt in American history \u2014 probably, in history, but in American history.\u00a0 It\u2019s a disgraceful thing.\u00a0 The letter was a great letter.\u00a0 Meaning, the letter revealing the call.\u00a0 That was done at the insistence of myself and other people that read it.\u00a0 It was a friendly letter.\u00a0 There was no pressure.\u00a0 The way you had that built up \u2014 that call \u2014 it was going to be the call from hell.\u00a0 It turned out to be a nothing call, other than a lot of people said, \u201cI never knew you could be so nice.\u201d\nSo, part of the problem you have is you have the fake news.\u00a0 You have a lot of corrupt reporting.\u00a0 You have some very fine reporters and journalists, but you have a lot of corrupt reporters, a lot of corrupt journalists.\u00a0 I would rate you right in there, by the way.\nAnd \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You said \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Excuse me.\u00a0 Excuse me.\n(Cross-talk.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Excuse me.\u00a0 Excuse me.\nSo, we\u2019re having \u2014 if you noticed, the stock market went up.\u00a0 When they saw the nonsense, all of a sudden the stock market went down very substantially yesterday when they saw a charge.\u00a0 After they read the charge, the stock market went up very substantially.\nWe have created the greatest economy in the history of our country.\u00a0 The greatest economy in the world.\u00a0 Had my opponent won, China would right now be the number one economy, by far.\u00a0 And right now, China is way behind us and they\u2019ll never catch us if we have smart leadership.\u00a0 Way behind.\nWe\u2019ve picked up trillions of dollars, and they\u2019ve lost trillions of dollars.\u00a0 And they want to make a deal very badly.\u00a0 And it could happen.\u00a0 It could happen.\u00a0 It could happen.\u00a0 It could happen sooner than you think.\nOur military is rebuilt.\u00a0 Our military has never been stronger.\u00a0 When I came in, it was depleted.\u00a0 Our vets are happy.\u00a0 So many great things are happening.\u00a0 And the Democrats feel they\u2019re going to lose.\u00a0 We had the highest poll number \u2014 Rasmussen \u2014 53, but they say you could add 10 to it.\u00a0 A lot of people say you could add more than 10 to it because a lot of people just don\u2019t want to talk about it, but they want to vote for Trump.\nSo I just say this: We have the strongest country we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 We have the best economy we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 We have the best unemployment numbers we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 We have the best employment numbers we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 We have now almost 160 million people working.\u00a0 That\u2019s far more than we\u2019ve ever had working in our country before.\nThank you very much, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\nEND\n10:52 A.M.

EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Thank you very much everybody for being here.\u00a0 I\u2019m honored to be alongside my great friend, Prime Minister Abe of Japan, to formally announce our first stage of a phenomenal new trade agreement with our close ally.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been a great friend, and the Prime Minister has been my great friend.\nI want to thank Ambassador Lighthizer for his extraordinary work in these negotiations.\u00a0 He works 24 hours a day.\u00a0 He never sleeps.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 He\u2019s a great gentleman.\u00a0 When I first got this job, everybody was saying, \u201cYou got to get Lighthizer.\u00a0 You have to get Lighthizer.\u201d\u00a0 He\u2019s a great and fine man who also gets along with the other side, and in particular with Japan.\u00a0 They\u2019ve developed a really great mutual respect.\nI\u2019m grateful as well to several members of my Cabinet for joining us this afternoon \u2014 and that\u2019s Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary Ross, Secretary Pompeo.\u00a0 And my thanks also to Representative Roger Marshall.\nIn a moment, the Prime Minister and I will sign a document outlining the significant steps we\u2019re taking toward a fair and reciprocal trade agreement.\u00a0 We insist on fairness and we insist on reciprocal \u2014 we want reciprocal agreements from now on because \u2014 and I\u2019m not just talking about Japan.\u00a0 I\u2019m talking about virtually every nation in the world.\u00a0 They have not been reciprocal.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been one-way streets.\nUnder the market access agreement that we\u2019re announcing today, Japan will open new markets to approximately $7 billion in American agricultural products.\u00a0 Japanese tariffs will now be significantly lower, or eliminated entirely, for U.S. beef, pork, wheat, cheese, corn, wine, and so much more.\nThis is a huge victory for America\u2019s farmers, ranchers, and growers.\u00a0 And that\u2019s very important to me.\nAnd it\u2019s very important that you report this news, as opposed to not reporting it, because it\u2019s great for our farmers, as you know, and ranchers, and for a lot of other people.\nWe also reached a deal for robust commitments on $40 billion of digital trade between our two countries.\u00a0 This will greatly expand commerce across cutting-edge products and services.\nJapan is one of America\u2019s most important economic partners.\u00a0 We are Japan\u2019s top foreign investor, by far.\u00a0 And Japanese investments in America supports hundreds of thousands of American jobs.\nThe deal we\u2019re announcing today will reduce our chronic trade deficit built up and taken effect over many, many years of dealing with other governments and other administrations, and it\u2019ll deepen our enduring national ties.\u00a0 It\u2019s a very important deal.\nOur teams will continue negotiations on remaining areas of interest to achieve a final comprehensive agreement.\u00a0 We\u2019re negotiating very, very big transactions with Japan.\u00a0 Some of them \u2014 I think probably all of them in the not-too-distant future will happen.\u00a0 This is a big chunk.\nBut in the fairly near future, we\u2019re going to be having a lot more very comprehensive deals signed with Japan.\nSo this is tremendous for our technology industries, but in particular, these are really big dollars for our farmers and for our ranchers.\nI want to congratulate Prime Minister Abe.\u00a0 Not so long ago, he had a tremendous election victory.\u00a0 He won by a lot, and a lot of people say that it was only his friendship with President Trump that got him that tremendous victory.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nSo, Shinzo, I want to thank you again for your steadfast partnership.\u00a0 I look forward to continuing to work closely with you as we pursue lasting prosperity and peace for our people.\u00a0 And congratulations to the people of Japan and congratulations on your great victory.\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER ABE:\u00a0 (As interpreted.)\u00a0 Thank you, Donald.\u00a0 For the past 12 months, since we have signed the Japan-U.S. joint statement back in September 2018, we have had strenuous negotiations between Japan and the United States.\u00a0 And I am very delighted that today, together with you, we are announcing final agreement on our trade agreement.\nOne of the highlights of this new agreement is that under this agreement, we together, we\u2019ll be able to bring benefit to everyone in Japan as well in the United States, namely consumers, producers, as well as workers.\u00a0 So the outcome of this negotiation is actually a win-win solution for Japan and the United States.\nSo under the new agreement, I do believe that we have successfully covered a wide range of areas, including not only the industrial goods, but also the agricultural products and also the digital trade between the two sides.\u00a0 And I am convinced that now, with these two agreements in place, we will be able to develop both economies of Japan and the United States as we move forward.\nSo, in your first statement, you applauded the great work done by Ambassador Lighthizer and also the wonderful American team.\u00a0 And from my own perspective, I do share your great applaud for the American team because they have been very, very tough throughout the negotiation process.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And to live up to your expectation, and also to meet the (inaudible) between Japan and the United States, I specifically assigned this important work to now the Foreign Minister, Foreign Minister Motegi, and his team.\u00a0 And I am sure that he did a great job, too.\nAnd I do believe that the outcome of this negotiation is namely the crystallization of the strenuous and persistent efforts made by Minister Motegi and his team.\u00a0 And also, I like to underscore that both Minister Motegi and Ambassador Lighthizer did take care and also took into account the national interest of Japan and the United States, respectively.\nAnd now, here we are today to share this final agreement.\u00a0 And I\u2019m so glad that Donald also shared my aspiration, and you join us and join me in making this final judgement \u2014 decision to announce the final agreement on the two agreements between Japan and the United States.\nSince your inauguration, Japan is the number one investor in the United States.\u00a0 In total of 25.7 billion U.S. dollar investment was already announced by Japan, which have already created more than 50,000 jobs for American people.\nAnd I am convinced that when we are to have the entry into force of the Japan-U.S. trade agreement, as well as Japan-U.S. digital trade agreement, we will further galvanize the investment in the two sides, and also we\u2019ll be able to deepen our economic relations.\u00a0 So once again, this will be a win-win outcome for Japan and the United States.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\n(The agreement is signed.)\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEND\n12:18 P.M.

EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, distinguished delegates, ambassadors, and world leaders:\nSeven decades of history have passed through this hall, in all of their richness and drama.\u00a0 Where I stand, the world has heard from presidents and premiers at the height of the Cold War.\u00a0 We have seen the foundation of nations.\u00a0 We have seen the ringleaders of revolution.\u00a0 We have beheld saints who inspired us with hope, rebels who stirred us with passion, and heroes who emboldened us with courage \u2014 all here to share plans, proposals, visions, and ideas on the world\u2019s biggest stage.\nLike those who met us before, our time is one of great contests, high stakes, and clear choices.\u00a0 The essential divide that runs all around the world and throughout history is once again thrown into stark relief.\u00a0 It is the divide between those whose thirst for control deludes them into thinking they are destined to rule over others and those people and nations who want only to rule themselves.\nI have the immense privilege of addressing you today as the elected leader of a nation that prizes liberty, independence, and self-government above all.\u00a0 The United States, after having spent over two and a half trillion dollars since my election to completely rebuild our great military, is also, by far, the world\u2019s most powerful nation.\u00a0 Hopefully, it will never have to use this power.\nAmericans know that in a world where others seek conquest and domination, our nation must be strong in wealth, in might, and in spirit.\u00a0 That is why the United States vigorously defends the traditions and customs that have made us who we are.\nLike my beloved country, each nation represented in this hall has a cherished history, culture, and heritage that is worth defending and celebrating, and which gives us our singular potential and strength.\nThe free world must embrace its national foundations.\u00a0 It must not attempt to erase them or replace them.\nLooking around and all over this large, magnificent planet, the truth is plain to see: If you want freedom, take pride in your country.\u00a0 If you want democracy, hold on to your sovereignty.\u00a0 And if you want peace, love your nation.\u00a0 Wise leaders always put the good of their own people and their own country first.\nThe future does not belong to globalists.\u00a0 The future belongs to patriots.\u00a0 The future belongs to sovereign and independent nations who protect their citizens, respect their neighbors, and honor the differences that make each country special and unique.\nIt is why we in the United States have embarked on an exciting program of national renewal.\u00a0 In everything we do, we are focused on empowering the dreams and aspirations of our citizens.\nThanks to our pro-growth economic policies, our domestic unemployment rate reached its lowest level in over half a century.\u00a0 Fueled by massive tax cuts and regulations cuts, jobs are being produced at a historic rate.\u00a0 Six million Americans have been added to the employment rolls in under three years.\nLast month, African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment reached their lowest rates ever recorded. We are marshaling our nation\u2019s vast energy abundance, and the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.\u00a0 Wages are rising, incomes are soaring, and 2.5 million Americans have been lifted out of poverty in less than three years.\nAs we rebuild the unrivaled might of the American military, we are also revitalizing our alliances by making it very clear that all of our partners are expected to pay their fair share of the tremendous defense burden, which the United States has borne in the past.\nAt the center of our vision for national renewal is an ambitious campaign to reform international trade.\u00a0 For decades, the international trading system has been easily exploited by nations acting in very bad faith.\u00a0 As jobs were outsourced, a small handful grew wealthy at the expense of the middle class.\nIn America, the result was 4.2 million lost manufacturing jobs and $15 trillion in trade deficits over the last quarter century.\u00a0 The United States is now taking that decisive action to end this grave economic injustice.\u00a0 Our goal is simple: We want balanced trade that is both fair and reciprocal.\nWe have worked closely with our partners in Mexico and Canada to replace NAFTA with the brand new and hopefully bipartisan U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\nTomorrow, I will join Prime Minister Abe of Japan to continue our progress in finalizing a terrific new trade deal.\nAs the United Kingdom makes preparations to exit the European Union, I have made clear that we stand ready to complete an exceptional new trade agreement with the UK that will bring tremendous benefits to both of our countries.\u00a0 We are working closely with Prime Minister Boris Johnson on a magnificent new trade deal.\nThe most important difference in America\u2019s new approach on trade concerns our relationship with China.\u00a0 In 2001, China was admitted to the World Trade Organization.\u00a0 Our leaders then argued that this decision would compel China to liberalize its economy and strengthen protections to provide things that were unacceptable to us, and for private property and for the rule of law.\u00a0 Two decades later, this theory has been tested and proven completely wrong.\nNot only has China declined to adopt promised reforms, it has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping, forced technology transfers, and the theft of intellectual property and also trade secrets on a grand scale.\nAs just one example, I recently met the CEO of a terrific American company, Micron Technology, at the White House.\u00a0 Micron produces memory chips used in countless electronics.\u00a0 To advance the Chinese government\u2019s five-year economic plan, a company owned by the Chinese state\u00a0allegedly\u00a0stole Micron\u2019s designs, valued at up to $8.7 billion.\u00a0 Soon, the Chinese company obtains\u00a0patents for nearly an identical product, and Micron was banned from selling its own goods\u00a0in China.\u00a0 But we are seeking justice.\nThe United States lost 60,000 factories after China entered the WTO.\u00a0 This is happening to other countries all over the globe.\nThe World Trade Organization needs drastic change.\u00a0 The second-largest economy in the world should not be permitted to declare itself a \u201cdeveloping country\u201d in order to game the system at others\u2019 expense.\nFor years, these abuses were tolerated, ignored, or even encouraged.\u00a0 Globalism exerted a religious pull over past leaders, causing them to ignore their own national interests.\nBut as far as America is concerned, those days are over.\u00a0 To confront these unfair practices, I placed massive tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese-made goods.\u00a0 Already, as a result of these tariffs, supply chains are relocating back to America and to other nations, and billions of dollars are being paid to our Treasury.\nThe American people are absolutely committed to restoring balance to our relationship with China.\u00a0 Hopefully, we can reach an agreement that would be beneficial for both countries.\u00a0 But as I have made very clear, I will not accept a bad deal for the American people.\nAs we endeavor to stabilize our relationship, we\u2019re also carefully monitoring the situation in Hong Kong.\u00a0 The world fully expects that the Chinese government will honor its binding treaty, made with the British and registered with the United Nations, in which China commits to protect Hong Kong\u2019s freedom, legal system, and democratic ways of life.\u00a0 How China chooses to handle the situation will say a great deal about its role in the world in the future.\u00a0 We are all counting on President Xi as a great leader.\nThe United States does not seek conflict with any other nation.\u00a0 We desire peace, cooperation, and mutual gain with all.\u00a0 But I will never fail to defend America\u2019s interests.\nOne of the greatest security threats facing peace-loving nations today is the repressive regime in Iran.\u00a0 The regime\u2019s record of death and destruction is well known to us all.\u00a0 Not only is Iran the world\u2019s number one state sponsor of terrorism, but Iran\u2019s leaders are fueling the tragic wars in both Syria and Yemen.\nAt the same time, the regime is squandering the nation\u2019s wealth and future in a fanatical quest for nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them.\u00a0 We must never allow this to happen.\nTo stop Iran\u2019s path to nuclear weapons and missiles, I withdrew the United States from the terrible Iran nuclear deal, which has very little time remaining, did not allow inspection of important sites, and did not cover ballistic missiles.\nFollowing our withdrawal, we have implemented severe economic sanctions on the country.\u00a0 Hoping to free itself from sanctions, the regime has escalated its violent and unprovoked aggression.\u00a0 In response to Iran\u2019s recent attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, we just imposed the highest level of sanctions on Iran\u2019s central bank and sovereign wealth fund.\nAll nations have a duty to act.\u00a0 No responsible government should subsidize Iran\u2019s bloodlust.\u00a0 As long as Iran\u2019s menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be lifted; they will be tightened.\u00a0 Iran\u2019s leaders will have turned a proud nation into just another cautionary tale of what happens when a ruling class abandons its people and embarks on a crusade for personal power and riches.\nFor 40 years, the world has listened to Iran\u2019s rulers as they lash out at everyone else for the problems they alone have created.\u00a0 They conduct ritual chants of \u201cDeath to America\u201d and traffic in monstrous anti-Semitism.\u00a0 Last year the country\u2019s Supreme Leader stated, \u201cIsrael is a malignant cancerous tumor\u2026that has to be removed and eradicated: it is possible and it will happen.\u201d\u00a0 America will never tolerate such anti-Semitic hate.\nFanatics have long used hatred of Israel to distract from their own failures.\u00a0 Thankfully, there is a growing recognition in the wider Middle East that the countries of the region share common interests in battling extremism and unleashing economic opportunity.\u00a0 That is why it is so important to have full, normalized relations between Israel and its neighbors.\u00a0 Only a relationship built on common interests, mutual respect, and religious tolerance can forge a better future.\nIran\u2019s citizens deserve a government that cares about reducing poverty, ending corruption, and increasing jobs \u2014 not stealing their money to fund a massacre abroad and at home.\nAfter four decades of failure, it is time for Iran\u2019s leaders to step forward and to stop threatening other countries, and focus on building up their own country.\u00a0 It is time for Iran\u2019s leaders to finally put the Iranian people first.\nAmerica is ready to embrace friendship with all who genuinely seek peace and respect.\nMany of America\u2019s closest friends today were once our gravest foes.\u00a0 The United States has never believed in permanent enemies.\u00a0 We want partners, not adversaries.\u00a0 America knows that while anyone can make war, only the most courageous can choose peace.\nFor this same reason, we have pursued bold diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula. I have told Kim Jong Un what I truly believe: that, like Iran, his country is full of tremendous untapped potential, but that to realize that promise, North Korea must denuclearize.\nAround the world, our message is clear: America\u2019s goal is lasting, America\u2019s goal is harmony, and America\u2019s goal is not to go with these endless wars \u2014 wars that never end.\nWith that goal in mind, my administration is also pursuing the hope of a brighter future in Afghanistan.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the Taliban has chosen to continue their savage attacks.\u00a0 And we will continue to work with our coalition of Afghan partners to stamp out terrorism, and we will never stop working to make peace a reality.\nHere in the Western Hemisphere, we are joining with our partners to ensure stability and opportunity all across the region.\u00a0 In that mission, one of our most critical challenges is illegal immigration, which undermines prosperity, rips apart societies, and empowers ruthless criminal cartels.\nMass illegal migration is unfair, unsafe, and unsustainable for everyone involved: the sending countries and the depleted countries.\u00a0 And they become depleted very fast, but their youth is not taken care of and human capital goes to waste.\nThe receiving countries are overburdened with more migrants than they can responsibly accept.\u00a0 And the migrants themselves are exploited, assaulted, and abused by vicious coyotes.\u00a0 Nearly one third of women who make the journey north to our border are sexually assaulted along the way.\u00a0 Yet, here in the United States and around the world, there is a growing cottage industry of radical activists and non-governmental organizations that promote human smuggling.\u00a0 These groups encourage illegal migration and demand erasure of national borders.\nToday, I have a message for those open border activists who cloak themselves in the rhetoric of social justice: Your policies are not just.\u00a0 Your policies are cruel and evil.\u00a0 You are empowering criminal organizations that prey on innocent men, women, and children.\u00a0 You put your own false sense of virtue before the lives, wellbeing, and [of] countless innocent people.\u00a0 When you undermine border security, you are undermining human rights and human dignity.\nMany of the countries here today are coping with the challenges of uncontrolled migration.\u00a0 Each of you has the absolute right to protect your borders, and so, of course, does our country.\u00a0 Today, we must resolve to work together to end human smuggling, end human trafficking, and put these criminal networks out of business for good.\nTo our country, I can tell you sincerely: We are working closely with our friends in the region \u2014 including Mexico, Canada, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Panama \u2014 to uphold the integrity of borders and ensure safety and prosperity for our people.\u00a0 I would like to thank President L\u00f3pez Obrador of Mexico for the great cooperation we are receiving and for right now putting 27,000 troops on our southern border.\u00a0 Mexico is showing us great respect, and I respect them in return.\nThe U.S., we have taken very unprecedented action to stop the flow of illegal immigration.\u00a0 To anyone considering crossings of our border illegally, please hear these words: Do not pay the smugglers.\u00a0 Do not pay the coyotes.\u00a0 Do not put yourself in danger.\u00a0 Do not put your children in danger.\u00a0 Because if you make it here, you will not be allowed in; you will be promptly returned home.\u00a0 You will not be released into our country.\u00a0 As long as I am President of the United States, we will enforce our laws and protect our borders.\nFor all of the countries of the Western Hemisphere, our goal is to help people invest in the bright futures of their own nation.\u00a0 Our region is full of such incredible promise: dreams waiting to be built and national destinies for all.\u00a0 And they are waiting also to be pursued.\nThroughout the hemisphere, there are millions of hardworking, patriotic young people eager to build, innovate, and achieve.\u00a0 But these nations cannot reach their potential if a generation of youth abandon their homes in search of a life elsewhere.\u00a0 We want every nation in our region to flourish and its people to thrive in freedom and peace.\nIn that mission, we are also committed to supporting those people in the Western Hemisphere who live under brutal oppression, such as those in Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.\nAccording to a recent report from the U.N. Human Rights Council, women in Venezuela stand in line for 10 hours a day waiting for food.\u00a0 Over 15,000 people have been detained as political prisoners.\u00a0 Modern-day death squads are carrying out thousands of extrajudicial killings.\nThe dictator Maduro is a Cuban puppet, protected by Cuban bodyguards, hiding from his own people while Cuba plunders Venezuela\u2019s oil wealth to sustain its own corrupt communist rule.\nSince I last spoke in this hall, the United States and our partners have built a historic coalition of 55 countries that recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela.\nTo the Venezuelans trapped in this nightmare: Please know that all of America is united behind you.\u00a0 The United States has vast quantities of humanitarian aid ready and waiting to be delivered.\u00a0 We are watching the Venezuela situation very closely.\u00a0 We await the day when democracy will be restored, when Venezuela will be free, and when liberty will prevail throughout this hemisphere.\nOne of the most serious challenges our countries face is the specter of socialism.\u00a0 It\u2019s the wrecker of nations and destroyer of societies.\nEvents in Venezuela remind us all that socialism and communism are not about justice, they are not about equality, they are not about lifting up the poor, and they are certainly not about the good of the nation.\u00a0 Socialism and communism are about one thing only: power for the ruling class.\nToday, I repeat a message for the world that I have delivered at home: America will never be a socialist country.\nIn the last century, socialism and communism killed 100 million people.\u00a0 Sadly, as we see in Venezuela, the death toll continues in this country.\u00a0 These totalitarian ideologies, combined with modern technology, have the power to excise [exercise] new and disturbing forms of suppression and domination.\nFor this reason, the United States is taking steps to better screen foreign technology and investments and to protect our data and our security.\u00a0 We urge every nation present to do the same.\nFreedom and democracy must be constantly guarded and protected, both abroad and from within.\u00a0 We must always be skeptical of those who want conformity and control.\u00a0 Even in free nations, we see alarming signs and new challenges to liberty.\nA small number of social media platforms are acquiring immense power over what we can see and over what we are allowed to say.\u00a0 A permanent political class is openly disdainful, dismissive, and defiant of the will of the people.\u00a0 A faceless bureaucracy operates in secret and weakens democratic rule.\u00a0 Media and academic institutions push flat-out assaults on our histories, traditions, and values.\nIn the United States, my administration has made clear to social media companies that we will uphold the right of free speech.\u00a0 A free society cannot allow social media giants to silence the voices of the people, and a free people must never, ever be enlisted in the cause of silencing, coercing, canceling, or blacklisting their own neighbors.\nAs we defend American values, we affirm the right of all people to live in dignity.\u00a0 For this reason, my administration is working with other nations to stop criminalizing of homosexuality, and we stand in solidarity with LGBTQ people who live in countries that punish, jail, or execute individuals based upon sexual orientation.\nWe are also championing the role of women in our societies.\u00a0 Nations that empower women are much wealthier, safer, and much more politically stable.\u00a0 It is therefore vital not only to a nation\u2019s prosperity, but also is vital to its national security, to pursue women\u2019s economic development.\nGuided by these principles, my administration launched the Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity Initiatives.\u00a0 The W-GDP is first-ever government-wide approach to women\u2019s economic empowerment, working to ensure that women all over the planet have the legal right to own and inherit property, work in the same industries as men, travel freely, and access credit and institutions.\nYesterday, I was also pleased to host leaders for a discussion about an ironclad American commitment: protecting religious leaders and also protecting religious freedom.\u00a0 This fundamental right is under growing threat around the world.\u00a0 Hard to believe, but 80 percent of the world\u2019s population lives in countries where religious liberty is in significant danger or even completely outlawed.\u00a0 Americans will never fire or tire in our effort to defend and promote freedom of worship and religion.\u00a0 We want and support religious liberty for all.\nAmericans will also never tire of defending innocent life.\u00a0 We are aware that many United Nations projects have attempted to assert a global right to taxpayer-funded abortion on demand, right up until the moment of delivery.\u00a0 Global bureaucrats have absolutely no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that wish to protect innocent life.\u00a0 Like many nations here today, we in America believe that every child \u2014 born and unborn \u2014 is a sacred gift from God.\nThere is no circumstance under which the United States will allow international entries [entities] to trample on the rights of our citizens, including the right to self-defense.\u00a0 That is why, this year, I announced that we will never ratify the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty, which would threaten the liberties of law-abiding American citizens.\u00a0 The United States will always uphold our constitutional right to keep and bear arms.\u00a0 We will always uphold our Second Amendment.\nThe core rights and values America defends today were inscribed in America\u2019s founding documents.\u00a0 Our nation\u2019s Founders understood that there will always be those who believe they are entitled to wield power and control over others. Tyranny advances under many names and many theories, but it always comes down to the desire for domination.\u00a0 It protects not the interests of many, but the privilege of few.\nOur Founders gave us a system designed to restrain this dangerous impulse.\u00a0 They chose to entrust American power to those most invested in the fate of our nation: a proud and fiercely independent people.\nThe true good of a nation can only be pursued by those who love it: by citizens who are rooted in its history, who are nourished by its culture, committed to its values, attached to its people, and who know that its future is theirs to build or theirs to lose.\u00a0 Patriots see a nation and its destiny in ways no one else can.\nLiberty is only preserved, sovereignty is only secured, democracy is only sustained, greatness is only realized, by the will and devotion of patriots.\u00a0 In their spirit is found the strength to resist oppression, the inspiration to forge legacy, the goodwill to seek friendship, and the bravery to reach for peace.\u00a0 Love of our nations makes the world better for all nations.\nSo to all the leaders here today, join us in the most fulfilling mission a person could have, the most profound contribution anyone can make: Lift up your nations.\u00a0 Cherish your culture.\u00a0 Honor your histories.\u00a0 Treasure your citizens. Make your countries strong, and prosperous, and righteous.\u00a0 Honor the dignity of your people, and nothing will be outside of your reach.\nWhen our nations are greater, the future will be brighter, our people will be happier, and our partnerships will be stronger.\nWith God\u2019s help, together we will cast off the enemies of liberty and overcome the oppressors of dignity.\u00a0 We will set new standards of living and reach new heights of human achievement. We will rediscover old truths, unravel old mysteries, and make thrilling new breakthroughs.\u00a0 And we will find more beautiful friendship and more harmony among nations than ever before.\nMy fellow leaders, the path to peace and progress, and freedom and justice, and a better world for all humanity, begins at home.\nThank you.\u00a0 God bless you.\u00a0 God bless the nations of the world.\u00a0 And God bless America.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 (Applause.)\nEND\n10:49 A.M.

Chancellor Merkel \u2014 just left Chancellor Merkel.\u00a0 And she\u2019s very much involved.\u00a0 We have a lot of people involved.\u00a0 A lot of people would like to get us to the table.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see what happens.\u00a0 But, so far, we have not agreed to a meeting.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 President Trump \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Say it?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have you asked Prime Minister Khan to mediate with Iran?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, he\u2019d like to do that, and we have a very good relationship.\u00a0 And there\u2019s a chance that that could happen.\u00a0 But, no, I haven\u2019t spoken.\u00a0 He actually asked me.\u00a0 He thought it would be a good idea to meet.\nAnd we\u2019re here.\u00a0 We\u2019re in New York together.\u00a0 And we have the time to do it, although we\u2019ve done a lot of bilats in the last two days.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had tremendous success.\u00a0 I was treated very nicely on the speech.\u00a0 A lot of good reviews on what we had to say.\u00a0 And so, I appreciate that.\u00a0 The media was actually very good on the speech.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, your reaction to Speaker Pelosi saying today that she is moving toward an impeachment announcement later this afternoon?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I haven\u2019t heard this.\u00a0 Look, it\u2019s just a continuation of the witch hunt.\u00a0 It\u2019s the worst witch hunt in political history.\u00a0 We have the strongest economy we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 We have the best unemployment numbers we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, lowest in history.\u00a0 Best numbers we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 Our country is doing phenomenally well.\nWe have rebuilt our military to the tune of $2.5 trillion.\u00a0 We have the strongest military on Earth.\u00a0 If you look at the vets, if you look at any group, they\u2019re doing fantastically well.\nSo the country is doing the best it\u2019s ever done, and I just heard that she\u2019d like to impeach.\u00a0 We also just had Rasmussen, as you heard, just came out with a poll.\u00a0 We\u2019re at 53, and they say 53 plus maybe 10.\u00a0 A lot of people say that, because you add about 10 percent to the Trump polls because some people don\u2019t want to talk; they just want to go out and do it, and they know what\u2019s good.\nOur country is doing the best it\u2019s ever done.\u00a0 They\u2019re going to lose the election and they figure this is a thing to do.\u00a0 This never happened where we\u2019re in the election, and \u2014 I mean, if she does that, they all say that\u2019s a positive for me, for the election.\u00a0 You could also say, \u201cWho needs it?\u201d\u00a0 It\u2019s bad for the country.\u00a0 Then they wonder why they don\u2019t get gun legislation done.\u00a0 Then they wonder why they don\u2019t get drug prices lowered.\u00a0 Because all they do is talk nonsense.\u00a0 No more infrastructure bills.\u00a0 No more anything.\u00a0 All they do \u2014 that\u2019s all they do.\nYou watch Jerry Nadler and Schiff \u2014 you know, Schiff has been doing this stuff for three and a half years.\u00a0 It\u2019s the craziest thing anybody has ever seen.\nAnd other countries \u2014 like today we\u2019re with Iraq and we were with other countries during the day, and every one of them says how crazy it is.\u00a0 We have the strongest country in the world, the best economy we\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 And she\u2019s talking impeachment.\u00a0 So I think that \u2014 and, by the way, she hasn\u2019t even seen the phone call.\u00a0 The phone call was perfect.\u00a0 The call that wasn\u2019t perfect and the words that weren\u2019t perfect were Joe Biden with respect to his son.\u00a0 And his son takes away millions of dollars out of Ukraine, and millions of dollars out of China, and you don\u2019t talk about that.\u00a0 It\u2019s a real disgrace.\nBut the good news is, the voters get it.\u00a0 This is why they say it\u2019s good for the election.\u00a0 But you know what?\u00a0 It\u2019s bad for the country.\u00a0 What she\u2019s doing is very bad \u2014 if it\u2019s true.\u00a0 I can\u2019t even believe that it\u2019s true.\u00a0 How can you do this and you haven\u2019t even seen the phone call?\nThe whistleblower, they say, was second-hand or third-hand.\u00a0 And it was reported \u2014 I have no idea who the whistleblower is.\u00a0 I guess I could find out.\u00a0 Maybe I couldn\u2019t find out.\u00a0 But they say it was a very partisan person \u2014 the whistleblower.\u00a0 But it was second- or third-hand.\u00a0 Never heard the call.\nBut I have better than that.\u00a0 We have the whole transcript of the call, which will be released tomorrow.\u00a0 And comments will be put with respect.\u00a0 It was a perfect call.\u00a0 There was no quid pro quo, unlike Biden.\u00a0 There was no nothing.\u00a0 It was a perfect call.\u00a0 A very nice call.\u00a0 And, in fact, I thought this was very nice.\u00a0 Ukraine just came out.\u00a0 It made a very good statement.\u00a0 It was a very good call.\u00a0 There was no pressure put on them whatsoever.\nThank you all very much.\u00a0 Appreciate it.\nEND\n3:39 P.M.

great pride.\u00a0 And for this, once again, let me thank President Trump from the bottom of my heart.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER MODI:\u00a0 (As interpreted.)\u00a0 After the formation of the new government, we haven\u2019t even completed four months, but during this period of time I\u2019ve had the occasion to meet President Trump three times now.\u00a0 And we\u2019ve had very detailed and fruitful discussions on many issues.\nIn the world, between the oldest and the largest democracy, this kind of nearness \u2014 this relationship of ease and this continuous engagement \u2014 I think our countries coming together, which believe in democratic values, I think that\u2019s a very good sign for the world.\u00a0 For India and the United States, notably, we are very close friends, but this is a friendship that is based on values, and this will continue to strengthen in the times to come.\nAs far as trade is concerned, I\u2019m very happy that the day before yesterday, in Houston, in my presence there was an agreement signed by the Indian company, Petronet, for an amount of $2.5 billion, which is the amount of investment that the Indian company is going to do in the energy sector.\u00a0 And this will mean that in the years to come, in the decades to come, this will result in trade of an amount of $60 billion and create 50,000 jobs, which I think is a very big initiative taken by India.\nPresident Trump is definitely my friend, but he is also a friend of India.\u00a0 And relations between India and the United States are proceeding at a very good and fast pace.\nOnce again, let me thank President Trump.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Thank you very much.\nPRIME MINISTER MODI:\u00a0 Thank you.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, you\u2019ve mentioned \u2014 President Trump, you\u2019ve mentioned trade.\u00a0 You \u2014 and Prime Minister Modi had, during the Houston event, said that you know the art of the deal.\u00a0 Can we expect something on a trade deal in talks today?\u00a0 Or what, the U.S. and India, they can do together to boost trade ties going forward?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I think very soon.\u00a0 We\u2019re doing very well.\u00a0 And Bob Lighthizer, who\u2019s right here, was negotiating with India and their very capable representatives.\u00a0 And I think very soon we\u2019ll have a trade deal.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have the larger deal down the road a little bit, but we will have a trade deal very soon.\nGo ahead.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You\u2019ve been talking about, you know, clamping down on terrorism from across the globe.\u00a0 Pakistan has been the global epicenter of terrorism.\u00a0 You spoke about it in Houston.\u00a0 How do you make sure that you clamp down on terrorism from Pakistan?\u00a0 Because that is posing a threat to democracies like the U.S. and India.\u00a0 Even the business interests suffer because of continuing terrorism.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I had a very good meeting with Prime Minister Khan.\u00a0 It was a long meeting and we discussed a lot.\u00a0 And I think he\u2019d like to see something happen that would be very fruitful, very peaceful.\u00a0 And I think that will happen, ultimately.\u00a0 I really believe that these two great gentlemen will get together and work something.\nI also \u2014 you know, you mentioned Pakistan, but Iran would have to be at the top of the list.\u00a0 Because if you look at terrorist states, that\u2019s been the number one for a long time.\nBut I really believe that Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Khan, they get along \u2014 they will get along when they get to know each other.\u00a0 And I think a lot of good things will come from that meeting.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan admitted that thirty, forty thousand terrorists are still in Pakistan.\u00a0 And yesterday, at the think-tank event, he again admitted that the Pakistan army and ISI trained al Qaeda.\u00a0 Separately, there are reports that thousands of terrorists are ready to enter through (inaudible) India.\u00a0 In this backdrop, what would you like to give message to Pakistan?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I mean, the message is not for me to give, it\u2019s for Prime Minister Modi to give.\u00a0 And I think he gave that loud and clear on \u2014 the other day when we were together.\u00a0 He gave a pretty loud message.\u00a0 And I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be able to handle that situation.\nYes, sir.\u00a0 Go ahead.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 President Trump, this is a spectacular show you had with Prime Minister Modi in Houston.\u00a0 What are the significance of this event for India-U.S. relations and your personal chemistry with Prime Minister?\u00a0 Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, my personal chemistry is as good as it can get.\u00a0 I have great respect.\u00a0 I have great admiration.\u00a0 And I really like him \u2014 that\u2019s another thing.\u00a0 And he\u2019s a great gentleman and a great leader.\nAnd I remember India before.\u00a0 Now, not intimately, but I remember India before, and it was very torn.\u00a0 There was a lot of dissension, a lot of fighting.\u00a0 And he brought it all together, like a father would bring it together. \u00a0Maybe he\u2019s the father of India.\u00a0 We\u2019ll call him \u201cthe father of India.\u201d\u00a0 I think that\u2019s not so bad.\u00a0 But he brought things together.\u00a0 And you don\u2019t hear that anymore.\u00a0 So I think he\u2019s done a fantastic job.\nBut I think that what the event showed is how much I like the country of India and how much I like your Prime Minister.\nThere was tremendous spirit in that room, too.\u00a0 And they love this gentleman to my right.\u00a0 They really do.\u00a0 Those people went crazy.\u00a0 That was like Elvis.\u00a0 That was like an American \u2014 he\u2019s like an American version of Elvis.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 It was like we brought in the middle of an all-American deal; Elvis Presley came back.\u00a0 No, he was \u2014 that was quite something.\u00a0 They love your Prime Minister.\u00a0 It\u2019s a great thing.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, in Houston, you said that you stand with India in fight against Islamic radical terrorism.\u00a0 How do you see the statement coming from the Pakistani Prime Minister admitting that the Pakistani state, the ISI trained al Qaeda?\u00a0 How do you see \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, I haven\u2019t heard that.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t heard that.\u00a0 And I know this: that your Prime Minister will take care of it.\u00a0 So if there\u2019s a problem, he\u2019ll \u2014 if there\u2019s a problem, he\u2019ll take care of it.\u00a0 It would be great if they could work out something on Kashmir.\u00a0 We all want to see that.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure we all want to see it.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But isn\u2019t there a bigger issue, sir?\u00a0 Pakistan state-sponsored terror \u2014 is there a roadmap to deal with Pakistan state-sponsored terror?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Boy, you have great reporters.\u00a0 I wish I had reporters like this.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 You\u2019re doing better than anybody I\u2019ve ever heard.\u00a0 Where do you find these reporters?\u00a0 This is a great thing.\nNo, look, you have a great Prime Minister.\u00a0 He\u2019ll solve the problem.\u00a0 I have no doubt about it.\nThank you very much everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 Thank you.\nEND\n12:27 P.M.

EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much everyone.\u00a0 It\u2019s great to be with my friend, Boris Johnson.\u00a0 He just got a position that he\u2019s having a very easy time with.\u00a0 It\u2019s much easier than he thought.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 They\u2019re saying, \u201cIs it tougher or easier?\u201d\u00a0 He said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d \u2014 I guess, what he expected.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s pretty much what you expected.\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:\u00a0 It is.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 And he\u2019s doing a fantastic job.\u00a0 Not easy.\u00a0 But doing a really good job.\u00a0 And I think you\u2019re going to make great progress come October, come November.\u00a0 But great progress for the country, long term.\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:\u00a0 October.\u00a0 October.\u00a0 October the 31st.\u00a0 (Inaudible.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 The results are going to be \u2014 the results are going to start to show in November.\u00a0 But it looks to me like he has made some great progress.\u00a0 So it\u2019s an honor to have him here.\nWe\u2019re going to be discussing trade.\u00a0 We can quadruple our trade with UK.\u00a0 And we can, I think, really do a big job.\u00a0 Bob Lighthizer is here \u2014 our trade representative.\u00a0 Your trade representative is here.\u00a0 And they\u2019re already scheduled today to continue negotiations.\nBut we can have substantially more trade with UK, and we look forward to doing that.\u00a0 So we\u2019ll talk about other things also.\u00a0 It\u2019s great to have you, Boris.\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:\u00a0 Well, thank you very much.\u00a0 It\u2019s great to be here.\u00a0 And I certainly hope that we can make a lot of progress quite fast on trade.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got our Secretary of State for International Trade, Liz Truss, is here.\u00a0 We hope to get going on that, always remembering that the NHS is not for sale.\nBut everything else \u2014 there\u2019s a huge amount we can \u2014 we can do.\nAnd I guess we\u2019ll also talk a bit about Iran \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 We\u2019ll be talking about that.\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:\u00a0 \u2014 and some of those difficult issues where I think we share a common perspective, and we want to dial things down but also make sure that people in the Gulf don\u2019t get the wrong idea about what they can get away with.\u00a0 That\u2019s a complicated issue.\u00a0 We have to make progress there as well.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 We\u2019ll be talking about many things, and we look forward to it.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll start in just a minute.\nSo thank you very much, everybody.\u00a0 Thank you.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prime Minister Johnson, some of your critics are saying that you should resign because you misled the Queen with regard to shutting Parliament down.\u00a0 How do you respond to that?\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:\u00a0 Well, as I said earlier on \u2014 thank you very much.\u00a0 As I said earlier on, let\u2019s be absolutely clear: We respect the judiciary in our country, we respect the court.\nI disagree profoundly with what they had to say.\u00a0 I think it was entirely right to go ahead with a plan for a Queen\u2019s speech.\u00a0 This is a \u2014 with the longest period.\u00a0 We haven\u2019t had a Queen\u2019s speech for 400 years.\u00a0 We\u2019ve got a dynamic domestic agenda we need to be getting on with: more police on the streets, investment in our National Health Service, improving our education.\u00a0 We need to get on with that.\nAnd, frankly, I think we need to get on with Brexit.\u00a0 That\u2019s the overwhelming view of the British people.\u00a0 Whether they voted to leave or remain, they want to get this thing done by October the 31st.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 That was a very nasty question from a great American reporter.\u00a0 I\u2019m shocked.\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:\u00a0 Was that \u2014 no, was that an American reporter?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 That\u2019s an American reporter.\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:\u00a0 Was it?\u00a0 I thought \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 And he\u2019s a good one.\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:\u00a0 But I think he was asking a question, to be fair, that a lot of British reporters would have asked me.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Well, now that we have that out of the way \u2014 he\u2019s not \u2014 I\u2019ll tell you, I know him well: He\u2019s not going anywhere.\u00a0 Don\u2019t worry about him.\nOkay, go ahead.\u00a0 Any other questions?\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any advice for the Prime Minister as to how he should deal with the judges?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 No, I think he\u2019s dealing very well.\u00a0 Everything I see here is what \u2014 look, I\u2019ve watched it very closely.\u00a0 He\u2019s a friend of mine.\u00a0 I tend to watch friends closer than enemies, but the enemies you have to watch in a different way.\nI think he\u2019s doing very well.\u00a0 It\u2019s a complicated subject, but they took a vote, and the vote was \u2014 I was there.\u00a0 I happened to be there the day of that vote.\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:\u00a0 Were you down at the vote?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I made a prediction, even.\u00a0 I even made a prediction.\u00a0 And it was a correct prediction.\u00a0 And, you know, that was a long time ago.\u00a0 And it takes a man like this to get it done.\u00a0 And they have to get it done; otherwise, it would be a terrible thing to do it any other way.\nI don\u2019t see another vote.\u00a0 I don\u2019t see anything happening.\u00a0 I think he\u2019s going to get it done.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, what was your reaction when you heard these UK supreme court decision?\u00a0 What was your reaction to it?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 I had no reaction.\u00a0 I just asked Boris.\u00a0 And, you know, to him, it\u2019s another day in the office.\u00a0 He\u2019s a professional.\u00a0 It\u2019s just another day in the office.\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:\u00a0 Yeah, well, it\u2019s \u2014 tomorrow is another day in Parliament.\u00a0 That\u2019s what he means.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 You know, we had \u2014 we had, Boris, the first couple of months, we had been \u2014 I think we were 0 for 7 with the Supreme Court.\u00a0 And since then, we won the wall, we won asylum, we won some of the biggest ones.\u00a0 We\u2019ve had a great streak going.\nBut we \u2014 we started off, we were 0 for 7.\u00a0 And then as you will report \u2014 in fact, the first time we won, you were, like, shocked that we won.\u00a0 And since then, we\u2019ve almost run the table.\u00a0 We\u2019ve won a lot of decisions.\u00a0 So I\u2019m sure that\u2019s going to happen to you.\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:\u00a0 Well, we\u2019re not counting our chickens.\u00a0 And we\u2019re full of respect, as I say, to the justices of our \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 supreme court.\u00a0 But we\u2019re going to \u2014 we\u2019re going to push on.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to respect what the court had to say, but we\u2019re going to get on and deliver Brexit.\u00a0 That\u2019s the \u2014 I think that\u2019s what the British people want to see.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 In other words, he\u2019s been very nice to the court, please.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 He has \u2014\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President \u2014\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 He has total respect for the court.\nYeah, Jeff.\nQ\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. President, on a separate subject, can you explain why aid to Ukraine was stopped?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\u00a0 Because I think that other countries should be paying also.\u00a0 Why is the United States the only one paying to Ukraine?\u00a0 And I\u2019ve been talking about this for a long time \u2014 not only with respect to Ukraine, but a lot of other countries.\nBut, frankly, why isn\u2019t Germany \u2014 I just met with the Chancellor \u2014 why isn\u2019t Germany, why isn\u2019t France, why aren\u2019t these other countries paying payment?\u00a0 Why are we paying all the time?\u00a0 And nobody has given, I believe, more to Ukraine.\u00a0 You know, President Obama used to send pillows and sheets.\u00a0 I sent anti-tank weapons and a lot of things to Ukraine.\u00a0 We think that it\u2019s very important and \u2014 by the way, I don\u2019t know if you know it or not, that payment was made.\nBut I wanted to get other countries.\u00a0 Other countries should also pay because, frankly, it affects them more.\u00a0 I mean, that\u2019s a barrier.\u00a0 That\u2019s a wall between Russia and the UK.\u00a0 And they don\u2019t pay.\u00a0 And why are they not paying?\u00a0 Why is it always the United States that\u2019s paying?\u00a0 And I made that loud and clear.\u00a0 I told that to Mick Mulvaney.\u00a0 I told it to a lot of people.\u00a0 Where\u2019s Mick?\u00a0 Wherever he is.\u00a0 But I told it to a lot of different people.\u00a0 I told it to Mike.\u00a0 I told it to two Mikes.\u00a0 I told it to Steve.\nI keep asking the same \u2014 I said it to Wilbur Ross.\u00a0 I keep asking the same question: Why is it that the United States is always paying these foreign countries and other foreign countries that, frankly, are much great \u2014 much more affected, and they\u2019re not?\nSo I said, \u201cHold it up.\u00a0 Let\u2019s get other people to pay.\u201d\u00a0 And then everybody called me: \u201cOh, please can we pay?\u201d\u00a0 And I said \u2014 and there was never any quid pro quo.\u00a0 The letter was beautiful.\u00a0 It was a perfect letter.\nIt was \u2014 unlike Biden, who \u2014 by the way, what he said was a horror.\u00a0 And ask how his son made millions of dollars from Ukraine, made millions of dollars from China, even though he had no expertise whatsoever.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 So what he did was a real problem.\u00a0 With us, there was no pressure applied, no nothing.\nOkay, folks.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 Thank you.\nEND\n11:42 A.M.
