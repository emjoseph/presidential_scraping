EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  I think we’re getting ready to do something very exciting.  Jim, do you want to take over?\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  Sure.  So this is a —\nOPERATOR:  Christina and Jessica, please stand by for a call from the President of the United States.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Where’s my camera?\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  (Laughs.)  I guess it’s over to you at this point.\nSir —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Where’s — where’s my camera?  You tell me.  (Laughter.)  There are a lot of cameras.\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  It is.  It’s an exciting day.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It is.\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  The first all-women spacewalk underway right now.  They’re doing very important work.  Just so everybody knows, we’re — this is a short window for the downlink, and also they’ve got very busy work to do.  They’re on the outside of the station.  But what a big day.  We’re thrilled to be here, Mr. President.  It’s over to you for communicating with them.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m thrilled also.  And if they’re ready, I’m ready.\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  Okay.\nMS. TRUMP:  Can we confirm that the link is live?\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  Sir, the link is live.\nAIDE:  The link is live.\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  The link is live.  They’re listening.  They are on the outside of the Space Station.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Station, this is President Donald Trump.  Do you hear me?\nMS. KOCH:  We can hear you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s great.  (Laughter.)  (Applause.)\nMS. TRUMP:  Yes!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s great.  I was starting to get worried about you.  (Applause.)  I was starting to get worried about you.  (Laughter.)  You’re in an interesting place.\nI thought we may have to be — a little emergency work.  I don’t think that will ever be necessary with you.  The job that you do is incredible.\nAnd I’m here with Vice President Mike Pence, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, and my daughter, Ivanka.  We’re thrilled to be speaking live with two brave American astronauts who are making history.\nJoining us during their spacewalk outside the International Space Station — and this is the first time for a woman outside of the Space Station — are Flight Engineers Christina Koch and Flight Engineer Jessica Meir.\nAnd I just want to congratulate you.  What you do is incredible.  It’s so — you’re very brave people.  I don’t think I want to do it, I must tell you that.  But you are amazing people.\nThey’re conducting the first-ever female spacewalk to replace an exterior part of the Space Station.  They’re doing some work, and they’re doing it in a very high altitude — an altitude that very few people will ever see.\nCongratulations, Christina and Jessica, on this historic event.  This is truly historic.  And you’re right now on television all over the world, so don’t get nervous.  (Laughter.)\nI’d like to ask you a question: What would you like to tell everyone listening and watching today, especially young women —\nDR. MEIR:  (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — who are interested in space?\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  There’s about a four- or five-second delay.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Ah, okay.\nDR. MEIR:  Hello.  Thank you.  First — first of all, we don’t want to take too much credit, because there have been many other female spacewalkers before us.  This is just the first time that there have been two women outside at the same time.\nAnd it’s really interesting for us.  We’ve talked a lot about it up here.  You know, for us, this is really just us doing our job.  It’s something we’ve been training for, for six years, and preparing for.  And so, it didn’t really, you know — for us, it’s just coming out here and doing our job today.  And we were the — we were the crew that was tasked with this assignment.\nAt the same time, we recognize that it is a historic achievement, and we do, of course, want to give credit to all of those that came before us.  There has been a long line of female scientists, explorers, engineers, and astronauts, and we have followed in their footsteps to get us where we are today.\nWe hope that we can provide an inspiration to everybody, not only (inaudible), but to everybody that has a dream and has a big dream and that is willing to work hard to make that dream come true — something that all of us that have made our way up here have done all throughout our lives.  And I can tell you, the hard work certainly did pay off.\nI’ve only been up here a few weeks, actually — about three weeks I’ve been in space — and this is my first flight and my very first spacewalk.  So it is a pretty incredible feeling.  I’m sure you can all imagine.  And it’s one that I will never forget.\nI’m extremely fortunate to be sharing this moment with Christina Koch, who’s not only my colleague, but also a very, very close and dear friend.\nSo it’s really our honor to be out here working today and to be representing whatever it is that’s significant to whatever — whatever individuals’ desires and hearts.\nThank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, Christina and Jessica, I would like to, if I could, just thank you.  Jessica, I know that you’ve been doing this and you’ve been working hard.  And, Christina, I’ve studied your résumé.  It’s really incredible what you’ve done, what you’ve both done.  Your lives have been incredible.  And now you’re in a place that, as I said, very few people will ever get that experience.  You’re doing an incredible job.\nThis is a first step — because we’re going to the Moon, and then we’re going to Mars.  We’re launching from the Moon most likely.  They seem to think that’s the best way of doing it, Jim.  So we’re launching from the Moon.\nAnd I just want to congratulate you both.  You’re very brave, brilliant women, and you represent this country so well.  And our country is very proud of you, and we are very proud of you.  Millions and millions of people are watching you right now.  But I will tell you: What you do is really something very special.\nSo, first the Moon, and then we go to Mars.  Thank you both very much.  Have a good time.\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  I’m wondering if we might have lost the link at this time.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know.  Maybe they didn’t like my message.  (Laughter.)  Could be.\nAnyway, two great women.  Two great people.  And, you know, it’s a big danger.  Not easy.  It’s not an easy thing to do.  A lot of people would take a pass on that one.  But they’re great women.\nOPERATOR:  Back to the scoop.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think I heard that.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  There’s the link.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s the link.\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  Oh, that’s the link.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s the end of the link.  So they heard my message and they tried to respond and — (laughter) —\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  It’s space.\nMS. TRUMP:  Not the easiest of phone calls.  (Laughs.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I assume they’re okay.  I assume they’re okay.  Anyway, they’re actually outside of the ship.  So that’s something.  Right?  That’s the first time it’s —\nMS. TRUMP:  The first time since 1969 that a President has spoken to astronauts outside of the spaceship.  So, it’s incredible.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That was a great — that was a great — it’s a great thing.  And when are they coming back?  What’s the timing?\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  So each one is different.  Christina Koch is actually going to be — have the longest single endurance mission.  So she’s going to be on the Space Station for, I think, it’s a little — about 10 months, which the longest —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Wow.\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  — we’ve ever had a woman on the Space Station ever.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  What’s the longest for a man?\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  Three hundred and forty five days.  So —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So why don’t you have the woman break the record?\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  Well, we have a very tight schedule when it comes to windows to get back and forth to the International Space Station.  But that’s within the realm of what is possible.  We’re working on schedules, sir.\nMS. TRUMP:  And next, a woman on the Moon, right?\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  That’s right.  The — by direction of the President, we will have the first man — or, I should say, the first woman and next man on the south pole of the Moon will be Americans.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And what’s your timing on that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we better not say it too fast.  Get it done before you talk about it.  (Laughter.)\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  Okay.  Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Go ahead.\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  The goal is 2024, sir.  We’re at — if all things go according to plan, 2024 is within the realm of what is possible.  And we’re working hard to make that a reality.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And because of the fact that we’ve been there, as I have said to you many times — we’ve been there, a long time ago — it’s really being done as a launch for Mars.  Is that correct?\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  That’s right.  We’re building a habitat in orbit around the Moon — a space station, in orbit around the Moon.  And that will be launching in 2022.\nAnd once that is deployed, that will be modified into a Mars ship that will take us all the way to Mars.  And between now and then, we want to build a sustainable architecture at the Moon.  We need to learn how to live and work on another world for long periods of time.  And then, we go to Mars.  Because when you go to Mars — Earth and Mars, we’re only aligned on the same side of the Sun once every 24 months — or 26 months.  What that means is we have to be willing to stay.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  We need to learn how to live and work on another world.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I see.  Yeah.  Right.\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  So that’s what the Moon is all about.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s going to be very interesting.  Well, it’s very exciting.  Exciting times.  And that whole program was dead when I took it over, when we came into office.  And something that Mike liked very much and I liked very much.  And you’re both doing a fantastic job.  And everybody is doing a fantastic job.  It’s been totally reinvigorated, I think, to a level that it’s never been at.\nAnd we’re also thinking in terms of defense.  We have the Space Force happening.  That’s going along very nicely, as you know.  We’re creating a new force, and it’s called the “Space Force.”  And that’s a big thing.  And that’ll be working along very closely with you.  So that’s beyond going to the Moon and Mars.  That’s also defense of our nation, which is very important.\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  That’s right.  Anywhere there’s commerce, it needs to be defended.  And we are industrializing space.  It’s going to be an export for the United States.  And that’s going to be very positive.  In fact, it already is.  We need to grow it.  And so we’re working very hard to commercialize it, make it an export.  And, of course, that requires it to be defended just like the high seas for trade.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s fantastic.  Thank you very much.  Great job.\nADMINISTRATOR BRIDENSTINE:  Thank you, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much, everybody.  That was very exciting.  And these are two great people.  And they put themselves at risk for our nation and because they love doing it.  And there are few people that have the ability to something like that, I will say that.  It takes a great ability.\nSo thank you all for being here.  It’s very nice.  Thank you.\nQ    Mr. President, do you mind clarifying what Mick Mulvaney said yesterday?  Was the aid —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think he — I think he clarified it.\nQ    — to Ukraine contingent upon investigating the Democrats?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And I do have to say this: We, yesterday, had a tremendous day in Texas.  We opened a Louis Vuitton plant.  One of the great brands of the world.  And they opened it right in the heart of Texas.  Lone Star State.  And then, we went over to Dallas and had an event like few people have ever seen.  We had a packed arena with thousands and thousands of people outside.  It was an incredible evening.  Got back very, very late.\nI did actually get to hear about Ambassador Kent.  This is the witch hunt, you know.  Their — their Crooked Schiff is coming after the Republican Party.  He’s coming after the Republican Party as hard as he can, considering he’s really — he’s been compromised very sadly and badly because of the fact, as you know — I think, as the press knows — he made a statement and he made a virtual speech about what I said, and then it turned out that I didn’t say any of it because he fraudulently made this statement to Congress.\nI thought what he did was one of the worst things.  I understand he has immunity, but he doesn’t have immunity when he puts it on his Twitter, which he did.  And he doesn’t have immunity when he speaks to press, which he did.  And he certainly won’t have immunity if we ever get him into Congress and can swear him under oath.  Because what he did was a very bad thing.\nBut what just happened is, Ambassador Kent — who I have never had the privilege, I don’t believe, of meeting; I don’t know him — and they brought him in as a witness against me, even though I don’t know him.  And he excoriated, from what they reported on the news — and, of course, maybe, in this case, it won’t be fake news — but he excoriated the Obama administration and Joe Biden and Joe Biden’s son, saying that he has tremendous problems — tremendous problems with Joe Biden’s son and the Ukraine.\nSo he’s got tremendous problems with Biden’s son and Ukraine.  And it’s inappropriate.  And all of the horrible things — I mean, you could get it; you could see it.  It’s been a big deal.  And I heard Schiff is going, “No, no.  We don’t want to talk about that.  We don’t want to talk about that.”  But he talked about it.  And it’s one of those things.  So, this is a terrible witch hunt.  This is so bad for our country.\nI just spoke to President Erdoğan of Turkey.  We’re doing very, very well with Turkey.  There’s a ceasefire, or a pause, or whatever you want to call it.  There was some sniper fire this morning.  There was mortar fire this morning that was eliminated quickly.  And they’re back to the full pause.\nWe have ISIS totally under guard.  Turkey is also guarding, separately.  They’re watching over everything.  So you have the Kurds, who we’re dealing with and are very happy about the way things are going, I must say.  The Kurds.  And you also have the Turks watching, just secondarily watching.  So we have ISIS under control.\nWe’ve taken control of the oil in the Middle East, the oil that we’re talking about; the oil that everybody was worried about.  We have — the U.S. has control of that.  And there are no shots being fired.  And a lot of people are doing a lot of things.\nThis is a deal that should have been made 15 years ago, 10 years ago, over the last number of years, under the Obama administration.  The real number is over a million people were killed.  We have lost no — not a drop of blood since we’ve started what I’ve started.  And it was — so far, it’s working out.\nLook, it’s a complicated region.  Many, many people have gone down.  I have to watch in great interest as I see people talking about what we should be doing.  And these are the same people that have been failing for the last 20 years, didn’t know what they were doing, especially when they went in and did what they did.  They shouldn’t have been there.\nBut we’re doing a very, very significant amount of great work.  We’ll see if it works.  It’s very fragile.  It’s been fragile for years.  They’ve been fighting each other for centuries.  Literally, for centuries, they’ve been fighting each other.  And years ago, we injected ourselves right into the middle of it.  And we won’t go into whether or not that was a good thing or a bad thing.  You know how I feel about it.\nBut we’ve had tremendous success, I think, over the last couple of days.  A little bit unconventional, a little bit of hard love.  I told you that.  A little — there was a lot — a lot of pain for a couple of days.  And sometimes you have to go through some pain before you can get a good solution.  But the Kurds are very happy about it.  President Erdoğan and Turkey is satisfied with it.  And we are in a very strong position.\nWe are also in a position where we can put tremendous, powerful sanctions on Turkey or whoever else we want to.  Our country is a financially much stronger country than when I took it over.  China would have been, right now, the strongest economy in the world, the number-one economy in the world.  And right now, China is way behind us.  We picked up trillions of dollars in value, in worth.  And they’ve lost trillions and trillions of dollars.  And they’re having the worst year they’ve had in 57 years.\nWith that being said, we’re working with China very well.  We’ve done, subject to getting it signed — and I think it will get signed quite easily, hopefully by the summit in Chile, where President Xi and I will both be.\nBut a lot of good things are happening.  Our farmers are taken care of.  Our bankers and financial services are going to have access, the likes of which they’ve never had to — the largest or second largest, depending on your definitions.  About 1.4 billion people, population, whether it’s India or China.  They’re pretty close.  And we’ve done some great things.\nSo, we had — but, I just want to say, I want to thank the people of Dallas and the people of Fort Worth and the people of Texas, because yesterday was incredible.\nI want to thank Bernard Arnault, one of the great businessmen of the world, for agreeing to do something that was a first.  He’s built this incredible plant right in our great state of Texas.  And they’re going to make super luxury and super product.  They have already started.  It’s opened.  A big investment.  And we’re very proud of it.\nThat was done with me and with the election with — even prior to the election, I said, “You have to open up a plant someplace in the United States.”  He said, “What do you think about Texas?”  I said, “I love Texas.  That would be good.”  And I said, “If you do it, I’ll be there.”  And so I fulfilled that commitment.  But he opened up a beautiful plant.  We think over 1,000 people will soon be working there.\nSo, thank you all very much.  Yesterday was a big day.  We had a great talk with President Erdoğan, and it’s going very well.  Thank you very much.\nEND\n12:45 P.M.

CDT\nQ    Hello, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Hello.  How are you?  Okay.  She’s good.\nQ    Do you have a special relationship with Mr. Arnault?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I do.  And he was so nice to me.  And I said, “I’d love you to open up something in Texas or someplace in the U.S.”  And he’s a great gentleman, a great businessman.  And he’s really an artist.  To me, Bernard is an artist.  And what he’s done is incredible, not only here, but in terms of the branding — the world of brands.  And it’s an honor to have him in Texas.  And he’s going to be very happy.\nQ    Thank you.  Tomorrow, there will be tariffs on European products.  Why do you want to tax French wines and French cheese?  And why won’t you tax Mr. Arnault’s handbags or champagne?  For example —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I can’t tax him because he moved to the United States.  So he was —\nQ    Did you discuss it?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He was way ahead.  I actually did discuss it.  He has no tariffs whatsoever because he’s in the United States.  So we’re very happy about that.  Very happy.\nQ    What about the wines and the cheese?  Why —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, that’s a different story, but —\nQ    Sure.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  But they owe us a lot of money.  Thank you very much.\nQ    Do you have confidence in Mick Mulvaney, Mr. President?\nQ    Did you watch Mick Mulvaney’s press conference, Mr. President?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I didn’t.  I wasn’t able to see it.\nQ    Are you aware that he suggested that there was some sort of a quid pro quo involved in Ukraine?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I didn’t.  I heard he — somebody said he did a very nice job.\nQ    Do you know when Rick Perry is going to leave?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You know what I’ve been focused on today, very much?  All of this, and also, if you look, Turkey and the great thing that happened in Syria.\nI don’t know.  But Mick is a good man.  I don’t know.  I have not heard anything about that.\nQ    Do you still have confidence in Mick?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I have a lot of confidence.\nQ    About Syria, Mr. Trump, are you very satisfied with the ceasefire?  Is it the end of the crisis?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think this is beautiful.  I really think this is beautiful.  I think the plant is incredible, and a great company.  Thank you very much.\nQ    Mr. President, did Rick Perry offer his resignation to you, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I know Rick has been with me three years.  He’s right here.  He’s with us, right here.  And he’s been outstanding.  And we already have his replacement.  Rick has a done a fantastic job in energy.  But it was time.  Yeah, three years is a long time.  And he’ll be leaving toward the end of the year — at the end of the year.\nBut his — in fact, I was going to announce it tonight at the rally in Texas.\nQ    Who are you looking at?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We have the man that we’re going to — it’s a man, in this case, we’re going to be putting in Rick’s place.  We’ll be announcing it very shortly.  Okay?\nHow are you?  How are you?  Good job, you do.\nQ    About the ceasefire, Mr. Trump, it’s a big deal.  How did you manage to get it?  Is it the end of the crisis?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  This is a great deal.  This is a great deal for Texas and for our country.  And to have this incredible company and brand in Texas is an honor for all us.\nQ    No, but I mean with Syria.  What you got today —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re very happy.  And I want to thank President Erdoğan of Turkey.  I want to thank all of the leaders of the Kurds.  Many people came into store for this.  And it was unconventional, but they saw that was not working out, what they were doing.  And we’re very happy with the way that worked out.  Very, very successful.\nAnd now, over the next number of days, things are going to happen that are going to be very positive.  There’s a lot of goodwill going on right now in Turkey with the Kurds and with everybody involved.  Many, many people are involved.  But I want to thank Mike Pence.  I want to thank Mike Pompeo.  They did a fantastic job.  All of my representatives who went over there two days ago, late in the evening, and got there — and not easy to do, and little bit dangerous to do, also — they did a fantastic job.\nQ    And do you think it’s solved?  It’s over?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, I do.  I think it’ll all work out now.  I think they needed an unconventional touch.  And I am very unconventional, right?\nQ    Were you surprised by Rick Perry’s announcement — decision?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I knew six months ago.  He told me at the end of the year he’d like to go.  And he’s got some ideas for doing something else.  He’s a terrific guy.  He’s here with us now.  Here’s here.  He’s right here.\nQ    Can we talk to him?\nQ    So what happened on the plane today?  Did he just formalize it and hand you the letter?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  With what?  Rick?\nQ    Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, no.  Rick and I have been talking for six months.  In fact, I thought he might go a little bit sooner.  But he’s got some very big plans.  He’s going to be very successful.  We have his successor.  We’ll announce it pretty soon.\nQ    Is it Governor Abbott?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He’d be a good one.\nQ    Is it the Governor of Alaska?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I’ll tell you, he would be a — they would be both be very good.  No, it’s not.  But they both would be very good.\nQ    Do you have any comment, sir, for Fort Worth, on the death of Atatiana Jefferson, the woman who was found killed in her home?  You just came from Fort Worth.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I think it was terrible.  I think it was a terrible thing.\nQ    You have very low unemployment rate in the U.S., and we have a very high unemployment rate in France.  How come?  What’s the recipe for —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, maybe we have a better President than you do.  (Laughter.)\nQ    Are you any closer to sending Anne Sacoolas back to the UK?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.\nEND\n5:03 P.M.

CEST\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, hello, Ramstein!  (Applause.)  Thank you all for being up so late.  I just couldn’t pass through without having a chance to meet as many of you as I could.  To General Jeffrey Harrigian, Lieutenant General Steven Basham, Major General John Wood, Colonel Matthew Husemann, but most especially to all of the outstanding men and women wearing the uniform of the United States Air Force and all of our Armed Forces: Thank you for coming out tonight.  And thank you for your service.  (Applause.)\nIt really is an honor to be back — to be back at Ramstein Air Base with the men and women of the 435th Air Ground Operations Wing — (applause) — the 521st Air Mobility Operations Wing — (applause) — and, of course, the enduring courage of the 86th Airlift Wing.  (Applause.)\nYou know, I know it’s awful late here tonight, y’all stayed up late to see me, and I’m very honored by that.  I really am.  Giving me this warm welcome to Ramstein.  So — I don’t know about you, General Harrigian, but it looks to me like these airmen might just have earned a three-day weekend.  What do you say?  (Applause.)  I had to suggest it.  (Laughter.)\nBut speaking of people that admire all of you, allow me to bring greetings tonight from a great admirer of all the men and women who wear the uniform of the Armed Forces of the United States, a great champion of our military and their families.  I bring greetings from your Commander-in-Chief, the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.  (Applause.)\nAnd I’m looking forward to meeting as many of you as time permits tonight.  But I really just wanted to stop by, on behalf of your President and his Vice President, and a grateful nation, to deliver a very simple message to each and every one of you:  The United States Armed Forces is the greatest force for good the world has ever known.  And you are that force.  (Applause.)\nAnd I promise you, men and women, your Commander-in-Chief, his number two, and the American people are proud of you.  This country is more thankful for the service that you render every day than you will ever know.  But, first and foremost, thank you for your service.\nYou know, many people spend all their lives wondering if — if they’ve made a difference.  But you’ll never have that problem.  Because each and every one you stepped up.  You raised your right hand.  You swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America and defend the American people.  You chose to be a part of something larger than yourselves.  You joined this all-volunteer military.  And as the Good Book says: You did not love your lives so much as to shrink from this calling.\nTruthfully, the day you took that oath, you decided that our lives were more important than yours.  And I want you to know the American people understand that and admire you deeply.  You have chosen to do your part to keep the flame of freedom alive.  And I want you to know that you have your Commander-in-Chief’s and my own deepest respect for your courage and your valor.  So give yourselves a round of applause because America is proud of you.  (Applause.)\nThe truth is, you come from the rest of us, but you are the best of us — heroes all.  And I’m here not only to say thank you for your service, but to also assure you that you have a Commander-in-Chief who will always have your back.  I truly believe, serving alongside him every single day, that President Donald Trump is the greatest friend the United States Armed Forces have ever had.  (Applause.)\nI mean, from the earliest days of our administration, our President has taken decisive action to make the strongest military in the history of the world stronger still.\nIn our first year in office, President Trump signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan, including the biggest pay raise for our troops in more than 10 years.  And you deserved every single penny.  (Applause.)\nAs the President said not long ago, our active-duty personnel are now the best-equipped, best-trained, and most technologically advanced fighting force in the history of the world.  And it’s true.  And with this renewed American strength, we’re once again embracing America’s role as leader of the free world.\nUnder this President’s leadership, and by virtue of your service, we’re standing with our allies and we’re standing up to our enemies.\nHere in Europe, I’m proud to report that our NATO Allies are contributing more to our common defense than ever before.  (Applause.)  As the home of the United States Air Forces-Europe, your service here at this historic base supports NATO missions all over the world.  You support our armed forces, our allies, and our partners on three continents, it’s amazing to think, and 124 countries.  And you make it possible to move troops and supplies wherever they need to be, anywhere in the world, 24/7, 365 days a year.\nRamstein Air Base is the heart of the American military on the European continent, and the free world is safer because of all of you.  (Applause.)\nAnd speaking of security, I’m pleased to report to all of my fellow Americans that, just a few hours ago, at President Trump’s direction, we concluded a successful negotiation in Turkey that directly impacts missions that you support here at Ramstein Air Base every day.\nAs you all know, one week ago, Turkish forces crossed into Syria.  Earlier this week, President Trump took decisive action and called on Turkey to stand down, to end the violence, and agree to come to the table for negotiations.\nAnd today, I’m proud to report, thanks to the President’s strong leadership, the United States and Turkey have agreed to a ceasefire in Syria.  (Applause.)\nAnd I know all of you here at Ramstein Air Base have been vital to our mission in that region for years.  The progress that we made today, I believe, is directly owing to the work that all of you have labored so nobly to advance here.\nYou played a vital role in the campaign to defeat ISIS.  And today, we have a framework for peace in that region of Syria that will bring security to our allies in Turkey, our allies in Syrian Defence Forces, and it’ll advance peace and security for all the men, women, and children who have suffered for years of war and terror.  It is progress being built on your service here at Ramstein.\nAs you stand your post, I want you to know that your Commander-in-Chief, and all of the American people, are behind you 100 percent.\nYou know, I say that from a grateful heart, but I also say that with true humility.  It’s always humbling for me to stand before men and women who wear that the uniform of the United States because my life did not take me into service in our armed forces.  I’m proud to say I’m the son of a combat veteran from the Korean War in the Army.  And Karen and I are the proud parents of a United States Marine.  (Applause.)  And if it helps, my daughter just got engaged to a Navy pilot.  So I’ll soon be the father-in-law of a Naval aviator as well.\nBut, you know, as I stand before you today, I often think it might be altogether fitting for an American like me to come before you, simply to speak a word of gratitude — not so much as your Vice President, but just as a fellow American; a fellow American who lives under the umbrella of protection that you provide from here in Ramstein and across the free world, every day.\nBut I want to leave you with this admonition, even at this late hour.  On behalf of your Commander-in-Chief, I want to urge all of you: Mind your mission, stay sharp, be vigilant, respect the unified chain of command, take care of each other — especially those under your command — and you will succeed in serving this country with distinction.\nAnd as you do this, never doubt for one second that the service that you render here on this continent so far from home matters more to the American people than you will ever know.\nThe American people are grateful for your service because we know that your service comes with sacrifice for you and for your families.  You’ve stepped forward in a calling that has, as I said before, counted our lives more important than your own.\nBut I want to assure you, as you go forth, defending America and defending freedom here at this outpost in Europe: In those times that it may seem a little too far from home, and those times that you may — you may feel a sense of loneliness or separation, just know that you do not bear this burden you carry alone.\nAs you serve here, I want to assure you that wherever you are called to serve, wherever you are deployed, you will carry with you the strength and pride of the American people.  You will carry with you the confidence of your Commander-in-Chief.  And I also know that, every day, you are carried by the prayers of the American people.\nI know, as I travel across this country, when I’m home, that the prayers of the faithful carry the men and women of our armed forces every day.  The American people will continue to pray as you serve and protect our nation.\nWe pray that, as the Old Book says, “No harm would befall you, no plague would come near your tent,” and that as you serve on the ground or in the skies that His — that, “He would command his angels concerning you to watch over you in all your ways.”  And that’ll be our prayer, as I know it is the prayer of millions.\nSo, to the men and women of Ramstein Air Base, thank you for staying up so late to greet your Vice President.  I’m honored to be with you today.  I look forward to meeting as many of you as time permits.\nBut I have to tell you, I leave here today, even at this hour, with renewed confidence, looking at all your shining faces and the grit and resolve that I see in your eyes.  And I know, as long as we have men and women like you with the courage to step forward and serve; as long as we have heroes willing to put your lives on the line for freedom; as long as we have patriots, like all of you, to defend our nation, I know America will be safe, our freedom will be secure, and the best days for the greatest nation on Earth are yet to come.\nSo, God bless you.  God bless Ramstein Air Base.  And God bless America.  Thanks.  (Applause.)\nEND\n1:17 A.M.

        "text": "Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort WorthFort Worth, Texas\n1:17 P.M. CDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  I’m very happy to report tremendous success, with respect to Turkey.  And I want to thank President Erdoğan.  I want to thank our Vice President Mike Pence, our Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  Great job.  All of the people that we sent over the last three days.  We sent an early group.\nThis is an amazing outcome.  This is an outcome — regardless of how the press would like to damp it down, this was something that they’ve been trying to get for 10 years.  You would have lost millions and millions of lives.  They couldn’t get it without a little rough love, as I called it.  I just put out — they needed a little bit of that at the beginning.  And then everybody said, “Wow, this is tougher than we thought.”  When those guns start shooting, they tend to do things.\nBut I will tell you, on behalf of the United States, I want to thank Turkey.  I want to thank all of the people that have gotten together and made this happen.  This is an incredible outcome.\nSo you have a 22-mile strip.  And for many, many years, Turkey — in all fairness, they’ve had a legitimate problem with it.  They had terrorists.  They had a lot of people in there that they couldn’t have.  They’ve suffered a lot of loss of lives also.  And they had to have it cleaned out.  But once you start that, it gets to be to a point where a tremendous amount of bad things can happen.\nSo a process started and we started to negotiate.  And I think that, obviously, the sanctions and tariffs were going to be very biting.  I’m glad we don’t have to do it.  We’ll be taking them off very quickly, as soon as this is finalized.\nBut this is an incredible outcome.  This outcome is something they’ve been trying to get for 10 years — everybody — and they couldn’t get it, other administrations.  And they never would’ve been able to get it unless you went somewhat unconventional.  I guess I’m an unconventional person.\nI took a lot of heat from a lot of people, even some of the people in my own party, but they were there.  In the end, they were there.  They’re all there.  Look, this is about the nation.  This isn’t about Republicans or Democrats.  This is about our nation.\nSo, we have a five-day ceasefire.  During that five days, the Kurds and other people — they’re going to be taken great care of.  They’re going to be moving around — moving out of a safe zone, which is something that Turkey has always wanted.\nThe ISIS — they call them “Daesh,” but we call them “ISIS.”  The ISIS fighters that we have captured, they’ll be under very, very strict control of various different groups.  But we will be watching, we will be in charge, and they’ll be under very, very powerful and strict control.  And we’ve gotten everything we could’ve ever dreamed of, and we’re also going to be able to bring our people back home.  But we’ll be able to have control of ISIS — total.  We’ll be able to do whatever we have to do to get the rest of ISIS, wherever they may be.  They’re never going to be ruling us.\nAnd I want to thank everybody.  And the other thing, I want thank — as a group, I want to thank the Kurds because they were incredibly happy with this solution.  This is a solution that really — well, it saved their lives, frankly.  It saved their lives.\nSo we’ve done a great thing for our partner.  If we didn’t go this unconventional, tough-love approach, you could’ve never gotten it done.  They’ve been trying to do this for many, many years.  You could’ve never gotten it done.\nSo, I want to thank everybody.  I want to thank everybody back in Washington.\nWe’re in Texas now and we’re going to be opening up a phenomenal new plant.  One of the greatest men in business — in all of business — is here with us.  You know who he is.\nAnd they’re opening up a plant in Texas.  The first time, I believe — one of the great companies of the world — first time ever in the United States.  And then we’re having a big rally in Dallas tonight at the American Airlines Center.  So we look forward to that.  We’ve been — they’ve been standing on line for three days, as you know.  So it’s a record crowd over in Dallas.\nBut I didn’t know it was going to work out this quickly.  I didn’t know it would work out this well.  It’s a great day for the United States.  It’s a great day for Turkey.  It’s a great day for our partners, who have really worked.  I mean, a lot of people questioned some of them; I’m not questioning anybody.  They really did.  The Kurds were great.  It’s a great day for the Kurds.  It’s really a great day for civilization.  It’s a great day for civilization.\nSo I just want to thank everybody.\nQ    Do you expect Congress now to call off their sanctions effort?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, sanctions won’t be necessary because Turkey is doing what they’re doing.  I didn’t need Congress for sanctions because I can do sanctions that are tougher than Congress.  And I was prepared to do that.\nI just want to thank and congratulate though, President Erdoğan.  He’s a friend of mine and I’m glad we didn’t have a problem.  Because, frankly, he’s a hell of a leader, and he’s a tough man.  He’s a strong man.  And he did the right thing, and I really appreciate it.  And I will appreciate it in the future.\nQ    Mr. President, isn’t Turkey getting everything they want from this?  Don’t they effectively just get control of the safe zone?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, Turkey has a great military power.  Turkey is a friend of ours, a neighbor of ours, and they’re a member of NATO.  And what Turkey is getting now is they’re not going to have to kill millions of people, and millions of people aren’t going to have to kill them.\nI mean, this was going to be a war of lots of other groups coming in; this wasn’t going to stop with Turkey against the Kurds.  A lot of different groups were coming in.  We might not have been involved.  I don’t want to be involved in that kind of a war.\nAnd, by the way, we have the strongest military in the world.  But we’ve been there for 10 years.  We’ve been in the Middle East for nineteen and a half years.  So this was a great thing for everybody.  And Turkey is — I really appreciate what they’ve done.  They did the right thing.  And I have a great respect for the President.\nQ    Your decision not to keep any of the sanctions in place — doesn’t that effectively let Turkey just get off with no punishment for this incursion?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No.  No.  If you let this go, you would’ve lost millions of lives.  Don’t forget: Your friend, President Obama, lost more than a half a million lives in a very short period in the same reason — region.  We’ve lost very little.\nBut without that gunfire going back and forth, without those rockets going in both directions, without other countries moving in, and potentially moving in and creating virtually a world war — without all of that happening, you would’ve never been able to make this deal.\nWe’ve tried — we have tried, but everybody has tried to make this deal for 15 years.  They could never do it.  It was only when it started — people started seeing how nasty it was going to be.  It was going to be very nasty.  Not only sanctions and tariffs, the war itself would’ve been very nasty.\nSo, they did things that they wouldn’t have done.  I just put out.  Everything agreed to things that, three days ago, they would have never agreed to.  That includes the Kurds.  The Kurds are now much more inclined to do what has to be done.  Turkey is much more inclined to do what has to be done.  Turkey wouldn’t have done this three days ago.  The Kurds would not have done it three days ago.\nThis is a situation where everybody is happy.  And I’m happy because there’s no fighting.  We can bring certainly most of our people back home for the first time in many years.\nQ    Mr. President, you’re talking about all of this shooting as though it was part of plan.  Are you saying that you planned for these people to attack each other so you could resolve it?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No.  No.  But I do think this, David: I think it had to be an unconventional solution.  Because the conventional solution is to sit down, negotiate, and they’ve done that for 15 years.  Actually more than that, I understand.  And that was never going to work.\nBut all of a sudden when they saw — and how nasty it was and how rough it would get; it would get 100 times worse than what was happening.  But when they saw the level of nastiness, they said, “Let’s make a deal — everybody together.  Let’s make a deal.”\nQ    Are you sure that this will last more than five days?  A lot of stuff can disappear in five days.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think so.  I think it’s going to last.  I think that President Erdoğan is very smart.  I think he wants it to last.  He wants safety for his people.\nLook, say what you want.  A lot of bad things happened to Turkey from that district, from that 22-mile stretch.  A lot of people in Turkey were killed.  So that’s not fair.  Nobody likes to mention that.  This was a great thing for the Kurds.  This was a great thing for Turkey.  This is great for everybody.\nAnd, frankly, the thing that I’m most happy about is that we were — I took a lot of heat — but that we were able to do it so fast.  I thought this would go on for longer.  This was such a smart thing to get it done so fast.\nQ    Is President Erdoğan still coming next month to the White House?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, now I would say that would be very much open.  I would say that, yeah, he would come.  He did a terrific thing.  He’s a leader.  He’s a leader.  He had to make a decision.  A lot of people wouldn’t have made that decision because they don’t know; they ultimately would’ve made it.  But what he did was very smart and it was great for the people of Turkey.  And they’re lucky it was him that was making the decision, I will tell you that.\nQ    The U.S. military — will you leave anybody in this zone to help monitor this ceasefire?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  We’re going to have people that watch it.  And most particularly, we’re going to have people that are watching ISIS.  We’ll have people watching.  And ISIS will be largely again controlled by the Kurds.  Because what a lot of people don’t know: Most of the areas where ISIS is, is outside of the war zone or the 22 miles.\nSo ISIS will be — very few have gotten out.  Most of them have been recaptured.  And what’s happened is ISIS is outside of the war zone.  So that’s going to be controlled very much by the Kurds, with our supervision.\nQ    And the Kurdish general, General Mazloum, who you talked to before — are you going to talk to him again to get him to —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He’s very happy.  They’ve spoken to him.  The Kurds are very happy.  Turkey is very happy.  The United States is very happy.  And you know what?  Civilization is very happy.  It’s a great thing for civilization.\nThank you, everybody.\nEND\n",

CDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody.  Very, very much appreciated.  We’ve had a tremendous day today in the Middle East.  We were a little bit unconventional, and we did something that nobody has been able to do for many, many years.  They’ve been trying to put things together.  So we went the unconventional way, and they had some fighting and they said, “We don’t like this fighting too much.  This is a little more difficult than people thought.”\nBut I want to thank President Erdoğan of Turkey, and I want to thank the Kurds and Kurd leadership.  I want to thank certain other countries that, behind the scenes, were helping us out.  And it’s a tremendous thing.\nISIS is totally under control, and we’re continuing to capture more.  We have a tremendous situation worked out in so many different ways.  And it’s an honor to have been involved in it.\nI want to thank Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Pompeo.  They traveled through the night.  I don’t know how safe this travel was.  I had a lot of different reports going on.  But they got there, and they did a fantastic job.\nWe sent some early representatives to the site and the area where they negotiated, and we made a deal that’s, I think, in the best interest of civilization.  It’s beyond Turkey and beyond Syria and beyond all of the countries that could have been involved in a disastrous war where millions of people could’ve been killed.  Millions and millions of people could’ve been killed.  And we were able to do something, and I think we’ll get it done, and I think now we get it done.\nSo we have a pause for a period of time — a ceasefire, a pause.  And during that pause, a lot of things are happening.  Already, they’re starting to happen.  People want to see it happen.  And it was a great thing.  So I just wanted to thank everybody.\nAnd, Bernard, I want to thank you for the incredible job you do.  You’re one of the truly great business people but, really, visionaries.  It’s much more than a business person.  I know a lot of great business people, but they’re not necessarily visionaries.  There are very few.  You’re an artist and a visionary, and I want to congratulate you because this is a great vision that you had for the state of Texas and for our country.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.\nToday, we continue the extraordinary revival of American manufacturing, and we proudly celebrate the opening of the brand-new Louis Vuitton — a name I know very well.  (Laughter.)  It cost me a lot of money over the years.  (Laughter.)  It’s a workshop right here in Johnson County, Texas.\nWe’re honored to be joined today — (applause) — thank you.  We’re honored to be joined today by some of the great members of my Cabinet.  They wanted to be here.  This is a very important event.  And we really do — we work very hard on jobs.  Our country is setting records on jobs in so many ways.\nWe have Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.  Wilbur, thank you.  (Applause.)  Labor Secretary Gene Scalia.  Gene.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you, Gene.  And a very good friend of mine who’s been with me right from the beginning, and somebody that’s going to be going, I guess, at the end of the year.  I’m going to miss you so much.  A man who has been your long-term, talented governor, Energy Secretary Rick Perry.  Rick, fantastic job.  (Applause.)  Fantastic.  Stand up, Rick.  He’s done a fantastic job for a long period of time, and we really appreciate it.\nThe Department of Energy has far, far progressed from those days three years ago when you took it over.  So, thank you very much.  We’ll be announcing the replacement.  And he, I think — it’s a “he” in this particular case — I think he’ll do a fantastic job.  We worked on that together.  Right, Rick?  So thank you very much.\nAlso joining us is your great Congressman, Roger Williams — a friend of mine, a very brave gentleman, too.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Roger.  And — is this your territory, Roger, huh?  Wow.  I’ve known him for so long, and now I go to your territory.  Now I see why they like you, and I know why they like you, Roger.  Thank you very much.\nREPRESENTATIVE WILLIAMS:  They like you too.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I hope so.  They better.  (Laughter.)  It’s Texas.  They like me in Texas, I will say.\nAnd our terrific U.S. Ambassador to France, Jamie McCourt.  Jamie, thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Great job.\nBut we’re especially grateful to Bernard and everyone at Louis Vuitton and the Louis Vuitton family: Alexander — I’ve gotten to know Alexander.  He is going to be something.  I don’t know, he may surpass you.  Do you mind that?  No, I don’t think so, right?  (Laughter.)  He’s a special young man.  And Global Chairman — thank you very much, Alexander.  Where are you?  We don’t lose him much with that height.  Well, how tall are you, Alex?  (Laughter.)  Huh?  Great.  Great.  Thank you very much.  Great job you’re doing.\nAnd Global Chairman and CEO Michael Burke.  Michael, thank you very much.  Good job.  (Applause.)  Been with the company a long time, I understand.  Four-oh?  Is that true?  Forty?  Forty years.  He said before, he was as tall as Alexander when he started.  (Laughter.)  Great job.\nAnd Chairman and CEO for North America, Anish Melwani.  Where is — thank you very much.  Great job you do.  (Applause.)\nAlso, the President and CEO of Louis Vuitton Americas Zone, Lanessa Elrod.  Thank you, Lanessa.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.\nI want to thank you all for your confidence in the United States and your confidence and investment in the Lone Star State, the great state of Texas.  You’ll be very happy.  You’ll be very, very happy.\nAs Bernard mentioned, we met shortly after the election to discuss my vision for creating an American manufacturing renaissance through historic tax cuts, and better trade deals, and deregulation.  And we’re making trade deals like nobody has ever seen before.  We just did one with China, phase one.  We’ll get it signed very quickly, for the farmers.  Far, far bigger than anyone ever thought possible.  Also, financial services and many other things.\nBut the trade deals we’ve made with South Korea, with Mexico, Canada — assuming the Democrats ever get it passed, which is a question, because they don’t seem to like to make deals very much.  They have to get that one done.  That’s a very important transaction, the USMCA.  And we’re — and has tremendous support.\nWe’re joined also by Jared and Ivanka, who are both here today as — where is Ivanka?  Jared?  Stand up.  What a good job you do.  (Applause.)  Even though they’re related to me, just slightly, I will tell you, what a job.  Ivanka is responsible for 14 million jobs this year, over the last couple of years, with companies going out and training people.  And it’s been an incredible success.\nShe started off two and a half years ago; she wanted 500,000 jobs.  That’s a lot.  But it was typical Ivanka.  It ended up — and now, the number, I think it just crossed 14 million jobs going to Walmart, going to ExxonMobil, going to the great companies.  And they train people.  And the numbers are incredible, and that’s one of the reasons that our numbers are so good.  Thank you very much.\nAnd, Jared, great job you’re doing.  Thank you very much, both.\nBernard had faith in that vision — the vision of doing something right here in this incredible state — and promised to bring a brand-new factory to the United States.  And today, wow, has he delivered.  He’s really delivered.  This is some place.\nJohnson County is home to some of the hardest-working patriots in America.  Louis Vuitton’s 50-million-dollar investment will be especially big and especially incredible to the small town of Alvarado, a community of fewer than 5,000 people.  And this workshop, as they call it — it’s a very big workshop — it’s a great name though, actually.  I could learn something from you about branding.  I like that.  (Laughter.)  The “workshop.”\nBut this workshop will soon employ 500 of the most highly skilled workers anywhere in the world.  No one can match the precision and perfection of an American artisan.\nWorkers here will have great pay, quality healthcare, 401(k)s.  And, by the way, the 401(k), since my election, have gone through the roof.  And nobody wants to see them be cut in half, go down 82 percent.  They’re going to go up.  They’re only going in one direction, but they are up 70, 80, 82, 91 percent.  They’ve been up.  And when they go and get to go and press that lever to vote for who — I have a feeling we’re going to do very well — very well — as we’ve done in Texas and as we did in 2016, in Texas.  One of the reasons I love this state so much.  And also, profit sharing.\nEvery year, Louis Vuitton will pay more than $26 million in wages, and that number will increase even higher as the facility doubles to 1,000 workers in a very short period of time.\nEvery purse, handbag, and piece of luggage produced here in Johnson County will be made by hand, and it will bear the symbol of excellence envied all around the world.  And it will also have “Made in the USA” stamped on it.  So, we appreciate that.  (Applause.)  Appreciate that.  Made in the USA.\nUnder my administration, we believe that we can build it, grow it, or make it in the United States.  And we are doing that in record numbers.\nToday, we have more people working in the United States that have ever worked in our country before.  Almost 160 million people working with jobs and doing well.\nAfter losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, we have now gained nearly 10,000 new factories under my administration in just a very short period of time.  And they’re coming in, in droves.\nLast year, we saw the biggest increase in manufacturing jobs in more than two decades.  Investments like the one we celebrate today have given the United States the hottest economy anywhere on Earth.  Nobody close.\nSince the election, we have created more than 6.4 million jobs.  We have gained 775,000 new jobs here in Texas, including more than 70,000 manufacturing jobs.  Nearly 7 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.  Median household income has increased by $1,400 to a new all-time high.  And median — I don’t know if you’ve seen this, but it was out yesterday — median household income, it’s more than $5,000 higher, and that doesn’t include the tax cuts, which is another $2,000.  That’s something.  (Applause.)  That’s something.\nUnemployment is at the lowest rate in more than half a century.  African American and Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country.\nThe Texas unemployment rate is the lowest in our history.  And I don’t know if the governor is here right now.  He’s going to be joining me in a little while.  But our governor has done a great job.  Our lieutenant governor has done a fantastic job.\nOur senators — I mean, we have really — we’ve got some fantastic people: Ken, everybody.  We’ve really done a brilliant job.  Led by the former governor, as we said.  Because Rick was — what were you?  Twelve years, Rick, right?  Twelve years as the — how much?\nSECRETARY PERRY:  (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  Good.  Okay.  Good.  I thought you corrected me.  (Laughter.)  I hate to be corrected.  I’m glad I was — glad I was right.\nThese amazing achievements are the result of a policy that puts American workers first.  Since our tax cuts and regulation cuts, American companies have brought nearly $1 trillion back to our shores — money that could never have come back.  It was restricted.  Would never have come back.  Over a trillion — actually, it’s now over a trillion dollars.\nWe’ve ended the war on American energy.  America is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, with Texas producing 30 percent more natural gas and 60 percent more oil.  And that means more jobs, higher wages, and lower prices at the pump.  It’s an incredible number.\nWe’re forging a new trade agenda based on fairness and reciprocity — maybe my favorite word: “reciprocal” trade.  That includes replacing NAFTA — which was a terrible deal — with a brand-new USMCA, which, if adopted, will be a massive win for the state of Texas, its ranchers, its growers, producers, farmers, and factory workers.\nCompanies around the world are realizing that there’s never been a better time to hire, invest, build, and grow in the United States of America.  This is the hottest time we’ve ever had.  It’s incredible what’s happening in our country.\nTo maintain our nation’s competitive advantage, my administration started the Pledge to American Workers.  Thanks to, again, Ivanka’s leadership, in this case, private sector partners are going to be producing many, many more jobs over a very short period of time.\nAnd today, I’m pleased to announce that Louis — Louis Vuitton is also signing the Pledge, ensuring an opportunity for all 1,000 Texas workers here in Johnson County.  And I want to thank you.  So we have 1,000 more workers that we can add onto the list.  (Applause.)  Louis Vuitton, thank you.  (Applause.)\nAnd it’s truly fitting that the name of this facility is Rochambeau Ranch, named for the French general who helped General George Washington win the decisive battle of the American Revolution and secure American independence.  That’s great.\nToday, France remains not only our oldest ally, but one of our most trusted and cherished.  We have a great relationship with France.  We have our little disputes with Emmanuel every once in a while.  Say hello to Emmanuel.  (Laughter.)  But we’re doing very well, and France is a great country and a wonderful group of people.  We have a lot of fun.  And I do — I like — I like your President very much, actually.\nToday, with the help of a great French partner, we are achieving a true victory for the people of Texas and the United States.\nOnce again, I want to express my deep appreciation to everyone at Louis Vuitton and to all of our incredible, devoted, skilled, and beloved American workers.\nAnd it’s now my honor to cut the ribbon and officially welcome Louis Vuitton to the great state of Texas.\nThank you, Bernard.  Thank you.  Thank you, everybody.  (Applause.)\n(The ribbon is cut.)  (Applause).\nEND\n5:32 P.M.

        "text": "U.S. Ambassador’s ResidenceAnkara, Turkey\n8:36 P.M. TRT\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  One week ago, Turkish forces crossed into Syria.  Earlier this week, President Trump took decisive action to call on Turkish forces to stand down, to end the violence, to agree to negotiations.  And today, I’m proud to report, thanks to the strong leadership of President Donald Trump and the strong relationship between President Erdoğan and Turkey and the United States of America, that today, the United States and Turkey have agreed to a ceasefire in Syria.\nThe Turkish side will pause Operation Peace Spring in order to allow for the withdrawal of YPG forces from the safe zone for 120 hours.  All military operations under Operation Peace Spring will be paused, and Operation Peace Spring will be halted entirely on completion of the withdrawal.\nOur administration has already been in contact with Syrian Defence Forces, and we have already begun to facilitate their safe withdrawal from the nearly 20-mile-wide safe zone area, south of the Turkish border in Syria.\nLet me say this also includes an agreement by Turkey to engage in no military action against the community of Kobani.\nAnd in addition, the United States and Turkey have both mutually committed to a peaceful resolution and future for the safe zone, working on an international basis to ensure that peace and security defines this border region of Syria.\nIn addition to the settlement today with the ceasefire, Turkey and the United States mutually committed to the Defeat ISIS activities in northeast Syria.  This will also include an agreement renewed today to coordinate efforts on detention facilities and internally displaced persons in formerly ISIS- controlled areas.\nAlso, Turkey and the United States agree on the priority of respecting vulnerable human life, human rights, and particularly the protection of religious and ethnic communities in the region.\nI spoke to President Trump just a few moments ago, and I know the President is very grateful for President Erdoğan’s willingness to step forward and to enact the ceasefire, and to give an opportunity for a peaceful solution of this conflict that commenced one week ago.\nFor my part, I’m grateful for the President’s leadership.  I’m grateful for the more than five hours of negotiations with President Erdoğan and his team that arrived at a solution that we believe will save lives.\nAnd let me also say I’m very grateful for this team.  To be able to have, alongside the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo; our National Security Advisor, Robert O’Brien; Ambassador Jim –Jim Jeffrey; and Ambassador David Satterfield was a great privilege.  And each of the members of this team contributed equally to achieving this outcome, which is a great contribution to security in this region, and it’s a great contribution to the strong and enduring relationship between the United States of America and Turkey.\nLastly, I want to express my appreciation to millions of Americans who I know were carrying this moment in prayer.  We heard from people all over the country whose hearts were heavy with the loss of life in this conflict over the last week — longed to see it brought to an end.  And I believe their prayers, the strong leadership that President Trump provided to this moment, and the cooperation with President Erdoğan and Turkey has made this possible.\nAnd so again, let me say: A week after Turkish forces crossed into Syria, Turkey and the United States of America have agreed to a ceasefire in Syria.  It will be a pause in military operations for 120 hours, while the United States facilitates the withdrawal of YPG from the affected areas in the safe zone.  And once that is completed, Turkey has agreed to a permanent ceasefire.  And the United States of America will work with Turkey, will work with nations around the world, to ensure that peace and stability is the order of the day in this safe zone on the border between Syria and Turkey.\nWith that, let me recognize Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  And thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your great work.\nSECRETARY POMPEO:  Thanks.  I think the Vice President said it well.  I just wanted to add to this thought: There obviously remains a great deal of work to do in the region.  There’s lots of challenges that remain.  But this effort tonight sets the conditions for the successful resolution of this particular piece, which created enormous risk and a real risk of instability.  And President Erdoğan’s decision tonight to work alongside President Trump to achieve this end will be one that I think will benefit Turkey a great deal.  Thanks.\nI know you want to take some questions.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Humeyra.  Where are you?  Go right ahead.\nQ    Thank you very much.  What do you — how do you overcome — how will you overcome the damage that’s been caused over the past week?  There has been a lot of animosity between U.S. and Turkey.  A lot of things have been said and a lot of threats of economic sanctions have been made.  How are you going to repair the relationship going forward?  Thank you.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, first, as you’ll see from the agreement, part of our understanding is that, with the implementation of the ceasefire, the United States will not impose any further sanctions on Turkey.  And once a permanent ceasefire is in effect, the President has agreed to withdraw the economic sanctions that were imposed this last Monday.\nBut make no mistake about it: President Trump was very clear with our ally, Turkey, about American opposition to Turkish military forces entering Syria.  The President made that clear in his discussions, in his correspondence with President Erdoğan.  And I believe that the candor and frankness that President Trump applied to this and the strength of his relationship with President Erdoğan both contributed to the ability for this agreement to come about.\nAnd now, we will — we will work together to implement this agreement.  As I said, our team is already working with YPG personnel in the safe zone for an orderly withdrawal outside the 20-mile mark.  And we’re going to go forward together to bring peace and security this region.  I’m very confident of that.\nOkay, I — Gonca Senay.  Gonca.  Please.\nQ    Thank you.  Gonca Senay from TRT World.  There are reports by some international organizations on how YPG is treating ethnic and religious minorities in northern Syria, and Christian leaders in Turkey are making calls to the country to ensure peace and security in the region.  I’m wondering your thoughts on this.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, let me — let the Secretary also address that.  But I can tell you that President Erdoğan and I spoke at great length about the importance of protecting religious minorities in the region.\nPresident Erdoğan also shared with me the perspective of many leaders in religious communities here in Turkey, who had great concerns about violence and persecution taking place along the border.\nAnd so, part of our agreement is to continue to work very closely to ensure that religious minorities can thrive and that religious pluralism is — is one of the characteristics of this — of this safe zone for some time to come.  Mr. Secretary?\nSECRETARY POMPEO:  I’d add only this: We’ve certainly heard from — the Vice President heard from Christian leaders around the world who expressed much of the same concern that you just described.\nWe think this reduction in violence, this ceasefire, reduces the risk of that.  So we think this greatly contributes to protecting religious minorities throughout — throughout Syria and throughout the broader Middle East as well.  This all obviously happens in the context of lots of religious challenges, lots of challenges of religious persecution in Iraq and other places as well.  We think this is an important contribution in that regard.\nThe other thing is — that we talked about at some length — is that, to the extent there are abuses that are identified, we’ll ask each leader — certainly President Erdoğan and his team and others — to investigate any allegations of abuse that have taken place.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  And let me maybe add an addendum to that.  One of the things I know the President and the American people are most proud of is the investment of hundreds of millions of dollars to help rebuild Christian, Yazidi, and other religious minority communities in the aftermath of the horrifying violence during the — during the ISIS period, both in Syria and in northern Iraq.\nWe’ll continue to flow those resources to support those communities. But as you’ll see from this agreement, it is a specific undertaking by Turkey and by the United States to ensure — to protect religious minorities in the affected region.\nShaun Tandon.\nQ    Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  You mentioned that there’s an organized withdrawal of the YPG fighters.  Could you explain that a little bit more?  You said there’s been an agreement with them.  Where are they going to withdraw to?  What do you see of the future of them?\nAnd while there are obviously concerns here in Turkey about the YPG and their links to PKK, many in Washington say, for example, that they lead part of the fight against the Islamic State group, against ISIS.  What do you see for the future of northern Syria?  Do you see any future for the Syrian Kurds, politically, there?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, our commitment with Turkey is that we will work with YPG members and — we also know as Syria Defense Forces — to facilitate an orderly withdrawal over the next 120 hours.  Let me say that’s literally already begun.  And where they will be withdrawing from is the demarcation line, roughly 20 miles south of the border.\nTurkey’s willingness to pause and to embrace a ceasefire of military operations, to enable us to — to see to that orderly withdrawal of YPG will, we believe, make it possible for that to occur.  And it — I know it’s already — already underway, as we speak.\nBut, look, Turkey has had a great concern about their border.  And while the United States of America did not approve of their military crossing into Syria, we have always endorsed a safe zone.  And it was a matter of discussion and negotiations.\nAnd we believe that — that the Kurdish population in Syria, with which we have a strong relationship, will continue to endure.  The United States will always be grateful for our partnership with SDF in defeating ISIS, but we recognize the importance and the value of a safe zone to create a buffer between Syria proper and the Kurdish population and — and the Turkish border.  And we’re going to be working very closely.\nSo we — we think the agreement today first ends the violence, which is what President Trump sent us here to do.  I said it again and again to President Erdoğan — is President Trump sent us here to end the violence and to achieve an immediate ceasefire.  And thanks to the agreement that we negotiated today and the strong stand that President Trump took in the preceding days, we — we’ve achieved that.\nWe’ve also achieved an opportunity, by working with YPG, to move out of the area to create more peace and security and stability in that buffer zone.  And we’re going to be working very earnestly to accomplish that.  We believe that can be accomplished during the 120-hour period, and after which, there’ll be a permanent ceasefire, and then we’ll continue to engage.\nAgain, not militarily.  The President made it clear that we’re not going to have military personnel on the ground.  But the United States will continue to engage diplomatically, politically, and, of course, in humanitarian aid and support to affect all of the people affected in this region.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead there, Zeke.\nQ    Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  You mentioned that — excuse me.  You mentioned that the United States opposed to Turkey’s incursion into northern Syria — that Erdoğan had always wanted a sort of safe zone here.  What concessions did you actually get out of President Erdoğan, number one?\nNumber two: Have you gotten specific assurances from the YPG that they will comply with the terms of this agreement? Because this is something that they have said that they would not do.\nAnd finally, with the Kurds moving south and now with sort of — with the U.S. sanction, in terms of them moving south, what — how would you address critics who would call this potentially a second abandonment of the Kurds?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think you’ll be able to see from the agreement itself what concessions were made.  President Trump, in his telephone call with President Erdoğan earlier this week and in the directive that he gave us to deliver, was very clear that he — he wanted a ceasefire.  He wanted to stop the violence.\nTurkey is engaged in an active military operation.  I can tell you that, as our discussions began, over the course of the five-hour period of time, we — we reached a place of agreement about how a ceasefire could benefit Turkey, achieve President Trump’s objectives, and also contribute to a peaceful resolution of the safe zone.  And I believe that — I believe that we’ve accomplished that.\nWith regard to the YPG, the Syrian Defence Forces, we have been in contact today and we have received repeated assurances from them that they’ll be moving out, that they greatly welcome the opportunity for a ceasefire to make a safe and orderly withdrawal from those areas in the safe zone where they still have a presence.  And we’re very confident that that’s already taking place.\nAnd we’re going to be using all the leverage that we have, of having fought alongside the Syrian Defense Forces in the battle against ISIS to facilitate their safe withdrawal. But we think we — we think this is an outcome that will greatly serve the interests of — of the Kurdish population in Syria, it’ll greatly serve the interests of Turkey, and it’ll create the kind of long-term buffer zone that will ensure peace and stability in the region.\nQ    Mr. Vice President —\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Go right ahead.\nQ    I just want to follow up on that question.  What specific concessions did Turkey receive?  Specifically, I want to ask you if they brought the issue of the bank — Halbank — Halkbank, rather.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Not in the context of these negotiations.  I think when we had concluded the negotiations, I know the topic was raised.  And we informed them that that was a matter for the Southern District of New York and the Justice Department.\nBut let me say the — the concessions that the United States made have to do with the fact that the President had made it clear that if there had not been a ceasefire today, there would have been a new round of massive sanctions against Turkey.  And you’ll see in the agreement that — on the basis of the pause of 120 hours; a ceasefire over the next five days — that we will not be implementing additional sanctions during that period of time.\nOnce we have a permanent ceasefire, following the orderly withdrawal of all YPG forces, the United States also agreed to withdraw the sanctions that were imposed on several Cabinet officials and several agencies earlier this week.\nQ    To be clear though, just to nail this down: So, it was simply the sanctions that would be removed?  Nothing else was offered or given to the Turks?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  Right.\nSECRETARY POMPEO:  That’s correct.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  That’s —\nYeah.  Go ahead.\nQ    Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  While you were here negotiating with the Turks for several hours, both of you —\nQ    (Cross-talk.)\nQ    Can I finish real quick?  Wait.\nQ    Do you think the YPG — do you think the sanctions is a blackmail against your NATO Ally for the sake of PKK, YPG terrorist organizations?  This is a (inaudible).\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  The United States of America did not support Turkey’s military action in Syria.  President Trump made that very clear to his friend, President Erdoğan.  And the United States imposed sanctions earlier this week.  And the President made it clear yesterday, and we made it clear again today, that there would be additional sanctions coming to bring an end to the violence, to the loss of innocent lives in this border conflict.\nThat being said, let me say: I really believe today — today’s ceasefire is a credit to President Trump and to President Erdoğan.  It’s a credit to the strong relationship between the United States and Turkey.  It’s also a credit to the strong relationship between our two leaders.\nI mean, where there are differences between friends, it’s important that the friends let their feelings be known. President Trump did that, in this case.  But it facilitated us being able to reach an agreement that has now resulted in a ceasefire and, we believe, will set the stage for creating a peaceful and stable safe zone in the United States.  He’s committed to achieving that for all the people of this region.\nThank you all.\nEND\n8:58 P.M.

EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, thank you very much, everyone.  It’s an honor to have you all at the White House.  You hear that beautiful music in the background?  Normally, we wait until it ends, but you’re Italian; we move fast, right?  (Laughter.)  You definitely move fast.\nTonight, we celebrate the extraordinary friendship between Italy and the United States.  And we honor the faith, courage, and countless achievements of our incredible Italian-American community.  Those people in that community have done so much for our country.\nWe are grateful to be joined by a very special man — a highly respected man in Italy and far beyond — President Sergio Mattarella of Italy.  (Applause.)  And his beautiful daughter, Laura.  Laura, would you like to come up?  Please, come up.  Please.  Come on up, Laura.  Thank you.  Great.\nAnd thank you both for coming today to reaffirm the powerful bonds between our people.\nI want to thank the many amazing members of my Cabinet, hardworking members of Congress, members of both Italian and American diplomatic missions, and many other distinguished guests with us tonight.  We have so many.  Senator John Barrasso is here someplace.  John?\nWe have Senator Joe Manchin.

But if you win by as many votes as you did that’s a great testament to you.  Eugene Scalia, thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Great.  Congratulations.\nSecretary Elaine Chao, one of my favorite people.  Where is Elaine?  Hi, Elaine.  (Applause.)  Beautiful woman and a great woman.\nAnd Secretary Wilbur Ross.  (Applause.)  Why, Wilbur — and I owe you a call, Wilbur.\nBut I want to thank you all for being here very much.  And our nation and our civilization have been profoundly enriched by Italian faith, courage, creativity, brilliance, and spirit.\nThe timeless legacy of the Roman Republic — what two beautiful words, “Roman Republic” — influenced nations around the globe to pursue the ideals of citizenship, representative government, and the rule of law.  Sounds so familiar, doesn’t it?\nThe Italian Renaissance opened new horizons of human endeavor and uplifted the world with immortal works of genius.  And when I go to Italy and I look and I see, and I see the greatest artists in history.  Michelangelo carved life into marble, and da Vinci inspired wonder with feats of divine beauty.  You just don’t see it anywhere else, to that extent.\nThrough the centuries, Italy gave us everything from Galileo’s telescope, to Verdi’s opera, to Versace’s fashion, to the voice of my friend — he was a great friend of mine — Pavarotti.  He was a diva.  He was the greatest of all divas.  He was a male — he was a male diva, but we loved him.   And the young man that just sang, it reminded me so much — his voice reminded me so much of Luciano.  And the cars of Lamborghini and Ferrari.  Think of what you’ve done.  Think of it — how brilliant it is, artistically.\nFrom the hallowed dome of Saint Peter’s, to the beautiful frescos of our own Capitol Building, the Italian heritage has wonderfully shaped all of our country.  Indeed, our name, “America,” is derived from the great Italian navigator and mapmaker, Amerigo Vespucci.  That’s right.  (Applause.)\nOn Monday, our nation commemorated the legendary achievements of an intrepid Italian explorer: Christopher Columbus.  (Applause.)  And today, from Columbus Circle — and you know all about Columbus Circle.  We love Columbus Circle in New York.  And Columbus, Ohio — what a great place that is.  (Applause.)  To our nation’s capital, the District of Columbia, his memory stands as an enduring testament to the daring spirit that built our great civilization.  And as long as I have anything to say about this — and I hope that’s going to be a long time — it will always be Columbus Day.  (Applause.)\nSince the earliest days of our republic, the United States has also been uplifted by the contributions, sacrifices, and accomplishments of a vibrant, thriving, and proud Italian-American community.  You come from a great, great community.  Great achievers.  Great people.\nItalian-Americans have invigorated every aspect of our society, culture, and history, from Frank Sinatra — a friend of mine; to Frank Capra; from Joe DiMaggio — he was a great player, great player; to Vince Lombardi — what a coach; and from Mother Cabrini, to the late, great Justice Antonin Scalia, the father of Gene.  (Applause.)  Soon he’ll be known as “the father of Gene.”  Right, Gene?  (Laughter.)  He was a great man and a great guy.\nCountless Italian-Americans have answered the call to defend our nation in uniform, serving in every war and every branch of our armed forces.\nAmong those we’re honored to have with us tonight, the first Marine to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a proud Italian American: General Peter Pace.  Peter?  Where are you, Peter?  Peter?  (Applause.)  Wow.  Great.  That’s fantastic.  The Chairman — that’s a big position, Peter, right?  That’s a great position.  We have a great new Chairman, now, as you know.  I want to thank you, Peter, for being here and heroism on the battlefield, your lifetime of service to our nation.  Thank you very much.\nThis evening, we’re also thrilled to be joined by another very special guest — an Italian-American legend who truly knows about winning and he knows about speed.  I had the privilege of being driven by him one day along — we were doing a show along Central Park West.  He took off in a car — four blocks.  We covered the blocks in about one second.  And I said, “Get me — get me out of here.”  (Laughter.)  And you’ll see what I’m talking about.  But it was a seriously fast and I’m very happy to be with you tonight.\nHis family immigrated to the United States in 1955 with just $125 dollars to their name.  As a boy, he dreamed to be like his heroes in Formula One racing.  And sure enough, he grew up to be one of the fastest men alive, one of the greatest racers of all time.  He is the only driver in world history to win the Indy 500, the Daytona 500, and the Formula One World Championship. Not bad.  I guess he likes speed.  He has 111 career wins in races all across the globe, which has to be a record of some kind.  That’s a lot of wins.  That’s a lot of non-choking.  There’s no choke when you win that much.  A lot of people choke.  He doesn’t choke.\nHe is a legendary racecar driver, and somebody that’s very special in the annals of sport, Mario Andretti.  (Applause.)  Mario, wherever you are, come on up.  Come up, Mario.  Come up, Mario.  There he is.  Boy, you look good, Mario.\nYou remember you took me on that ride?  I said, “Get me out of here.”  He said — we were together.  I said, “Mario, get me out of here.  I want to get out of this car.”  We went so fast.  We literally — we covered four blocks in like a second.  (Laughter.)  And he said, “Sir, that’s actually going very slow.”  He wanted to go faster.  I said, “We did it enough.”  That was for “The Apprentice.”  We had fun.\nSay a few words to your friends, please.  Thank you, Mario.\nMR. ANDRETTI:  I’m also not very tall, as you can see.  (Laughter.)  Well, thank you so much.  And as you said, I’m an Italian immigrant.  I’m very, very — as you can imagine — proud of my heritage.  But I also found we, as a family — we found our home here in America.  And I’m the true, true, I think, example of what the American Dream is about.\nAnd I always said, because of that, with pride and gratitude, I salute the Stars and Stripes.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  That’s great, Mario.\nMR. ANDRETTI:  Yes, indeed.  And, again, I can only thank you and thank you for having me up here.  And I know that you made the show, right?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  That’s right.\nMR. ANDRETTI:  And we made it so —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Absolutely.\nMR. ANDRETTI:  — so that was mission accomplished.  And I appreciate that fact.  So thank you very much, Mr. President.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Do you remember that day?\nMR. ANDRETTI:  Yeah, I remember.  Yes, I — actually it’s on YouTube.  I showed it to some of our friends back here.  (Laughter.)  Yeah.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I’m not sure I want to watch.\nMR. ANDRETTI:  I didn’t mess up your hair either.  (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, he didn’t.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Mario.\nMR. ANDRETTI:  Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  One hundred and eleven wins — think about that — for speed.  And that has to be in your blood, Mario, right?\nLet him say hello to the President.  (Laughter.)  I think they like each other.\nHey, Mario, so when you have 111 wins, that’s in your blood, right?  It’s got to be in the blood.  Can you do that if you don’t like going fast, huh?  Yeah, you get — you get a driver, that’s the way you do it, right?  (Laughter.)\nAnyway, thank you very much.  Stay up here if you’d like, Mario.  Thank you very much.\nTo all Italian-Americans in the room and across our country: Again, thank you for uplifting our communities, thank you for strengthening our nation, and thank you for everything you’ve done to unleash American greatness.  You’re an amazing group of people.  I know so many people in the room tonight.  We have so many successful people, great people.\nAs many of you know, our guest of honor tonight, President Sergio Mattarella, entered politics to combat the mafia — that means he’s tough; that’s a tough deal — and spent much of his career rooting out corruption.  He is a crime-fighter and a patriot — two things we love in America.  He’s also the first Sicilian President of the Italian Republic.  (Applause.)\nMr. President, we are delighted to have you both with us at the White House.  And I really have a lot of respect for you.  We spent the day together.  It was a wild day.  He said, “You know, your news conferences are tougher than most.”  (Laughter.)  It’s — every question is a kill.  They go in for the kill — the fake news back there.  Every question is a kill.  But he got it.  He’s a pro.  He’s really amazing.  He’s an amazing guy.\nAnd I’d like to invite you up, Mr. President, to say a few words.  Please.  (Applause.)\nPRESIDENT MATTARELLA:  (As interpreted.)  Mr. President, I am very grateful for your words of friendship — words that I wish to reciprocate.  Also, on behalf of my daughter and of my accompanying delegation, thank you also very much for your very, very warm welcome here in Washington, D.C.\nAnd I also listened with a great deal of pleasure to the words you have spoke a few minutes ago, mentioning all of the bonds we share and all the great people that are of Italian heritage.\nAnd I am happy to be able to greet representatives of the U.S. institutions and civil society, along with representatives of the American community of Italian descent, all of whom are citizens who, through their labor, their dignity, and their sacrifice, have contributed to the progress of this great nation and to its identity, thereby honoring the motto, “E Pluribus Unum,” which has been accompanying the country for over two centuries.\nMore and more people, including many youngsters, now consider the United States and Italy as a home which they can live in and move back and forth in, and therefore supporting our countries with passion and determination as they head towards the future.\nAnd by doing so, our deep friendship is strengthened.  It is a friendship fostered by the Trans-Atlantic Alliance, and it was fostered very much after World War Two.  The United States contribution to the liberation of Europe from Nazi fascism is priceless, and Italy and Europe’s gratitude towards your American people is everlasting.  We are part of a community of values and principles.\nThe United States of America’s responsible leadership in the free world, also thanks to the impulse it gave to the creation of the United Nations, has had Italy’s full support in striving towards peace and international security, as recently happened in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Balkans, the Horn of Africa, and the Sahel, within the framework of the Coalition to Defeat Daesh and Transnational Terrorism.  And, together, as loyal allies, Washington and Rome have faced the challenges of an ever-changing global context.\nMr. President, peace and development in Europe have been guaranteed by the integration of countries which used to be opponents.  The United States were a key player in calling for intense cooperation between European countries after World War Two, and we still acknowledge the importance of that choice in striking a global balance in which freedom and the rights of mankind are respected.\nTo us, the European Union — besides being a driver for growth and prosperity, much like the Atlantic Alliance, is a community we were destined for — one founded on the values and rights we share with the United States.\nTo our countries, Mr. President, the Trans-Atlantic bond resonates in our common foreign and defense policies, and in our close social relations, our cultural cooperation, our traditional economic cooperation, and trade — which we hope will develop with the broadest and fairest freedom of trade and growth and investments.\nOur bond embraces research and involves scholars, universities, businesses, and professionals from both our countries.  It’s something we’re witnessing in the fascinating quest to increase our knowledge regarding space — a journey which was started when the U.S., and mankind with it, allowed the first human being to step onto the moon’s soil.\nAnd I wish to celebrate that feat by sending my thoughts to the astronauts, including Nick Hague, Andrew Morgan, Christina Koch, and our own Luca Parmitano, who are currently working on the International Space Station.  (Applause.)\nMr. President, these women and men orbiting the Earth speak to us of hope, and they speak to us of the future of mankind.  They represent the progress shared by the U.S., Europe, and Italy.  Thank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\nThank you very much.  And, Mrs. Scalia, thank you very much.  A special woman.  I just spotted you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nEND\n7:19 P.M.

EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, thank you very much.  It’s a great honor to have the President of Italy with us.  He is a man of great distinction.  He’s highly respected in this country.  And it’s nice to have you at the White House.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\nWe’ve had a great relationship with Italy for a long time.  I don’t think it’s ever been closer than it is now.  We have won a $7.5 billion award from, as you know — I guess it’s been pretty big news.  And I know that this is against the European Union and World Trade — good ole World Trade.  For a long time, they’ve been taking advantage of the United States.  And I know Turkey is going to talk to us about their share of it because they feel they shouldn’t have to pay so much.\nAnd if you look at what’s going on, Italy is complaining about it.  Turkey is com- — everybody is complaining about it.  Turkey is complaining about a lot of things, and we’re handling Turkey very nicely.  But we have many countries complaining about the different awards that we’ve been winning lately from the courts.  And the reason we’re winning is we’re properly represented.\nWe’re winning, in the case of the European Union, $7.5 billion.  And Italy has a percentage of that to pay.  And, in the — in other cases, we’ve won.  And we have a lot of money coming into the United States for the first time ever.  Tremendous amounts of money in many different forms, including tariffs.\nOur farmers now have been taken care of well.  China has already started their purchases.  There was some misreporting, which does not — frankly, I’m not at all surprised — but there’s been some misreporting that China will start purchasing when the deal is signed.\nThe deal is being papered right now.  Bob Lighthizer is with us.  Mike Pompeo is with us.  And they’re going to be joining us for the discussion.\nBut there have been some reports that China is not buying until the deal is signed.  No, China has started buying already from the farmers.  It’ll be anywhere from $40 [billion] to $50 billion, which is far more than anybody thought or expected.  It’s a great deal for the farmers.  I think the farmers will come out — along with many other industries in the United States — will come out as one of the big beneficiaries of the trade deal with China.\nBut they have already started purchasing; in fact, they started purchasing three weeks ago.  You can see the numbers for yourself.  It’s great for our country.  It’s great for — I think it’s great for China, too.  But it’s something that’s already taken effect, even though the deal won’t be signed probably until I meet with President Xi in Chile, where we have a summit.  So that’ll be good.\nBut the World Trade — as you know, we won $7.5 billion, and that is being distributed among various countries in the European Union.  Italy is one of those countries.  And I know that the President of Italy wants to discuss that, and it’s one of the discussions.\nAnd the other thing, of course, is trade and numerous elements of the military, and terrorism, and security.  So, we’ll be discussing everything.\nPlease.\n(Interpreter provides translation.)\nAnd I’m pleased to report that in Syria, Turkey — the border — we only had 28 soldiers, not 50.  We thought it was 50.  Somebody reported 50.  It was actually down to 28.  They were removed a while ago.  All American soldiers are away from the site.\nSyria and Turkey may fight.  Syria is friendly with the Kurds.  The Kurds are very well protected; plus, they know how to fight.  And, by the way, they’re no angels, but they were with us.  They are no angels.  But they are fighting.  We are largely out of that area.  We’re very well set.  We have quite a contingent, right nearby, of soldiers and of the finest equipment in the world.  I don’t think we’ll have to use it.\nSo, Syria is either negotiating with or talking to Turkey.  We’re also talking to Turkey.  We’ve put massive sanctions on Turkey.  Sanctions work, frankly, better than fighting.  Certainly when you’re down to 28 people, we’re not going to be fighting.  We didn’t want to fight anyway.  I don’t think there’s any reason to, from the United States’ standpoint.\nNow, as to Syria wanting to take back their land, that’s a whole different story.  If Syria wants to fight for their land, that’s up to Turkey and Syria, as it has been for hundreds of years, they’ve been fighting.  And the Kurds have been fighting for hundreds of years — that whole mess.  It’s been going along for a long time.\nSyria may have some help with Russia, and that’s fine.  It’s a lot of sand.  They’ve got a lot of sand over there.  So there’s a lot of sand that they can play with.\nBut we were supposed to be there for 30 days; we stayed for 10 years.  And it’s time for us to come home.  We’re not a policing agent, and it’s time for us to come home.\nBut we’re working with Turkey.  We’re working with talking to everybody in the area — whatever we can to do keep it stable or stabilize it as much as possible, knowing that it’s possibly never going to be very stable.\nAnd we are — I think we’re in a very good position in the Middle East.  I think we’re very, very strong in the Middle East.  Iran is going to hell; their economy is in deep trouble.  Their GDP went down 20 percent, which nobody ever even heard of before.  Probably 25 percent.\nWe’ll be talking to Iran also.  They want very much to talk.  The sanctions with Iran — all of the things that we’ve done, including some tariffs and different things having to do with countries that are dealing with them that we put on — all of the economic sanctions are working very well.\nSo, Iran will be an interesting case, but we’ll see.  They want to talk.  We’ll see whether or not they talk.  If they talk, good.  And if they don’t talk, that’s okay, too.  But I think we’re doing a very good job in the sense of, strategically, we have Syria talking about their land.  It’s not our land.  Turkey has gone on to Syria.  And, if Turkey goes into Syria, that’s between Turkey and Syria; it’s not between Turkey and the United States, like a lot of stupid people would like us to — would like you to believe.\nAnd I watched, last night — a couple of people understood.  Actually, a couple of the Democrats — I won’t say which ones — but a couple of the more competent Democrats actually understood what I was doing and what the plan is.\nBut, really, the plan is to get out of endless wars, to bring our soldiers back home, to not be policing agents all over the world.  If you look at other countries — Russia, China — they don’t have countries to take care of.  We have — we’re close to 90 countries, in one form or another.  We’re in 90 countries all over the world, policing and — frankly, many of those countries, they don’t respect what we’re doing, they don’t even like what we’re doing, and they don’t like us.\nSo, we’re looking all over the world.  There’s tremendous amounts of money, manpower, lives that we save by doing it much differently.  If people aren’t respecting what we’re going to be doing, that’s too bad.\nYou read where we’re sending some troops to Saudi Arabia.  That’s true.  Because we want to help Saudi Arabia.  They have been a very good ally.  They’ve agreed to pay for the cost of those troops.  They’ve agreed to pay fully for the cost of everything we’re doing over there.  That’s something you have never heard before, I think, as long as you’ve been standing out there.  I think you — the media has never heard that before.\nBut Saudi Arabia has graciously agreed to pay for the full cost of everything we’re doing for them.  We’re sending some tremendous missiles over.  We’re sending some great power over to Saudi Arabia.  Saudi Arabia is paying for 100 percent of the cost, including the cost of our soldiers.  And that negotiation took a very short time — like, maybe, about 35 seconds.\nAnd I would like now to introduce the President of Italy to say a few words.  And I’m sure you’re going to have many questions for him.\nThank you.\nPRESIDENT MATTARELLA:  (As interpreted.)  Well, Mr. President, thank you very much for your kind invitation and for a very warm welcome to the White House.  Thank you for the very interesting remarks you just made.  I’m sure we will be discussing all of these issues during our talks later on in a full spirit of loyalty and cooperation, which is what friends and allies have to do.\nItaly and the U.S. share a set of values, a set of cultures.  Our bond is fostered by our human relations.  And I’m very pleased to be here in this moment in time as we celebrate the Italian-American Heritage Month.\nAnd again, I’m very happy to be here to meet with you, Mr. President.  It’s a pleasure to see you again after we met at the G20 Summit in Taormina, Sicily.  Our meeting, again, is proof of the friendship between our countries, as also testified by our common belonging to the Atlantic Alliance and, of course, by the human bonds that our countries share and by the long friendship and alliance that we have.\nAnd as you may remember, Mr. President, when we met in the summit in Taormina, the weather was wonderful.  It was also beautiful here yesterday, as well.  And, of course, the fact that we can meet in different places around the world testifies to how solid our bonds are.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think the bonds between Italy and the United States have never been more solid.  I have so many Italian friends.  I can’t tell you how many Italian friends.  And we have a lot also in your government.  We have a lot of great friends in your government.\nI think the WTO award has been testament to a lot of good work by the Trump administration.  We never won with the WTO, or essentially never won.  Very seldom did we win.  And now we’re winning a lot.  We’re winning a lot because they know if we’re not treated fairly, we’re leaving.  Because we were a piggybank that every other country was robbing.  And China became rich because of the WTO.  That’s when China really ascended.  That’s when China went up.  That’s when they made their great rise.  They were flat lining, and then, all of a sudden, around the year 2000, 2001, when they got involved with the WTO, it became a whole different story.\nAnd China was taking $500 billion a year out of the United States, plus intellectual property theft and many other things.  And it was — I give China a lot of credit.  I give the people that ran our country no credit.  I give them discredit for what they allowed to happen.\nBut the WTO — that’s the World Trade Organization — has been very unfair to the United States.  They know I feel that way, and I think since they know I feel that way, all of a sudden, we’re starting to win very big awards.\nThe $7.5 billion that we won is going to be discussed.  The percentage — a percentage of that is to be paid by Italy.  And Italy thinks that we’re charging them too much, and we will certainly take that under consideration.  And we will discuss that today.\nWe’re also discussing some very big trade deals.  Actually, Italy is a very major trade partner with us.  We do a lot of trade together.  And they make incredible product.  We buy and they buy.  And we have a very good relationship — sometimes stymied by the European Union, which is, frankly, very tough to deal with and very tough negotiators, very unfair negotiators.  They know I feel that way.  And we’ll see what happens, ultimately, with the European Union.  But they have been very unfair to the United States.  Italy, on the other hand, they’ve been a great partner.\nPlease.\n(Interpreter provides translation.)\nQ    Are you okay — are you okay with Erdoğan saying that he is not going to do a ceasefire?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  He didn’t say that at all.  He’s meeting.  And he’s meeting today with some of our representatives.  Mike Pence is leaving today, as you know.  We needed to take an extra day for security reasons.  But Mike is leaving.  Mike Pompeo will be meeting also, who is here right now with us.  And he is going to be joining the meeting.  We have a lot of great people over there.  We’ll see.\nIn the meantime, our soldiers are not in harm’s way — as they shouldn’t be — as two countries fight over land that has nothing to do with us.\nAnd the Kurds are much safer right now, but the Kurds know how to fight.  And, as I said, they’re not angels.  They’re not angels, if you take a look.  You have to go back and take a look.  But they fought with us.  We paid a lot of money for them to fight with us, and that’s okay.  They did well when they fought with us; they didn’t do so well when they didn’t fight with us.\nWhen I refused to allow the Americans, a year and a half ago, to fight with the Kurds against Iraq, I said, “Wait a minute, this country, stupidly, just spent a fortune on fighting for, with, around Iraq.”  Nobody knows how they spent it.  But they spent — actually, we’re in the Middle East now for $8 trillion, if you can believe that stupidity.  But, in Iraq, we’re in for probably $5.5 trillion.  So they’re telling me, “Wait a minute, we just spent $5.5 trillion fighting in Iraq and with Iraq.  And now we’re supposed to spend money to fight with the Kurds against Iraq.”  I said, “No, thank you.”\nSo what happens is, when I said we’re not going to fight with the Kurds, the Kurds left.  They didn’t want to fight against Iraq, which right now isn’t the greatest fighting force in the world.  That happened twice.  The Kurds, actually, are pulling back substantially from Turkey.  And Syria is pulling in.  Syria probably will have a partner of Russia — whoever they may have.  I wish them all a lot of luck.  You know, Russia was involved in Afghanistan.  Used to be called the Soviet Union.  Now it’s called Russia for a reason, because they lost so much money in Afghanistan, that they had to downsize.  A very big downsizing.\nSo, if Russia wants to get involved with the — with Syria, that’s really up to them.  They have a problem with Turkey, they have a problem at a border.  It’s not our border.  We shouldn’t be losing lives over it.\nBut again, we only had 28 soldiers.  It was 26, 28.  I got all different numbers.  It ends up being 28 — between the 26, 28.  Two people, and they’re fully accounted for.\nSo, that’s the story.  It’s very simple.  And we’re watching and we’re negotiating, and we’re trying to get Turkey to do the right thing, because we’d like to stop wars regardless.  Whether Americans are in or whether they’re not in, we want to see wars stopped.  That’s a very important thing.  On a humanitarian basis, we want to see that happen.\nSteve?\nQ    How confident are you that Mike Pence will be able to arrange a ceasefire?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Why don’t you go and dictate?\nINTERPRETER:  Yes.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes, please.\nINTERPRETER:  The answer was —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I’ll let you go.\nINTERPRETER:  — “No, not at all.”  Excuse me. (Laughs.)\nPRESIDENT MATTARELLA:  (Speaks Italian.)\nINTERPRETER:  (Continues translation in Italian.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  So I view the situation on the Turkish border with Syria to be, for the United States, strategically brilliant.  Our soldiers are out of there.  Our soldiers are totally safe.  They’ve got to work it out.  Maybe they can do it without fighting.  Syria is protecting the Kurds.  That’s good.\nWe are — and, by the way, every player hates ISIS.  Everybody we’re talking about.  Syria more than us.  Russia more than us.  They’ve done a big number on Russia.  And we’re over there fighting ISIS, but they’re over there fighting ISIS, too.  They can handle it, and they should handle it.  We can fight our own battles on our own territories.\nBut you have a lot of countries over there that hate ISIS as much as we do; in some cases, probably more.  So they can take care of ISIS.  We have them captured.  The United States captured them.  Some were released just for effect — to make us look a little bit like, “Oh, gee, we’ve got to get right back in there.”  But you have a lot of countries over there that have power and that hate ISIS very much, as much as we do.\nSo I think we’re in a very strategically good position.  I know the fake news doesn’t make it look that way, but we have — we’ve removed all of our, as we said, 50 soldiers, but much less than 50 soldiers.  They’re now in a very — very safe location, heading into an even safer location.\nAnd we will help negotiate.  We have tremendously powerful sanctions.  Our country has become economically much more powerful than, frankly, it ever was.  We’ve picked up trillions and trillions of dollars in worth.  The market was up big yesterday.  It’s going to be up big today, it looks like.  The trade deal with China, just having to do with what we’ve done with the financial services, with banks, with the farmers, has been incredible — far greater than anyone ever thought.\nI agree, it hasn’t been papered yet, but it’s being papered.  But, in the meantime, as you know and as we’ve said many times, China has already started buying.  They want to buy.  They want to make a deal.  They really have to make a deal.  Their economy has been hurt very badly by what we’ve done and by the tariffs that we’ve charged.\nAnd we’ve taken in tremendous amounts of tariffs.  A small portion of them we’ve given to the farmer, which — the farmers — which has more than made up for what they’ve lost.\nGo ahead.\n(Interpreter provides translation.)\nAnd because of the newfound economic power of the United States, because of the fact that we’ve made so many trillions — many, many trillions of dollars in worth of the United States — I call it the “newfound economic power” — if my opponent would’ve won, China would right now be the most powerful nation, economically, in the world.  And, right now, they’re not even close.  And if we’re smart, they never will get close.  But it depends on who sits in this chair.\nBut the United States has tremendous economic power.  Far more power than playing around with having a few soldiers shooting each other at the border.  I mean, you have a few soldiers back and forth, killing each other at the border.  The power we have with sanctions and tariffs is far greater than what we’re talking about.\nWith that being said, our military has been completely rebuilt.  Much of the equipment has already been delivered.  We spent two and a half trillion dollars rebuilding it over the last three years.  And our military power is at the highest level, and our economic power is at the highest level.  But I’d always rather use economic power before I use military power, because people aren’t getting killed with economic power.  Okay?\nQ    Mr. President, you’re scheduled to see House Speaker Nancy Pelosi today.  How do you expect that meeting to go?\nPRESIDENT MATTARELLA:  (As interpreted.)  Before the members of the press introduce topics that have already been discussed this morning, President Trump was talking about the possible implementation of tariffs on European products following the whole Airbus affair.  Of course, that’s a topic that we will certainly be discussing this morning, and I do hope that we can come up with a cooperative-based approach and a frank discussion, so we can avoid retaliation between the two parties.\nItaly and I — myself, personally — have always felt that it’s better to talk things through to find a common solution, to find some sort of understanding for one another’s stances.  Because the alternative to that would be tariffs followed by retaliation, followed by further tariffs.  And we also have to understand that we are waiting for a solution of the Boeing affair, as well.\nSo, of course, within the spirit of the Atlantic Alliance, within the spirit of the friendship we’ve always had, I do feel it would be best to discuss these things and understand one another.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, in theory, there can’t be retaliation because this was an award that we got because of the fact that the European Union took advantage of past Presidents, and this was an award that we got for the unfair treatment given to the United States by the European Union.  So there should be no retaliation.\nThis was getting us even because $7.5 billion worth of things happened — bad things happened, unfair things happened — to the United States by the European Union.  So this was just getting us back to even.  And nobody else but me would’ve gotten that $7.5 billion back for the taxpayers of the United States.\nQ    Mr. President, I’m sure you saw reports that John Bolton said that Rudy Giuliani was like a “hand grenade” the way he was acting.  And are you concerned that Bolton could be called to testify in your impeachment inquiry?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Look, John Bolton — I got along well with him.  Some people didn’t; some people didn’t like John Bolton.  I actually got along with him pretty well.  It just didn’t work out.  I don’t know that he got along with Rudy Giuliani.\nRudy Giuliani was seeking out corruption, and what happens mostly in the 2016 election, because there was tremendous corruption in the 2016 election.  I think even you would admit that.  The election was — it was disgraceful what happened, and what happened to me, and what happened to the Republicans.  And that continues with Nancy Pelosi and with Schiff.  Adam Schiff got caught making up statements that he said I said, that I didn’t say — which is fraud.  I mean, it’s purely fraudulent.  So it continues.\nSo, Rudy was a great prosecutor.  He was the best mayor in the history of the city of New York, as far as I can see.  I think he’s pretty much acknowledged — what he did for crime and everything else.  And when he saw what was going on with our election of 2016 — the election I won, but the election that was absolutely corrupted by things that took place in government.  Now, we’ll see what happens.  The IG report is going to come out soon, and we’ll see what happens.\nI think people — I know nothing about it, in terms of the report.  I’m waiting for the report like everybody else.  But I predict you will see things that you don’t even believe, the level of corruption — whether it’s Comey; whether it’s Strzok and his lover, Page; whether it’s so many other people — McCabe; whether it’s President Obama himself.  Let’s see whether or not it’s President Obama.  Let’s see whether or not they put that in.\nQ    (Inaudible.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Wait a minute.  Let’s see whether or not.\nSo, Rudy saw that.  And I can tell you, Rudy Giuliani — because was very, very incensed at the horrible things that he saw, as are many people, okay?  And many Republicans.  And the Republicans have been treated very unfairly by the Democrats.  I’ll say this: Paul Ryan would never issue a subpoena.  I don’t say right or wrong.  He wouldn’t do it.  He had too much respect for our country.  Nancy Pelosi hands them out like cookies.  Everybody — I don’t even know these people.  And for the most part, people like that are test- — I don’t even know who they are.  I never even heard of some of them, most of them.\nBut I have all these people testifying.  And then they leak out.  They don’t say the goods parts; they only say the bad parts.  We’re not allowed to representation.  We’re not allowed to lawyers.  We’re not allowed to have anything.  The Democrats are treating the Republicans very, very badly.  Fortunately, we have a lot of good, strong, smart Republicans.  But they never dealt, Jon, with the Democrats the way the Democrats deal.  And the Republicans won’t forget it because what they’re doing, what the Democrats are doing to this nation is a disgrace.\nWhat they have done — the disrespect that they’ve shown to the presidency — and it’ll happen to them.  Because if the Republicans have the House, which I think they will — because of impeachment, I think — because of this nonsense impeachment.  It’s based on a perfect phone conversation — an absolutely perfect phone conversation with the President of Ukraine.\nA friend of mine, who’s a top lawyer, read it.  He said, “This is perfect.  You didn’t say…”  Did you know this was going to happen?  I actually thought it was going to happen.  There were many people listening to that conversation, because when I speak to a leader — like, if I speak to the President of Italy, if I speak to anybody — I know that there are many intelligence people on the line.  I know that, I mean, with my understanding and knowledge.  I don’t know exactly who, but I assume there are many people.\nFortunately, they had transcribers, stenographers — people that do this for a living — on the line because we have an exact copy of the report, of the call.\nSo the call was put out immediately when I started hearing about the whistleblower.  Well, the whistleblower’s report was totally wrong.  The whistleblower didn’t know what he was talking about, or was given false information, or it was even worse than that.  Now, all of a sudden, Schiff doesn’t want to talk to the whistleblower.  Now, all of a sudden, quid pro quo doesn’t matter because now they see, in the call, there was no quid pro quo.\nSo, with Rudy, Rudy was seeking out corruption.  And I think there’s nothing wrong seeking out corruption.\nDid you have — Steve?\nQ    But should Rudy have registered as a foreign lobbyist, though?  That’s the question here.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I don’t know what he did.  I — I don’t know.  That’s up to him.\nQ    He had clients and he was talking to you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  That, you have to ask — excuse me, no.  You have to ask Rudy those questions.  Don’t ask me.  But Rudy was one of many people that was incensed at the corruption that took place during that election.  Pure corruption.\nFor instance, I still ask the FBI: Where is the server?  How come the FBI never got the server from the DNC?  Where is the server?  I want to see the server.  Let’s see what’s on the server.  So, the server, they say, is held by a company whose primary ownership individual is from Ukraine.  I’d like to see the server.  I think it’s very important for this country to see the server.  Nobody wants to see it.  The media never wants to see it.  But I’ll tell you, Republicans want to see it.\nSo, Republicans aren’t treated well.  And here’s the problem: I think we’re going to take the House, based on what’s happening with the impeachment stuff.  And the Republicans can do the same thing in reverse if they ever have — and I hope it’s going to be a long time, because nobody has done a better job with the economy, with our military, with — I’ve rebuilt the military.  Our economy is the best it’s ever been.  We have numbers that just came out where, not including taxes, the median household income for the average American has increased $5,000 in a very short time since I’ve been President.  Nobody has ever heard of numbers like that.\nSo, people want to find out: Why was it so corrupt during that election?  And I want to find out more than anybody else.\nSteve, go ahead.\nQ    One of the things that has been exposed by this Turkey situation is that as many as 50 nuclear weapons are at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey.  How confident are you of those weapons’ safety?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  We’re confident, and we have a great — a great air base there, a very powerful air base.  That air base alone can take any place.  It’s a large, powerful air base.\nAnd, you know, Turkey — just so people remember — Turkey is a NATO member.  We’re supposed to get along with our NATO members, and Turkey is a NATO member.  Do people want us to start shooting at a NATO member?  That would be a first.  And that’s all involved having to do with NATO.\nYeah.\nQ    Mr. President, you’re going to be seeing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi today.  How do you anticipate that conversation?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I’d say this: I think that she’s done this country a tremendous disservice.  She’s created a phony witch hunt — another one.  The first one failed.  They’re all failing.  This one is just absolutely crazy.  All you have to do is read the transcript of the call.  Read the transcript.  This is a open and shut, simple case.  They’re desperate because they know they’re going to lose the election.  They’re desperate to do something because they know they’re going to lose the election.\nThis administration has created the strongest economy in the history of our country.  We have the greatest stock market.  We had — over 100 times, we broke the record for stock market.  People’s — if you look at people’s stocks, their 401(k)s; if you look at anything you want to look at, they’re far better off now than they probably ever have been in this country.  Record stock markets.  And don’t forget, stock market is not just rich people; it’s all people.  Because all people own in the stock markets.  The New York Stock Exchange, all of them — they’re at record highs.   Nobody has ever done what we’ve done.\nSo, they’re playing games.  They figure they can’t win the election, so maybe we can find some ground.  “We’ll get somebody that Trump never met, and maybe they’ll say something bad about Trump.  And if they do really bad, maybe it can stick a little bit.”  I don’t think it’s going to work.  They’ve treated the Republican Party with great disrespect.\nOkay, thank you very much.\nQ    Mr. President, how was your meeting with the Dunn family yesterday?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  My meeting with the family was really — it was beautiful, in a certain way.  They did not want to meet with the person in question.  But we had a very good meeting.  They’re very nice people.  And we met with the full group.  It was four people, actually, as you — you know how it’s all broken up.  And the meeting took place right here at about 6 o’clock last night, and it was very sad, to be honest.  She lost, and they lost, their son.  I believe it was going down the wrong way, because that happens in Europe.  You go to Europe and the roads are opposite.  And it’s very tough.\nIf you’re from the United States, you do make that decision to make a right turn where you’re supposed to make a left turn.  The roads are opposite.  And she said that’s what happened.  That happens to a lot of people, by the way.  But she said that’s what happened.  She was in the room right out there.  We met right here, in these — this area.  And I offered to bring the person in question in, and they weren’t ready for it.  But I did offer.\nI spoke with Boris.  He asked me if I’d do that, and I did it.  Unfortunately, they wanted to meet with her, and unfortunately when we had everybody together, they decided not to meet.  Perhaps they had lawyers involved by that time.  I don’t know exactly.  I know the people were lovely.  They were very nice.  And they were, you know, desperately sad.\nQ    And, sir, did you suggest that the family had indicated at one point that they were interested in meeting with her?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I thought they were.  Based on what I saw, they wanted to meet.  But now they say they only want to meet if they’re in the UK.  And that’ll be up to them.  But I did meet the family, and I expressed condolences on behalf of our country.\nThank you very much, everybody.\nQ    Mr. President, because you’re winning so much with the WTO, because you’re growing the biggest economy —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Wait, there’s a great question I’m being asked.  This is maybe the greatest question I’ve been asked in a long time.  Please put those mics over here.  Go ahead.\nQ    Because you’re winning with the WTO, because you’re growing the biggest economy the world, are you willing to give Italy a break on tariffs?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  We are looking at Italy very strongly.  And, as you know, the seven and a half is to be divided the way we say.  We’ve divided it up.  Italy has got a problem with the way we’ve divided it up because they said they had much less to do with it, and Germany had more to do with it, and France had more to do with it, as an example.  So we are going to look at that very strongly.  Ambassador Lighthizer is here.  We’re going to look at it very strongly.\nOkay?  Thank you.  Good question.  I love that question.\nThank you all very much.  Thank you.\nQ    Are you going to open up the meeting with Pelosi?  Are you going to open up the meeting with Pelosi and bring us in?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, I’ll bring you in, right?  I’ll bring you in.  They’re doing a bad thing.  I’ll talk to you.  I’ll talk to you.\nThank you very much, everybody.\nSteve, please treat them nicely.  Treat Italy nicely, please.\nQ    The translator did an amazing job.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Huh?\nQ    The translator did an amazing job.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.  That doesn’t always happen.  Thank you.\nEND\n11:06 A.M.

        "text": "Rose Garden3:23 P.M. EDT\nPresident Trump Honors 2019 Stanley Cup Champions!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  It’s a great honor today.  These are great champions behind me, great athletes.  I always respect great athletes.  But they’re also very smart, because you can’t win unless you’re smart.  It takes more than just the muscles, right?  I think we’ve all learned that.\nToday, it’s my pleasure to welcome the Stanley Cup Champions, the St. Louis Blues.  I watched it very carefully.  I watched that season, and I saw, gee, they’re not doing very well this year.  But you’ll see the story; it’s an amazing story of comebacks.\nCongratulations to Head Coach Craig Berube and the Blues organization.  And I just want to congratulate you guys.  That is something.  (Applause.)  Fantastic.  Fantastic.  And the entire team on winning your first Stanley Cup.  And you’ll probably have many more, based on what I’m hearing.\nWe’re delighted to be joined by Second Lady Karen Pence.  Karen, thank you very much.  Appreciate it.  (Applause.)  Mike is getting ready to make a big trip.  He’ll be leaving tomorrow.  We have a delegation leading today.  And Mike is heading it up with Secretary Pompeo.  They’ll be leaving tomorrow.\nAnd we’re having very strong talks with a lot of people.  We want to bring our soldiers back home after so many years.  And they’re the greatest warriors in the world.  They’re policing.  They’re not a police force; they’re a different kind of a force.\nWe want to bring our soldiers back home.  And we’re being very tough on Turkey and a lot of others.  They have to maintain their own properties now.  They have to maintain peace and safety.  And we’ll see what happens — the delegation.  We’re asking for a ceasefire.  We put the strongest sanctions that you can imagine, but they get a lot.  We have a lot in store if they don’t — if they don’t have an impact, including massive tariffs on steel.  They ship a lot of steel to the United States.  They make a lot of money shipping steel.  They won’t be making so much money.\nI just want to tell you that the stock market is way up today because of probably the trade deal that we made with China. We made a fantastic deal.  You guys would’ve been very proud of it.  Your agents would’ve been — (laughter) — your agents would’ve been very proud.  Those agents, right?  They sit in bed, they weigh 350 pounds, and they complain: “You’re not playing very well today.  Come on.”  (Laughter.)  So — the good, old agents.  But they would’ve been proud.\nWe’re going to be selling to China about $50 billion worth of farm agricultural products.  And — it’s amazing.  (Applause.)  And China has been great.  China has really been great on this.  And we have a phase two, and we’re doing a lot with banking and with financial services already in phase one.  Phase one is massive, actually.  It’s probably the simpler stuff, but, in some ways, maybe it’s the most complicated.  But it’s very big numbers.\nSo I hear the most the farmers ever did was $16 billion, so I said, “Ask for 70.”  They said, “No, you don’t mean 70.  Sixteen.  Ask for 70.”  I said, “Yeah, ask for 70.”  So we agreed on 50.  And the only problem is they say the farmers can’t produce it; it’s too much.  I said, “Don’t reduce it.”  My people said, “All right, make it 20.”  I said, “No, make it 50.  Let the farmers tell me we can’t do it.”  The farmers will never say that because they’ll do it.  You guys know that, right?\nSo we have $50 billion worth of agriculture.  It’s the largest contract of its kind, by three times, ever signed.  And China is starting immediately, even though the agreement will take — Gary, you get agreements done much more quickly.  Gary Bettman, what a job.  But the agreement will take probably until Chile.  We’re going to Chile for a meeting — as you know, a summit.\nAnd — hello, Mr. Senator.  Look at my two great senators.  Roy, stand up — even though I’m going to introduce you in a second.  (Applause.)  How’s our young — how’s our young, incredible — how’s our young, incredible Josh doing?  Good job?  Come on.  Stand up, Josh.  What a job.  (Applause.)\nRoy and I said back — we said, “We need somebody that’s really outstanding to beat her.”  I won’t mention names.  (Laughter.)  And they had four or five candidates.  I looked at four or five candidates.  I said, “I want him.”  And he really, under pressure, was unbelievable.  Thank you very much.  We made a good choice, Roy, right?  What do you think?  Yes?  One thing with Roy, he’ll tell if it was no good.  He’ll tell you now.  (Applause.)  It’s always dangerous.  Right, Josh?  Anyway, congratulations.  Great job.\nBut we’re delighted to be joined also by Secretary Alex Azar, who has been fantastic; and Andrew Wheeler, EPA — Andrew, thank you very much; and Robert Lighthizer.  How are you doing with trade with other countries?  Doing all right?  All he does is contracts.  He does contracts.  In fact, he probably wants to leave now because he’s got another contract.  We just did one with Japan.  We just did one with South Korea.  China is happening.  Mexico, Canada is happening, if they can ever get it approved.  I doubt they will because it’s Nancy Pelosi.  (Laughter.)  They’re too busy working on impeachment.\nAnd, by the way, we just hit the greatest economy we’ve ever had.  “Let’s impeach the President.”  Isn’t that a good idea?  (Laughter.)  I wouldn’t worry about it, fellas.  (Laughter.)  I wouldn’t worry about it.  Don’t — don’t worry too much.\nHow are we doing, Roy?  Okay in the Senate?  I hear we’re looking very good.  I hear our senators — they’re the greatest.\nI want to start by introducing a man that I’ve known a little bit, but he’s been a great business success: Tom Stillman.  He’s the majority owner of the St. Louis Blues.  And Tom became the chairman of the Blues — had a great success in business, but we won’t bore them with that.  And — tremendous success, actually.  Became the chairman of the Blues.  And, in May of 2012, when he took over, he said, “I have a plan for five years, six years, eight years.  We got to make — we have to have a champion.”  And within seven years, they won the Stanley Cup — the beautiful Stanley Cup, right here.  (Applause.)  So that’s a great job.\nYou know, he wasn’t on the list to introduce.  I said, “Wait a minute, he’s the owner.”  They want to introduce everybody but the owner.  I said, “Give me a little information.”  That’s a very good thing — seven years.  We’ve been waiting a little longer than that in New York, you know?  (Laughter.)  We’ve been waiting, but we’ll get there.  We’re going to get there.\nWe also have some very proud Blues fans here with us.  And we just introduced Senator Roy Blunt, who is a fantastic man, a great friend of mine.  He’s done an incredible job, and he loves your state very much.  He loves your team.  He loves your team.  Roy, thank you very much.\nAnd, as I said, Josh Hawley — (applause) — who is a young, brilliant star of the Senate.  And he’s been doing fantastically well.  And I want to thank you very much, Josh, for the job you’re doing.\nRepresentatives Mike Bost — where’s Mike?  Mike.  Stand up, Mike.  Just stand up as I introduce.  You got so many political people here.  They’re so — they’re so afraid of not being here.  They’ll lose half of their vote if they’re not here today.  (Laughter.)  They all came back early because they didn’t want to not be here.  Right, Mike?\nRodney Davis — a great guy.  Thank you, Rodney.  John Katko.  The great Billy Long.  Thanks, John.  Where’s Billy?  Billy, do an auction for the St. — auction the team off, please.\nREPRESENTATIVE LONG:  (Inaudible) auction the Stanley Cup.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, come on.  Come on over here, Billy.  Come here.  (Laughter and applause.)  Auction.  Auction off the Stanley Cup.  And he didn’t know I was going to — you won’t believe this.\nREPRESENATIVE LONG:  And I — I’ve never been to auction school either, so.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  (Inaudible) buy the Stanley Cup.\nREPRESENATIVE LONG:  All right, going to buy the Stanley Cup here.  Hey, here — taking 25.  What do you — 30 thousand dollars?  How about a 30?  Thirty-five?  Forty.  You able to buy 45?  Forty-five?  Fifty.  Fifty thousand dollars.  Now going to buy 60.  Now going to buy — get that satisfied look off your face.  You’re out!  (Laughter.)  Sixty-five.  Seventy.  I have — sold at $65,000!  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I’ll take it.  (Inaudible.)  Thank you.\nREPRESENTATIVE LONG:  Hey, will you sign this?  The last one brought $15,000.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I will.  Give me a pen.\nREPRESENTATIVE LONG:  He signed my St. Jude tie at the State of the Union.  We gave the money — we auctioned it off for $15,000 to St. Jude.  He’s going to sign this one here.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I will sign it.\nREPRESENTATIVE LONG:  This will be in next year’s auction.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  This was not planned, by the way.  (Applause.)\nREPRESENTATIVE LONG:  What do you mean it wasn’t planned?  That plan — they stopped me at the gate.  They said, “Stand over here.”  They didn’t know I was coming!  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Billy.  Oh, Billy.  (Laughter.)  Pretty — pretty good job, though.  Didn’t he do — isn’t that pretty good?  I think it’s pretty good.\nAnd Blaine.  Where’s Blaine?  Blaine Luetkemeyer.  A friend of mine.  Good.  Thank you, Blaine.  Great job.  (Applause.)  That’s a great job.\nJason Smith.  (Applause.)  Jason.  Thank you, Jason.\nA great hockey player — I must tell you, I’m not sure we’re in that category, though, Pete.  Right?  What do you think?  I know you were really good.  Do you know that he was a great player in his own right?  Okay?  Pete Stauber.  Yeah.  He was a good one.  (Applause.)\nAnd Ann Wagner.  She wasn’t a great player, but she’s a great person.\nREPRESENTATIVE WAGNER:  (Inaudible.)  (Laughter and applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thanks, Ann.\nMissouri Governor, Mike Parson.  Mike, great job.  (Applause.)  And Attorney General Eric Schmitt.  Eric.  (Applause.)\nAnd many other leaders — great leaders.  And another leader — and I introduced him a little bit before, but the NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman.  I’ve known him so long; I refuse to say how long.  It’s a lot of years, right?  A lot of years.  A lot of success, too.  Way to go, Gary.  Way to go.  It’s an honor to have you.  (Applause.)\nSo what we were alluding to before is: In 2019, when the year started, you were true underdogs.  Midway through the season, the Blues were ranked last in the NHL.  I can’t believe that, fellas.  But don’t worry, it gets better.  (Laughter.)\nYou only had 15 wins, you had 18 losses, and 4 ties.  On January 6th, fresh off another really bad loss — a hard one; it was close, but it was bad — a few of the Blues players — it’s still a loss, right?  The losses are no good no matter by what.  Does it matter if you lose them close, Tom, or — a loss is a loss, right?\nMR. STILLMAN:  It’s a loss.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, I think so.  At least you have a little hope when they’re close, right?\nBut they gathered at a bar in Philadelphia where they heard the 1982 hit, “Gloria.”  That’s where you were — that’s why we were playing that song, for those of you that don’t know what’s happened here.  (Laughter.)  “Gloria.”\nThe next day, you shut out the Flyers, who were hot, and “Gloria” became your new “win song.”  It was a “win song”; that’s why we played it.  So now everybody gets it, otherwise the fake news would be criticizing me.  (Laughter.)  They’d say, “What kind of a song — you’re playing this song.  What does that have…”\nLook at that guy.  Look at that mouth on that guy.  Come here a minute.  (Laughter.)  Come here.  Come here.\nDo you think he’s taken a few hits?  (Applause.)  Huh?  Do you think he’s tough?  Do you think I could take him in a fight?  I don’t know.  I don’t know.  Great.  Wow.  How do mine look?  (Laughter.)  No hockey.  That’s great.\nOver the next few weeks, the Blues notched 11 straight wins, the longest winning streak in team history, and soon earned a place in the playoffs.\nIn the first round, you took on the Winnipeg Jets.  Moments away from overtime in game five, the Blues’ left wing, Jaden Schwartz, scored the winning goal in the last 15 seconds of regulation.  And everybody else just took a deep breath and said, “That was close.”  Where’s Jason?  Jason?\nMR. PIETRANGELO:  Jaden.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh, Jaden.  Come here.  Say a few words.  Jaden.\nMR. SCHWARTZ:  Oh, boy.  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Jaden.  And they say he’s a great golfer, but —\nMR. SCHWARTZ:  Well — (laughter) — I wouldn’t be able to score if it wasn’t for partner passing me the puck.  Where are you, Tyler?  Golf partner, too.\nUndefeated.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Ooh.\nMR. SCHWARTZ:  If you want to take us on sometime —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  (Laughter.)\nMR. SCHWARTZ:  — let us know.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic job.  (Applause.)  Fantastic.  Thank you, Jaden.\nThe next game, St. Louis clinched the series after Jaden scored all three — Jaden, you’re pretty good — (laughter) — all three of the Blues’ goals.  And, Jaden, your persistence made you the Blues’ leader in the playoff goal scoring.  That’s a great job.  After winning two more series, the Blues were off to the legendary Stanley Cup Finals, which everybody watches, everybody loves.  Very special.\nIt was a matchup for the ages.  With the series tied at 3-3, the Blues headed to Boston for the final showdown against a great team.  Watching from the bleachers was your biggest fan, 11-year-old Laila Anderson, who is here with us today.  (Applause.)  Where’s Laila?  Laila, stand up.  Come on up here, Laila.  Come on up here.  Good job.  (Applause.)\nSo, you all know Laila.  Laila is a bigger celebrity than our two senators.  (Laughter.)  They just hope that she’s not going to be running against them someday.  But it’s a — really, an extraordinary story of a very heroic young woman.\nThroughout the season, Laila was bravely battling an extremely rare, life-threatening immune disease called HLH.  Blues players visited her in the hospital constantly, and they hosted a bone marrow registry drive to help her get lifesaving treatment.  Laila’s mother, Heather, said — who is here — “These boys are what keeps [her] going.  They’re just incredible, incredible young men.”  Thank you very much for being here.  (Applause.)  Very — very nice.  Very nice.\nLaila received a bone marrow transplant in January and was strong enough to cheer the team on to victory in the final game. Laila, your exceptional courage and, frankly, the fact that you brought the team some luck — which is important, right?  We all need a little of that.  But we just want to thank you.  You inspired the Blues all season, and today you continue to inspire all Americans.  We all know your story.\nRight now, see all of those people back there?  See?  They look so friendly; they’re not.  (Laughter.)  They’re not.  They’re tougher than these guys, okay?  But I’ll bank on these guys.  So congratulations, darling.  You take care of yourself, okay?\nMS. ANDERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, honey.  Be careful.\nSo, the Stanley Cup Final was an extraordinary finish to a miraculous season.  So you think of that, and that’s what we’re referring to.  They started off so bad.  It was so bad that even the commissioner was telling me it wasn’t looking too good for this team.  Right?  But they — they set records.\nWhen the puck dropped, the Blues did not strike right away.  You only knew it took one shot on goal until the final minutes of the first period.  Then, Stanley Cup MVP — what happened to Jaden with all the goals you — (laughter) — I think Jaden should be the MVP.  No, I’m only kidding.  (Laughter.)  Where’s Ryan?  Ryan O’Reilly.  (Applause.)  Where’s Ryan?\nMR. STILLMAN:  He’s over here.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Come here.  Come on up.  That’s pretty good. Say a couple of words.\nThanks, Ryan.  That’s enough.  (Laughter.)\nMR. O’REILLY:  Well, I couldn’t do it without these guys behind me.  And we’re a great team and it was a heck of a run.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And you’re not Irish, are you, by any chance?\nMR. O’REILLY:  (Laughs.)  I am.  I am.  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Great going, Ryan.  (Applause.)\nRyan O’Reilly.  He scored the first goal of the game and became the first player since Wayne Gretzky — a great guy; really, a fantastic guy — in 1985 to score four consecutive Cup Final games.  He scored in all of them.  Ryan, congratulations on winning the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nAs the first period came to a close, Team Captain Alex Pietrangelo — where is he?\nMR. PIETRANGELO:  Right here.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Where’s Alex?  Come on over here.\nMR. PIETRANGELO:  Oh, boy.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Look at this guy.  Come on, say a couple of words, Alex.  Look, see that?\nMR. PIETRANGELO:  Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You don’t even get that for sports, right?\nMR. PIETRANGELO:  No, no, no, no.  (Laughter.)  This is a bigger deal than the sports.  This is pretty cool.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  This is part of everything.\nMR. PIETRANGELO:  Yeah, it’s a pretty good group of guys back here, huh?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You better believe it.\nMR. PIETRANGELO:  Yeah, big golfers.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.\nMR. PIETRANGELO:  Big golfers.  I know you like that.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.\nMR. PIETRANGELO:  Well, thanks for having us.  We appreciate it.  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Great job.\nMR. PIETRANGELO:  Appreciate it.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Thank you, Alex.\nAlex rushed forward and found that the back of the net was his, taking a two-nothing lead.  But Boston didn’t let up.  It’s a tough team.  And I know the owner too.  How’s he doing?  Okay?  Good man, right?  Not so happy, unfortunately.  But he’s my friend.  But he wasn’t so happy.\nThe Bruins took 33 shots on net during the game, and the Blues rookie goaltender — that’s pretty good — Jordan Binnington — where’s Jordan?  Jordan.  I got to find — come here.  (Applause.)  He stopped 32 of 33, so why didn’t you stop the other one, Jordan?  You could have made the game a lot easier.  Come on.  (Laughter.)\nMR. BINNINGTON:  Yeah, first off, you know, that’s my bad, I guess.  (Laughter.)  Could have had a shut-out there.  But, you know, we went all that way so we had to finish the job and —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You did it.\nMR. BINNINGTON:  — it was a great game.  And, yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic.\nMR. BINNINGTON:  We’re happy we’re here.  Thanks.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So have you always had good reflexes?\nMR. BINNINGTON:  I guess so.  Yeah.  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  If you didn’t, you’d be in trouble.\nMR. BINNINGTON:  Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  If you didn’t, it wouldn’t — wouldn’t be pretty.\nMR. BINNINGTON:  I don’t think I’d be here.  No.  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I don’t think you’d be — I don’t think you’d be here, right?\nMR. BINNINGTON:  No.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s — great job, Jordan.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\nThirty-two of thirty-three.  I guess that’s good.  Commissioner, that’s pretty good, right?  I think so.\nJordan, your astounding 97 percent save percentage held Boston to a single goal.  That’s pretty good, huh?  After 52 years, the Blues finally, and triumphantly, raised the Stanley Cup.  That’s amazing.  Fifty-two years.  And you did it in seven, huh?  Come here.  (Applause.)\nAnd the St. Louis Blues’ amazing comeback reminds us to never give up, never lose faith, never, ever quit.  Just keep forging ahead.  You never know.  Just keep forging ahead.  But this team is really exemplary.  Starting a season so badly, where they were in last place and people had written them off.  And I think your fans are so loyal, frankly.  They don’t stop coming, Roy, do they?  I don’t think so.  Josh, they came anyway.  But they probably, sort of, gave up.  They started — some of them.  But it’s incredible.  Think of that: So they had a record streak, and then all of a sudden, they’re in it and then they win and they keep winning.\nWhen you work hard, support each other, believe in yourself, and give everything you’ve got, victory is always within reach.\nTo the St. Louis Blues: Congratulations again on your unforgettable season — that was a really a tremendous final; incredible — and the thrilling Stanley Cup win.\nAnd it’s now my honor to invite up the Chairman — the man that we’ve been talking about — seven — and we’re going to call him Seven-Year Tom.  That’s actually a very quick period of time.  But he’s a great gentlemen and he’ll say a few words about the team.  Thank you.\nTom Stillman.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nMR. STILLMAN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And thanks so much for welcoming us to the White House today.  It is a really an honor to be here and to be here with you.  It’s also an honor to be here with the group of guys that’s behind me here.  They showed tremendous not only skill and ability in their sport, but great character and persistence.  I think they serve as a model for not only our sport, but other sports, about how to — how to live your life and, as you said, never giving up.  So, it’s a proud moment to be here with all of them.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And, Tom, you worked here, didn’t you?  Right in the area.  You were working in government.\nMR. STILLMAN:  I did work in government for a while.  I was over there at the — at the Commerce Department in export controls for a while.  So —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, if you ever get tired of doing this, maybe we can get you get back over there. (Laughter.)\nMR. STILLMAN:  I’m sticking with hockey.  (Laughter and applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good decision.  Tom, maybe the coach would like to say a few words.\nMR. STILLMAN:  Yes.  (Laughs.)  Sure.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Come on over, Coach.\nMR. BERUBE:  Thank you.  Just on behalf of the team and the Blues organization, we just want to thank the — Mr. President for having us here today.  It’s a great honor to come here.\nYou know, we won the Stanley Cup, I think, once we got our team working together and playing together.  When you — when you play as a team, day in and day out, it’s hard to get your — hard — you’re going to be hard to beat.  So that’s what it basically boiled down to.\nThese guys all came together as a team and played for each other, and we ended up being champions.\nBut thank you again for having us, on behalf of the organization.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  How is it going this year, Coach?  How’s it going so far this year?\nMR. BERUBE:  It’s all right.  Up and down a little bit.  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Better than — hey, better than last year, huh?\nMR. BERUBE:  Yeah, better.  It’s been a little bit better.  We’ve been on a — quite a road trip here.  A lot of stuff going on.  Up in Canada, we went to the Hockey Hall of Fame, and we presented a Stanley Cup Ring to the Hockey Hall of Fame.  So, these guys are going through a lot right now with a lot of travel and everything.  And come — you know, coming here.  It’s a great honor.  It’s a — you know, we love it all, but it’s just a lot on everybody right now.  But we’re getting home here today and —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  But now the pressure is off because you’ve done it, so there’s a lot less pressure.\nMR. BERUBE:  Well, I don’t know about that.  I mean — (laughter).  Thank you again, for having us.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Great job.  (Applause.)  I just want to say, “Great job.”  It’s an honor to have all of you folks here.  And, Gary, congratulations.  Fantastic sport.\nMR. STILLMAN:  May I?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Please.\nMR. STILLMAN:  Mr. President, on — (applause) — on behalf of the St. Louis Blues organization and all of our fans back in St. Louis, the other members of our ownership group here today, our whole team, including the on-ice team and the rest of the Blues organization, we’d like to present you this jersey.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Wow.  Whoa.\nMR. STILLMAN:  This is our Stanley Cup Championship jersey.  I think it’ll be just right on the golf course.  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s beautiful.  Would you like to introduce your other owners?  Would you like to do that?\nMR. STILLMAN:  Sure.  Let’s see.  We have Donn Lux, Jim Kavanaugh — (applause) — Steve Maritz, Scott McCuaig, Tom Schlafly, Jim Cooper.  And — am I missing anybody?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Any other owners?\nMR. STILLMAN:  And John Ross, as well.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Any other owner out there?\nMR. STILLMAN:  (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you all very much.  Appreciate it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  See you soon.  (Applause.)\nEND\n3:46 P.M. EDT\n",

EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.  It is a great honor to be here.  Tony; Pastor Brunson, who I have gotten to know very well — that was not easy, but we got him out, and got him back to his family.  (Applause.)  And I want to thank you for that beautiful prayer.  It means a lot.\nThis evening, I am deeply honored to be back with so many pastors and leaders and friends and patriots at the 2019 Values Voter Summit.  (Applause.)  You are the warriors on the frontiers defending American freedom.  We meet tonight at a crucial moment in our nation’s history.  Our shared values are under assault like never before.  Extreme left-wing radicals, both inside and outside government, are determined to shred our Constitution and eradicate the beliefs we all cherish.  Far-left socialists are trying to tear down the traditions and customs that made America the greatest nation on Earth.  They reject the principles of our Founding Fathers — principles enshrined into the Declaration of Independence, which proclaims that our rights come from our creator.  (Applause.)\nBut despite the delusions of the radical left, all of us here today know that our rights come from God almighty, and they can never be taken away.  (Applause.)\nTogether, we will protect those God-given rights for our children, our children’s children, and generations of Americans to come.  On every front, the ultra-left is waging war on the values shared by everyone in this room.  They are trying to silence and punish the speech of Christians and religious believers of all faiths.  You know it better than anyone.  They are trying to use the courts to rewrite the laws, undermine democracy, and force through an agenda they can’t pass at the ballot box.  They just can’t seem to do it, can they?\nThey are trying to hound you from the workplace, expel you from the public square, and weaken the American family, and indoctrinate our children.  They resent and disdain faithful Americans who hold fast to our nation’s historic values.  And, if given the chance, they would use every instrument of government power, including the IRS, to try to shut you down.  They are using the IRS against me.\nGenerations of Americans before us did not work.  They fight, they sacrifice, they do so much, but we will never ever — no matter what happens — surrender our liberty.  The word “liberty” is so important.  To the radical left: Together we will stand up to the socialists and we will win massive victories for family, for faith, and for freedom, just like the victory we had in 2016.  (Applause.)  Thank you.\nWith every bit of heart and soul, we will defend our country — the most just and virtuous republic in the history of the Earth.  And yet I say that, and those words are beautiful, but it is starting to change.  And we’re going to stop that start.  (Applause.)\nThe hateful spirit that consumes the modern left violates every tenant of the American tradition.  The radical left tolerates no dissent.  It permits no opposition.  It accepts no compromise.  And we — look, we have all seen it; we see what’s going on.  There is no compromise.  Frankly, these people are crazy.  (Laughter and applause.)  They’re crazy.  They are crazy.  I shouldn’t say it, because we’re all the same, but they are crazy.  (Laughter.)\nAnd as we have seen in the last three years, the extreme left has absolutely no respect for the will of the American people.  They are determined to stop our movement and impose their agenda by any means necessary.  It makes no difference to them.\nFirst, it was the Russia hoax.  It was a total hoax — made up.  Then there was the outrageous smearing of Justice Kavanaugh — that goes on.  They want him impeached, even when the woman said, “I don’t know that anything happened.  Nothing happened.”  They said, “Let’s impeach him anyway.”  And the whole thing was phony.  So phony.  He’s a good man.  What he’s gone through, I don’t know if anyone’s ever gone through anything like that.\nYou know, when I chose Justice Kavanaugh, I said, “Brett, congratulations.  I’m choosing you.”  Many years, they were talking he would be on the Supreme Court.  He said, “Sir, this is the greatest honor of my life.”  This was in the White House.  “It’s the greatest honor of my life.”\nI said, “Brett, this will go so fast.  This will be so easy.  You’re perfect.”  (Laughter.)  “You have the perfect family, the perfect wife, the perfect education.  You’re the best student.  You went to the best school.  They’ve been talking about you for 10 years.  This will go quick and easy.”  (Laughter.)  So much for predictions, folks.  (Laughter.)\nBut we stuck with him, I’ll tell you.  A lot — a lot of people said, “Let’s do it (inaudible).”  (Applause.)  Plenty of people said, “Cut him loose, President.  Cut him loose, President.”   You know that.  You know a lot of the people — a couple of the people in this room.  I love you; I’m never going to reveal your name, but the people in this room.  They said, “Cut him loose, President.  Cut him loose.”\nI said, “Can’t do it.  He’s done nothing wrong.  They’re phony stories about him.  They were made up, just like they were made up about me and other people.  They were phony stories.  Can’t do it, I’m sorry.”\nAnd we got him through.  And I give a lot of respect to those people that went up there, and they endured a lot.  That was the worst thing that many people have seen in this country for years.  Justice Kavanaugh.  It’s a big moment in our country’s history.\nAnd now it is the outrageous impeachment — look, impeachment.  I never thought I’d see or hear that word with regard to me — “impeachment.”  I said, the other day, “It’s an ugly word.”  To me, it’s an ugly word — a very ugly word.  It means so much.  It means horrible, horrible crimes and things.  I can’t even believe it.\nIt’s a witch hunt.  It’s based on a single phone call of congratulations to the President of Ukraine, which they fraudulently mischaracterized to sound absolutely horrible.  This crooked Adam Schiff —\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — made a statement — long, beautiful statement — and it was a fraud.  He repeated my call, but it wasn’t me.  He made it so bad.  And I said, “Oh, I’m going to go after him.”  They say, “Sir…”  (Applause.)  They say, “Sir, he has immunity because he said it in Congress.  He has immunity.”  I say, “I don’t care about immunity.  He can’t have immunity; he made up a phone call.”\nBut then I did something that they didn’t expect.  I immediately called up Ukraine, through my representatives — in this case, our great Secretary of State, who’s doing a fantastic job.  Mike Pompeo.  (Applause.)  And got approval — because I have to do this, because I don’t like the idea of having these calls — do you do how bad that is for us as a nation?  And got approval to immediately make that call public.\nAnd they thought it was strange, you know?  They thought it was a little bit strange.  “Why would you want to do that?”  You know, other countries are looking at us like, “What the hell is going on in the United States?”  (Laughter.)  Seriously.\nNow, does this mean that every leader that I deal with — and we do great things.  Look at we did yesterday with China for our farmers and for our people.  (Applause.)  But does that mean, every time I speak to the head of a country, they’re afraid that it’s going to be broadcast all over the world?  You’re never going to be able to speak properly to anybody, to make a deal, to do good things for the people, and — even the people of the world.\nSo we had a perfect call.  It was congenial.  It was just absolutely nice.  Totally different than the phony thing that he revealed with this crazy whistleblower.  The whistleblower said “quid pro quo” eight times.  It was a little off — no times.  (Laughter and applause.)  (Inaudible.)\nAnd when you hear Schiff — “We won’t give you that money unless you do this.”  It had nothing to do — it wasn’t even discussed.  It was a terrible, terrible fraudulent thing.  And then Nancy Pelosi went on television.  She was very angry when she read the actual call, because this was an exact — I guess stenographers, they took it down.\nAnd she was very angry because she got led — she was a day early when she started talking about impeachment.  But that did not matter to her.  “Let’s do it anyway.”  And for those of you that think she was reasoned for the last six months — you know, when she said, “No, no, no.  We need more…”  I said, “She’s going to do it.  She just wants to have it carried out closer to the election.  She’s going to do it.”\nNot a good person.  I think she hates our country.  Because if she didn’t hate our country, she wouldn’t be doing this to our country.  It’s a fraud.  It’s a fraud.  (Applause.)\nBut she said to George Stephanopoulos — I give him credit — “No, no, he said the truth.”  Stephanopoulos said, “No, no, but that wasn’t what he said.  He said an entirely — this was totally different.”  “No, no, he said it.”\nIn other words, they’re of the opinion — you know, just keep saying it, saying it, saying it, and maybe someday they’ll believe it.\nAnd, frankly, if I weren’t there, because I was incredulous — I couldn’t believe it.  I heard it.  I said, “That’s not what I said.”  He made up a conversation.  And it was vicious, what he said.\nAnd then we caught him.  And I said, “He has to pay a big price.”  And they said, “Sir, he has total immunity because he was in the great chamber, talking to congressmen, talking to the American public, lying and cheating, and there’s supposed to be nothing we can do about it.”  But he also went outside and, as usual, he talked to the press, and he said a lot of what he said to the press.  So we’re going to take a look at it.  We are going after these people.  These are bad, bad people.  (Applause.)\nI actually told my lawyers, I said, “Sue him anyway.”  He’s got immunity, but they can’t mean immunity for that.  I said, “Sue him anyway.  Even if we lose, the American public will understand.”  (Applause.)  And sue Nancy Pelosi, or maybe we should just impeach them.  Because they’re lying, and what they are doing is a terrible thing for our country.\nAnd the President of Ukraine said there was nothing wrong with the call.  And you heard the words; there was no pressure.  He didn’t even know what we were talking about.  He said, “No, it was a very nice call.”  He doesn’t know.  He tru- — I tell you what, I respect him so much.  Because a lot of times, they’re — “I do not want to comment.  I don’t want to get involved.”  He said, “It was a very nice call.”  There was nothing there.\nAnd people that read it after we gave the transcript said it was great.  I had one friend — very smart, brilliant lawyer, from New York.  “I didn’t like your call with Ukraine, Mr.  President.”  He used to call me Donald, now he calls me Mr.  President.  (Laughter.)  For the long- — 30 years, he calls me Donald, now it’s — all of these guys.  Nobody calls me Donald anymore.  I lost all my friends; they call me Mr.  President.  (Laughter.)  It’s true.  It’s true.\nHe goes, “Mr.  President…”  I keep saying, “Call me Donald.”  “President, I didn’t like — I didn’t like that call to the Ukrainian President.”  I said, “Really?  What do you mean?  What was wrong with it?”  “It was terrible, the way you threatened him.  It was horrible.”  I said, “I didn’t threaten him.”  “Of course you did.”  I said, “Where did you read it?  Did you read…”  “I didn’t read it.  I listened to what Adam Schiff was reading.  I assumed that was a correct statement.”  I said, “No.”\nHe then calls me back after reading it.  He said, “I can’t believe it.  I’ve never seen anything like that.”  A lot of people saw that.  A lot of people that thought it was bad, thought it was bad because they heard Adam Schiff.  And they don’t hear us talking.  They don’t know what we’re saying.  They hear — they think that, you know, it’s somebody standing — he’s reading it like I said it.  It is a terrible thing going on in this country.\nBut they’re using that call to impeach your President who won, in 2016, perhaps the greatest election of our time.  (Applause.)  And I won it for you; I didn’t win it for me.  I won it for you and others, I won it for you.  They are coming — I won it for you and others, but I won it for you.\nThey’re coming after me because I’m fighting for you.  It’s a big part of it.  (Applause.)  And I’m fighting for all Americans and our way of life, but I’m fighting for you.  And they don’t like you.  They don’t like you.  And you explain why.  You explain why.  Your values are so incredible.  They don’t like you.  Nobody in this room would do what Adam Schiff did.  Nobody would ever think of it.\nBy the way, he only did it because he never thought that I was going to release the transcript.  Had he thought I was — and I didn’t even know I was going to release anything before I did it.  But I said, “Release…”  How transparent can you get, right?\nThey’re saying we’re holding back.  Holding back?  I gave the transcript of the call.  But he did it and then I released the transcript.  They never thought in a million years — even in terms of violation with another country, but we got approval.\nSo, he’s very embarrassed, but he gets up to the microphone — remember he used to say, “Well, I have personal proof that the President was very closely aligned with Russia.  Russia.”  (Laughter.)  And I’m watching him and, even me, I’m starting to say, “Does he know something that I don’t know?” (Laughter.)\nYou know, he gets up with his very — very narrow neck.  You remember?  (Laughter.)  Pencil neck.  Dana, you would not be impressed with him, physically.  But he gets up — no dummy, but he’s a crooked person.  Smart guy.  He’s crooked as hell.  And this is what they’re using to — and they’re going to be very unsuccessful.  But that is what they are using — this call — to try to impeach the President of the United States, who did win one of the great elections of all time.  All time.  (Applause.)\nAnd it couldn’t have come at a better time, because if we would had lost that, we would have been in a lot of trouble.  We’d have had a very different country right now.  Even with China, the other day, they were saying it’s incredible what you’ve done.  Our economy is up many, many trillions of dollars.  Their economy is down many, many trillions of dollars.  (Applause.)  Big gap.\nWe would have been number two by now if our opponent had won.  They would have been way ahead of us, and now they’re way behind.  And that’s okay.\nWe made a great deal yesterday.  We have yet to get it papered, but we will.  Because they want to make that deal.  They want to make that deal because they’ve never had pressure like this.\nAnd I don’t blame China, by the way.  I blame the people that were leading our country for 25 years, allowing that to happen — where $500 billion is being taken out of our country and given to China so they can rebuild their entire empire.  So I never blamed China, and I say that openly.  I say it in every speech.  I don’t blame China.  I wish we could have done it to them.  I would have loved it.  (Laughter.)  And now maybe we are.  (Laughter and applause.)\nThey’re trying to destroy anyone opposed to their goal of fundamentally transforming the United States of America.  The one thing about the radical Democrats that is something that you have to admire: They stick together.  The Republicans don’t, and I love the Republicans.\nThey have horrible policies — the Democrats.  They are for sanctuary cities — the Democrats.  They are against strong, powerful, beautiful — I love our law enforcement.  (Applause.)  They believe in open borders, where anybody can come into our country — anybody.  You have to see.  And we’ve done a great job.  No support, only opposition.\nWe have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border and the numbers are dropped, like, off the table.  And I want to thank the President of Mexico and Mexico for doing an incredible job.  (Applause.)\nBut the Democrats have one thing: They stick together.  They’re like glue.  And it’s been that way for a long time — not just now.  For whatever it is, it’s been that way for a long time, and it’s the one trait that I do respect and even admire.  They stick together.  They don’t have people coming out against the President.\nAnd, you know, I am at 94 percent approval rating, but still you have people out there — they don’t get it.  They don’t get it.  So we love the Republicans.  We love what we’re doing.  We love our programs.  And in many cases, we’re better politicians than them.  We have much better policies.  We want strong borders.  We want powerful education.  We want freedom of speech.  We want a strong military.\nWe want a powerful Second Amendment, which they don’t want.  (Applause.)  Right, Dana?  They don’t want — I wouldn’t say they’re too much into the Second Amendment, the world of the Second Amendment.  I will tell you, if certain of these people — I would say almost anyone — your Second Amendment is in serious, serious trouble.  Serious trouble.\nSocialism is obsessed with the pursuit of power because it has replaced religion within government.  And in their eyes, it has absolutely replaced religion.  When you look at some of the things that they’re in favor of, it’s like, it’s like anything — nobody has ever seen anything like it.\nThe New Green or Green New — you can say it either way, by the way.  It doesn’t matter; same thing.  (Laughter.)  It doesn’t matter.  Somebody said, “Which comes first?”  I said, “It doesn’t make any difference.  They’re both crazy.”  (Laughter and applause.)  No cows, no planes, no people, no energy, no oil, no gas — no nothing.\nThis evening, we reaffirm true foundations of American society.  We believe that every American has the right to live by the dictates of their conscience and the teachings of their faith.  (Applause.)  We believe in the right to free exercise of religion.  (Applause.)  Thank you.\nAUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  All right, thank you very much.\nYou know, years ago, you could have said that, and people would have said, “Yes.”  And, you know, it would have been sort of routine.  Today, you say it and you get standing ovations, because we’re under assault.  Very simple.  We’re under assault.\nWe believe in the right to free speech.  We believe in the right to life.  (Applause.)  Thank you.\nWe know that families and churches, not government officials, know best how to create strong and loving communities.  It’s been that way in our country.  (Applause.)\nAnd above all else, we know this: In America, we don’t worship government, we worship god.  (Applause.)  Thank you.\nYou were there.  From the first minute of my presidency, I have taken historic action to defend religious liberty.  (Applause.)  Tony knows that very well.  Tony wasn’t sure — really sure I would say at the beginning.  What do you think? I don’t know him very well.  But I think you are very happy now, Tony.  Right? (Applause.)\nSomething I am very proud of: I stopped the Johnson Amendment from interfering with pastors’ rights to speak their mind.  You can say whatever you want, you’re the people we want to hear from.  We want to hear from you.\nWe are protecting the conscience rights and — think of this — those rights of doctors, and nurses, and teachers, and groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor.  They are incredible people.  And we are preserving our country’s vital tradition of faith-based adoption.  (Applause.)\nAs you know, just a few days ago, a Democrat running for President proposed revoking the tax-exempt status of many churches and religious groups.\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And you know why, and you know who it is.  He’s a wacko.  (Laughter.)\nI will never allow the federal government to be used to target, harass, or punish communities of faith.  And I will never allow the IRS to be used as a political weapon, as it has been and currently is — it is currently being used.  (Applause.)  But has been used so viciously, so violently against many people in this room.\nVirtually every top Democrat lawmaker also now supports taxpayer-funded abortion, right up to the moment of birth.  But it’s really now even worse than that.  The governor of Virginia — do you remember?  He was on a show and he talked.  People said, “What did you say?  What was that?”\nHe said, “The baby is born, then we have a conversation with the mother as to whether or not” — what he meant — “as to whether or not we execute the baby, because now it is an execution.”  And that was a very big moment.  And they don’t do anything about it.\nThat was an unbelievable moment for the people in this room.  For the people on the radical left, they didn’t understand what was wrong with what he said.  That’s where we’ve come.  But we’re going now in a different direction.  And don’t forget — (applause).\nWhen I go after what I call the “Fake News” — I call it the “Corrupt News” too, because it is stronger than fake.  But “fake” sort of reads a little better.  (Laughter.)  There they are.\nBut when I go after the Fake News, I had a magazine for one of the many covers — I’ve been on so many of the covers of this particular magazine — Time magazine.  And we were talking; they were in my office.  I figured, “Let me give a shot at having an interview.  Maybe I’ll get a better story out of these people.”\nSo we had a nice talk.  And I was talking about how unfairly the press treats me and you.  They treat us all very, very badly.  No matter what we do, doesn’t matter; it’ll never be considered good.  And if it’s just a neutral, it’s a horror.  And if it’s something bad — I hate to say it — it is like the electric chair, okay?  “Bring back the electric chair,” they say.\nBut I was talking and I was going off fact after fact after fact about how crooked and corrupt the media is.  Then I realized: I’m in the Oval Office.  And I said, “But I’m President and you’re not, so what’s this all about?”  (Laughter and applause.)  Right?  It’s true.  I’m saying, I’m going on for 20 minutes, ranting and raving.  And then I said, “Wait a minute, here I am.  Here I am.  The Resolute Desk — here it is.  It’s right there.”  (Laughter.)  And I walked away with a big smile on my face.  (Laughter and applause.)\nBut because of the late-term abortion — this is why I’ve asked Congress to prohibit the late-term abortion of babies, and it’s a big thing and had a lot of fighting.  You wouldn’t think there would be a lot of fighting.\nRemember the debate with Crooked Hillary, where I said she wants to rip the babies out of the womb in the ninth month?  And everybody said, “Wow.”  That’s the first time they heard that statement.  And you’re just lucky that we won — because we won.  I didn’t win; we won.  This would be a much different country.\nAnd, by the way, it’s like a plant.  You seed the plant, you put that plant in, but those roots have to gain.  That’s why we need the next four years.  We have to have — those roots, they have to grab on.  That’s why we need them.  (Applause.)\nWe’ve done so much.  There’s been no administration that’s done what we have done in the first two and a half years — now it’s almost three years.  If you look at everything we’ve done with taxes, and regulations, and Right to Try, and all of the different things that we’ve done.  The vets, the military — we’ve rebuilt our military.  (Applause.)\nWe had a general come to my office — respected general.  And we were having big trouble with one country — first week in office, very early.  He said, “Sir, we have no ammunition.”  I said, “You know what?  We’re going to have ammunition — a lot of it.  And hopefully we’ll never going to have to use it, but we have a lot of it.”  But I also said, “I never want to have another President of the United States hear those words from a general.”  Because does that put us in bad position, right?\nIn this administration, we believe every child, born and unborn, is made in the holy image of God.  (Applause.)  During my first week in office, I reinstated the Mexico City Policy to protect the lives of the unborn.  (Applause.)  We have issued a final rule to prohibit Title X taxpayer funding from subsidizing the abortion industry.  (Applause.)  We stopped federal funding of fetal tissue research.  (Applause.)\nMy administration has also made tremendous progress in fighting back against the left’s effort to use the federal courts to impose their fringe ideology and crush the same religious liberty that we have been speaking of tonight.  To defend our Constitution, we have confirmed more than 160 highly qualified judges to interpret the law as written, including two incredible new Supreme Court justices.  (Applause.)\nYou know, I have always heard that federal judges, judges, and Supreme Court justices — most important decision a President could make.  And I disagreed.  I always said, “You know, look, defense to me has got always to be number one.”\nBut I got it.  I said, “You know, it is.  It’s really incredible.”  And usually, when a President comes to office, there’s no — you have no vacancies.  Or the previous President would have — boom.  There should be no vacancy, you know, whatever their ideology is.\nBut I guess they thought that the crooked one was going to win or something.  (Laughter.)  So I came in and, in the first couple of days, they said, “By the way…”  You know, I had a couple of other things going, too — including the fact that a few minutes after I was sworn in, the Washington Post wrote a story that the impeachment starts right now.  You saw that, right?  Did you see that?\nRight after I got sworn — took the oath of office, they did that story — literally, a very few moments after the swearing-in — that the road to impeachment starts right now.\nBut I had a lot of other things.  But I said during the course of the first very early period, like a week — I said, “By the way, how many federal judgeships do I have?”  They said, “Sir, you have 142.”  I said, “What?”  (Laughter.)  “You have 142, sir.”  I said, “You’ve got to be kidding.  142?  You mean I have two, one, none?”  “No, you have 142.”\nAnd President Obama was not very good at getting it done, because, you know, people held him up and everything else.  But, with time, you get them all done.  You get them done.  But he put a big rush on at the end when he saw we were doing well in the polls, and coming up and up, and it wasn’t enough time.  So we inherited 142 open federal judgeships, including the court of appeals.  (Applause.)  First time in history.  First time in history anything like that has ever happened.\nAnd then they say, “Oh, he was a great President.  Oh, great.  He was great.”  Great for who?  He was great for us.  (Laughter.)  And in that way, he was.  There’s never been a better President for the Republicans in what they consider the most important way, Tony.  Gave us 142 judgeships on the first day in office.  (Laughter.)\nAnd you go back and check it out, you’ll find that others left none, usually none — or one or two — but one, none.  One hundred and forty-two.\nAnd then we have extras that we got through attrition, through retirement, through death.  And then we will very shortly — in less than a couple of months, we’ll have 182 federal judgeships, including — including appeals judges, court of appeals.  (Applause.)  One hundred and eighty-two.  (Inaudible.)\nAnd, you know, we were getting killed with the court decisions.  If you look at our first few months, I think it was oh for seven; oh for eight.  Then we won one, and a news- — a newspaper — I think it was the failing New York Times — what would they do without me?  You know, the paper was dead until I came along.\nTwo months before I ran, I remember holding one up, it was like from a grocery store.  You know, the things that you hand out?  It was like this.  (Laughter.)  It’s all right.  When we leave in 10 or 14 years, they’ll fail.  They’ll fail.  (Applause.)  I’m only kidding, by the way.  You know, they’ll take it for real.  “I told you he wants to stay.”\nDid you see the crazy comedian?  I won’t even give them the name, but you know who.  He said — he was interviewing a guest a couple of weeks ago.  He said — you know, a very liberal guest.  He said, “You know he’s going to win, don’t you?  You know he’s going to win.”  And the guest said, “No, no, we’re going to fight very hard.  We have a chance.  No, no, we’re going to fight.”  “No, no.  He’s going to win, and you know he’s not leaving after that, don’t you?”  (Laughter.)  “He’s going to stay.  There is no way we’re ever going to get him out of office.”  (Laughter.)\nAnd I thought that he was, you know, kidding.  He was really — believed it.  So, you know what?  Let him believe it.  I think it’s great.  Let him believe it.  (Applause.)  True.  Right?  He’s never leaving.\nIn recent years, the hard left has tried to muzzle Christian voices in their aggressive attack on free speech.  Last year, Isabella Chow, a member of student government at the University of California, Berkeley — slightly liberal out there — abstained from a campus vote that violated her Christian faith.\nShe was cruelly condemned by the student government and kicked out of nearly every single club of which she was a member at college.\nOn the day that members of student government condemned her — they went after her like nobody would believe — she sent out this message: The Christian community is here to love and serve this campus.  And Isabella is here somewhere tonight — where is Isabella?  Beautiful.  (Applause.)  We salute you.  Thank you very much, Isabella.\nTo safeguard the rights of students like Isabella, my administration has taken historic action to withhold taxpayer dollars — we’re talking about billions of dollars, by the way — from schools that infringe upon student’s First Amendment freedoms and other people’s First Amendment freedom.  (Applause.)\nDo you notice they’ve been treating us much better lately?  They’re saying, “You know, we better let this person speak.”  We get a lot of millions of dollars every year, these schools — all of a sudden, they’re letting them speak.  But they still don’t speak properly about us.  We don’t like that.  But it’s really had a big impact.\nTo support American families, we doubled the child tax credit and cut a record number of job-killing regulations.  (Applause.)\nWe’ve created over 6 million new jobs since the election; nobody would have believed that.  If I said that, Tony, the media back there — the wonderful people in the media — would have said, “He’s exaggerating.”  I would have never said “six,” actually.\nAnd you have to go by the day after the election, because, you know, when you look, the day after the election, there was euphoria and the market went up tremendously before signing.  And Obama gets credit.  The market was crashing.  The market would have gone down the tubes.  So I said, “Why did he get all of that upside?”  They only did the upside for two and a half months or whatever it was between, let’s say, November 9th and January 20th.  They only did the upside because we got elected.  (Applause.)  If he would have gotten elected, it would have not been a good situation.\nLast month, unemployment reached the lowest rate in over 51 years.  (Applause.)  And you have heard me say this: African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment rates have all set record lows.\nAnd women, 71 years — I’m sorry, you didn’t break a record.  But we’re doing very well with the women.  Do you know why?  Women are so smart, and they want safety, they want security, they want a great military, they want strong borders.  Remember last time?  “He will not get the women’s vote.  There is no way to get to 270.”  You needed 270 electoral votes.  “He will not get the women’s vote.”  Then, after the election, they said, “Man, he did good with the women.”  (Laughter and applause.)  “He did good with the women.”\nThis is like a tape recording — the same thing now.  “He will not get the women’s vote.”  I said, “Really? They don’t want to have a strong military?  They don’t want to have security?  They don’t want to have safety?”\nWe’re working harder than any other administration has ever worked on opioid and drugs, and our numbers are coming way down.  Nobody has seen numbers like this.  (Applause.)  Nobody has seen numbers like what we’ve done.\nWe’ve lifted 1.3 American children out of poverty.  Our agenda is lifting up Americans of every background, race, religion, color, and creed.  Last year, with the help of many faith leaders — many of you are in the room right now — I signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform into law.  Everybody wanted that.  (Applause.)  The African American community wanted it so badly.  They couldn’t get it.  President Obama couldn’t get it done.  Previous Presidents couldn’t get it done.  We got it done.\nTo protect the wellbeing of our citizens, we’re fighting violent crime — securing our border, building the wall.  And it is going up rapidly, by the way.  Rapidly.  (Applause.)  You think that was an easy one?  That was a tough one.  And it’s the — I said the “Rolls Royce.”  They criticized me on that.  They said that car is not made in the United States.  I said, “We’re building the Rolls Royce of walls.”\nWe brought in border security.  We brought in the Border Patrols.  We went over there — I said, “Give me yours A-list.  I want every single thing, so when I build it, I build it right.”  What do I know about building walls?  And they gave me every single thing.  And I got every single thing, from the height; to the vision through; to the type of steel that can’t be cut easily; to the type of concrete — 5,000 pound, very strong concrete; to the type of rebar; to the anti-climb provision that we have on top.  Anti-climb.  Who knows about anti-climb provision?\nAnd we built and we’re building a wall, and it is going up rapidly.  And that is tough because I built it against every single Democrat who, four years ago, wanted it.  And the only reason they don’t want it now is because I want it.  (Laughter and applause.)  It’s the only reason.  Only one reason.\nAnd I said — you know, I said this the other day, first time — I said, “I can’t believe it took me so long to figure this one out.”  If I would have said, “I do not want the wall.  I will not build the wall,” they would have insisted on the wall.  (Laughter.)   It would have been so much easier.  It would have been so much easier.  Oh, Dana, it would have gone up so fast.\nBut I took money from here and there and here and military, because it is national security, okay?  How about these people that said it was not national — when drugs are pouring in — human trafficking — women, mostly women — human trafficking — and children, but mostly women.  And it’s going up really fast.\nAnd, by the way, it is pretty much financed.  It’s really financed.  And we may get some more.  If we get some additional financing, we will extend it a little bit.  But we should have — by the end of next year, we should have anywhere from 400 to 500 miles of wall built in the most important areas.  That’s exactly what we need.  (Applause.)\nTo protect national security, we’re fully rebuilding and, for the most part, have fully rebuilt our military.  (Applause.)  Because, as I say and I have said tonight, my first duty as President is the defense of our nation.\nAs a candidate, I promised to make fundamental changes to our foreign policy after years of deadly debacles and blunders under previous administrations.  It has been pretty bad out there.  We have the greatest soldiers in the world, but they had equipment that was depleted.  It was old.  We had jets that didn’t fly — 50 percent of our jets didn’t fly.  They’d go to the plane graveyards out in the deserts, and they’d take parts because they didn’t make the parts anymore.\nAnd we’ve now spent — think of this — $8 trillion in the Middle East.  Thousands of American soldiers have lost their lives and tens of thousands more have been severely wounded.  And the hardest thing I have to do as President — single hardest thing, by far — is sending letters to the families of our fallen heroes.  It’s is the worst — they come in with letters — three, four, five.  And sometimes, I’ll call the parents.  It’s the hardest thing I have been do.\nAnd sometimes, I go to Dover and I’ll see the big, big incredible machines come in — the cargo planes.  And I’ll see them take those coffins off those planes.  And I will see parents, and sisters, and wives, and brothers — families.  I’ll see families that — I’ll meet them inside, and they will seem fine, sometimes.  And I will say to the people that do it — they greet the dead.  That’s what they say — they greet the dead.  They greet our heroes.\nBut I’ll say to the people that do that — they’re so professional.  That’s what they do.  That’s what they do every day.  That’s what they do.  So professional.  “Sir, you will stand here.  You will then hear the drums.  You will then hear the horns.  You will this, you will that.”  It’s like —\nBut I’ll go — Dover Air Force Base.  And I’ll see the parents and the wives and the husbands and whoever it may be.  And oftentimes, I’ll say to the colonel who’s in charge, “Colonel, they’re doing great.”  “No, sir.  They’re not.”  I said, “No, I think they’re really doing great.  I had a great talk with them.  They — they really are strong.  It’s amazing.”  “Sir, they — they won’t do great.”\nI say, “What do you mean?”  “You’ll see in 20 minutes when the plane pulls up and the door opens up.”  That big, huge cargo door that’s as big as this — much bigger than the back wall here.  “When you see that, sir, it’s rare that bad things don’t happen for those families.  It’s rare.”\nI said, “All right.”  This is my first time, when I first came into office.  And that big plane pulled up, and I had just spoken with the families.  But that big plane pulled up.  It’s beautiful in its strength and power.  And it pulled up, just arrived, and pulled — and it’s sort of — we’re all standing there — everybody, the military.  And I’m with generals and some Cabinet members, and the families are over here.\nAnd that tremendous door in the back, where they roll up the tanks and they roll up like unlimited amounts of equipment and weight — you wouldn’t believe it is possible to fly with all of the things — you know, the power of those planes.\nAnd that door came down, and there’s five soldiers on each side — beautiful soldiers, beautiful — and a coffin with a flag on it.  And the same people — the same exact people that, 20 minutes ago, I was saying to the colonel, “Oh, they’re doing great.  But he was right.  And that door opened, and you would hear screams and cries like you’ve never heard before, actually.  Like we’ve never heard — like I’ve never heard before.\nAnd the colonel explained to me, sometimes you’ll see a mother or a wife — sometimes, he said, you’ll see a sister break the line, break through the military, and run to the coffin and jump on top, as these incredible, strong, beautiful soldiers are carrying this coffin.  Jump — and jump on top of the coffin.  Just like, devastated.  And they move as though nothing has happened.  They just keep moving.\nAnd they take the body to where it’s going.  They place it in the hearse and it goes away.  But I tell you, I’ve never seen — you think this is easy.\nAnd we’ve been in these wars now — one of them, 19 years.  And they did not fight to win; they fight to just stay there.  And, in Syria, we were supposed to be there for 30 days, and we’ve been there for 10 years.  And, these wars, they never end.  And we have to bring our great soldiers back from the never-ending wars.\nI see — the other day I went — Friday, I went to Walter Reed Medical Center, the hospital.  First of all, those doctors are incredible, what they can do.  But I gave out Purple Hearts.  And I see — in this case, young men — all men.  And they have been just decimated.  They step on a bomb — I mean, what’s done to them is just incredible.\nSo, I see this.  And I — you know, it’s — it’s a very hard thing to do.  It doesn’t mean we won’t fight.  We’ll fight — we’re fighting harder than anybody.  But sometimes we have to know what we’re fighting for.  And we can’t stay there forever.  We have to bring our great heroes, our great soldiers — we have to bring them home.  It’s time.  It’s time.  (Applause.)\nAnd you know, in the case of Turkey and the Kurds — I could go into a whole story because I understand it, I think, better than most.  But the Kurds were going to fight the Iraqis about a year and a half ago.  Remember?  And everybody said, “We have to fight with the Kurds.  We have to fight…”\nAnd I said, “Well, wait a minute.  We just spent $4 trillion on Iraq.  Now, we’re going to fight with the Kurds against Iraq?  I’m not going to do it.”  This was in a different part of Syria — totally different.  They said, “Well, the Kurds are going to fight, and they’re going to fight.  It’s going to be a horrible war.”  “Well,” I said, “so we just spent $4 trillion fighting with Iraq,” which, by the way, was the single worst mistake this country has ever made, going into the Middle East.  Okay?  (Applause.)  We’re in there now for $8 trillion, thousands of our lives, and millions of lives on the other side, by the way.  Millions.  We’re talking about millions and millions of lives.\nBut I said, “We’re going to stand by.  We’re not going to choose sides.  They’ll have to go at it.  Let’s see what happens.”  The Kurds left.  They left.  And there was very little combat.  And it was a great decision.  We could have stayed and fought — fight the people that we’d been fighting for, whether right or wrong.  And we left, and we watched, and nothing happened.\nAnd people forget.  Most people don’t even know what I’m talking about because it was a year and a half ago.  And, even at the time — and nobody got credit for that correct decision.  And now I’m sort of an island of one again, but now it may be happening again.  That 30 kilometers — about 22 miles strip along Turkey — and the Kurds are tending to leave and that’s good.  Let them have their borders.\nBut I don’t think our soldiers should be there for the next 50 years guarding a border between Turkey and Syria when we can’t guard our own borders at home.  I don’t think so.  (Applause.)\nSo let’s see what happens.  And it’s a long ways away.  We killed ISIS.  We defeated — we did our job.  We have to go home.  We did our job.  (Applause.)\nYou know the story: I went over to Iraq and they said, “We can do it, sir.”  They told me it was going to take a year to two years — my Washington generals.  Highly overrated.  He said, “It’s going to take one year to two years.”  I said, “Man, that’s a long time.”\nRemember I wanted to pull out, Dana?  It was 97 percent.  I wanted to go.  I said, “That’s enough.  Let’s get out.”  I got — you wouldn’t believe — the military industrial complex came down on me.  So I wanted to get 100 percent.  But it would take a year to two years.  And then I went over and I met with the generals.  I said, “So, Generals…”  And these guys are like, I’m telling you, central casting.  Like better than anybody in Hollywood.  There’s nobody that looks like this in Hollywood.  I said a couple of them looked better than Tom Cruise.  They are just tougher and taller.  (Laughter.)  Better than Tom Cruise.\nBut I said, “So, General, let me ask you the big question.  Let me ask you.  They said it’s going to take a year, maybe two.  How long will it take you?”  “Two weeks, sir.”  “What do you mean, two weeks?”  “You can do it in two weeks, maybe a month — but two weeks, sir.” “How do you do that?  And why are they saying that you can do it in so much longer?”  And he said, “Sir, two weeks.  We’re going to hit them in the left.  We’re going to hit them on in the right.  We’re going to hit them underground, overground, this way, that way.  They would never let us fight.”  But I said, “But I will.”  (Applause.)\nAnd they went in — and they did.  They hit them on the left, they hit them on the right.  They hit them down the middle.  And within three weeks after I gave them the go-ahead, ISIS — we had 100 percent of ISIS.  And we captured a lot.  A lot were killed.  They’re fighters.  They don’t do big white flag things, you know.  A lot of people said, “Maybe they’ll give up.”  And the General said, “No, they won’t, sir.  They don’t give up.”  It’s an ideology.  And it, you know, a tough ideology.\nBut we did it very quickly.  And so we — we did what we should have done.  Most of these fighters came from Europe.  They came from Germany.  They came from France.  They came from many countries in Europe.  And I called them.  I said, “You got to take back your fighters.”  They said, “Nope, we don’t want them.”  And I said, “You don’t understand.  We’re not going to take the fighters.  We don’t want them.  We’re not bringing them to Guantanamo.  We’re not bringing them to our prisons in the United States.”  They come from France.  They come from Germany.  In many cases, they’re citizens.  They left to fight.  “We don’t want them back.”\nI called them again.  I said, “You have to take them back or I’m going to let them go right on your damn border.”  (Laughter.)  But they wouldn’t do it.  They wouldn’t do it.  They didn’t want them back.  We have thousands of them.  We had some really bad ones.\nThe “Beatles” — you know the Beatles?  They’re the ones with the chopped off heads?  And do you know what we did?  The night that the war — that the shooting started, we had some incredible people go into that prison, and grab them, and bring them out, and we have them totally under wraps.  They were the worst of everyone.  And we’ve got them now.  They are ours.  (Applause.)\nBut people don’t treat us right.  We did them a big favor.  We captured these people.  And I just want you to know that, because there’s a big story to this; it’s not just what these people say.\nAnd, by the way, if I did the opposite, if I had stayed and fought — we could have stayed and we could have fought, and we would have knocked Turkey around.  And we would — they would have hated it.  If I get out, they hate it.  No matter what we do, they’re going to hate it.  Okay?  No matter what decision we made — and if I’m right, and if the Kurds do back up —\nAnd we hope they do.  I hope they do.  Because it’s very hard to beat to a force where they have planes, and they don’t; where they have weapons that the Kurds don’t have.  We’ve paid a lot of money to the Kurds over the years.  And don’t forget, they’re fighting for their land.  They haven’t helped us fighting for our land.  They’re fighting for their land and that’s good, but we’ve helped them.\nBut no matter what we did, the media will say it’s the wrong decision.  I see it.  It makes no difference.  If I said, “We’re going to stay and fight.  We’re going to fight them like they never saw,” they’ll say, “It’s terrible.  I told you he loves war.”\nDon’t forget, when I got elected, everybody thought that I’d be in, Dana, World War Three the first day, right?  Now they say, “Not only aren’t we, but we have the strongest economy in the history of our country.”  You know, it’s pretty good.  (Applause.)\nAnd just so you know, wars and economies don’t go well together, okay?  You can check that out.  So despite all of the blood that was spilled, the lives lost, and the money that was spent, the Middle East is right now — remember, and I say it.  I’ll say it: Going in was the worst decision.  They went in for weapons of mass destruction, and there were none.  There were none.  That was the intelligence agencies.  They’re real — real beauties.\nIt’s less safe now.  It’s less secure, less stable, and they fight.  That is what they do; they fight.  The generals came to me in Afghanistan.  “Sir, it will be a rough spring.”  “Why?”  My first year.  “Why?”\n“Well, sir, the Taliban is going to come out of the mountains and they’re going to start fighting.”  I said, “But why do you say ‘rough.’”  “Well, that’s what they do.  They’ve done this for 1,000 years.  They come out in spring; they fight.  That’s what they do.  They’re very good.  They’re good fighters.  That’s what they do.”\nYou know, Tony wants to go watch a football game.  I want to go do things.  They want to come out and fight.  That’s what they do.  Right, Tony?  (Laughter.)  They’re probably a little bit tougher than Tony, but that’s okay.  (Applause.)  Just ask Russia if they’re tough.\nWe can beat anybody.  We can beat them easy.  We’re not fighting; we’re policing in Afghanistan.  But we’ve been there 19 years.\nSo I just want you to understand these things.  We’ve to bring people back home.  We’re rebuilding our country.  We’re rebuilding our military.  We don’t want it depleted as fast as we build it.  We have other problems.  You have Russia.  You have China.  You have other big problems.\nI think we’ll get along great with China.  I think we’ll get along great with Russia.  But when they create a phony Russia hoax, it makes it tougher to get along with Russia.  When they create lots of different scenarios with China, it makes it tougher to get along with China.  I think we will do great, but they got to let us run our country the way it is supposed to be run.  (Applause.)\nSo, these never-ending wars have increased, not decreased.  And the grave danger posed to historic Christian communities has been incredible.  Since the United States went to war in Iraq — now, listen to this.  I was against going to the war.  Nobody cared; I was a civilian.  But I got a lot of publicity for whatever reason.\nThey always liked me, or hated me.  No, I used to get the greatest publicity on Earth.  That’s how I’m here.  Once I announced I was going to run, they killed me.  And then when I won — I said, “You know, great thing…”  I told my wife, the First Lady — she’s doing a great job.  She’s doing a great job.  (Applause.)  She really is.  Man, (inaudible).  If she were married to a liberal Democrat, they would say she may be the greatest in our world, but she’s married to me.  (Laughter.)\nBut, you know, the first day — I won.  It was historic.  People didn’t think — although a lot of — there were three polls that said we were going to win.  I thought we were going to win because of the crowds we were getting, just like we got last night in Louisiana.  Let’s see what happens with that governor’s race.  (Applause.)\nJust like we got in a blue area of Minnesota.  I think we’re going to win Minnesota.  (Applause.)  Group from Minnesota.  Twenty-two thousand seats — it was like Madison Square Garden plus 1,000 seats.  The Timberwolves arena, and — where they play the NBA games.  And it was packed.  And we could have sold it out four times.  So some things happened.\nBut I said, “Well, we won.”  You know, the great thing is — because the press was so dishonest during the campaign.  So — like unbelievably.  I said, “You know, do you know the great thing?”  I told it to my wife.  I said, “Now, they’re going to respect what we did.  I’m going to get the great publicity for a while, like I used to get my whole life.”  (Laughter.)  And it got worse.  It’s worse.  It’s not even close.  It is worse now than ever.  But that is okay, because, as I said to Time magazine, “We’re here, and you’re not.”  (Applause.)\nSo, since the United States went to war in Iraq in 2003, the Christian community in the country has decreased by 80 percent, from roughly 1.5 million people to, right now, just 250,000 Christians in Iraq.  You don’t hear that.\nMy administration is absolutely committed to protecting religious minorities in the Middle East and all around the world.  You know, if you were — (applause) — if you were a Christian in Syria, which was a rough place to be, you had almost no chance, during the last administration, of coming into the United States.  It was, they say, the hardest thing to do to come into the United States — number-one most difficult place in the world to come in was if you were a Christian in Syria.  If you were a Muslim in Syria, it was extremely easy to come into the United States.  And the Christians were persecuted in Syria.  And that’s the way it is.  But it’s not that way anymore.  (Applause.)\nThis week, I directed $50 million to support Christians and other religious minorities in Syria.  I did it on Friday — $50 million.  I’ll make it in honor of Pastor Brunson, Tony, Dana — some people that have done a great job for us.  Fifty million dollars, and that’s going to help Christians in Syria.  Not an easy situation for them.\nIn total, my administration has provided more than a half a billion dollars in support of religious minorities and others suffering from atrocities in Syria and Iraq alone.  Other Presidents would not be doing that.  They’d be spending a lot more money, but they’d be spending it on things that would not make you very happy.\nWith one clear voice, the United States of America condemns the persecution of Christians.  (Applause.)  And we pledge our support to Christian communities everywhere suffering under the brutal heel of oppression and violence.  Our hearts and our souls are joined with these brave believers in their religious struggle.  And, Pastor, it’s great to have you back here.  (Applause.)\nI’ve made clear to Turkey that if they do not meet their commitments, including the protection of religious minorities and also watching over the ISIS prisoners that we captured, we will impose a very swift, strong, and severe economic sanctions, like I did with respect to my negotiations to get Pastor Brunson out.  Otherwise, I hate to say this, Pastor, you’d still be there.  And I hate to say this also, and this isn’t done from ego: Any other President in the United States, you would still be there.  You know what we had to do.  And I have to say you were very brave the way you put up with it, but it wasn’t an easy situation.\nAny military engagement where we send young men and women to fight and die must have clear objectives, vital national interests, and a realistic plan for how the conflict will end.  We don’t want to be in 19-year wars where we serve as a policing agent for the whole country.\nWe will continue our fight against the vile menace of radical Islamic terrorism.  (Applause.)  A lot of people don’t want me to use that term.  “President, don’t use that term.”  I said, “But it’s the truth.”  I don’t want to use that term, but it’s the truth.\nAnd we will never tire or waver in our defense of religious liberty.  A few weeks ago, I was honored to be the first President to host a meeting at the United Nations to call upon all nations to end religious persecution.  Can you imagine?  The first President.  (Applause.)\nThe first President that did that — and can you imagine that?  You would have thought that would be done every year for 40 years, wouldn’t you?  First President.  And I read that, and it became a big story.  And I said, “Can you believe that’s the first President that said we want to put an end to religious persecution?”  How can that be the first President?  It’s been there a long time, but that’s the way it is.\nEarlier this year, I appointed a special envoy to monitor and combat the poison of anti-Semitism.  Unfortunately, the Democrat party has invited anti-Semitism into its own ranks.  Look at Omar.  Look at her.  Have you seen what she says — not only about our country, but look at what she says about Israel.  And they’re always making excuses.  “Well, she didn’t mean it.”  She didn’t mean it?  Oh, she meant it.  She meant it much more so than even her words.\nMy administration is confronting this scourge, and we’re standing with our close friend and partner, the State of Israel.  (Applause.)  And as you know very well, I recognized the eternal capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.  (Applause.)  Thank you.\nAnd we did it for the right price.  Right, Tony?  We got the building opened.  You know, it’s an interesting story.  Some of you have heard it.  We have a great ambassador, David Friedman.  But — great lawyers.  He’s one of the top lawyers in New York — made a lot of money.  And he wanted to be the ambassador.  But he wanted it and everybody wanted it.\nAnd every President has promised that for years and years.  And they promise it.  “We’re going to recognize the capital of Israel, and we’re going to move the embassy to Jerusalem.”  But they didn’t do it.\nI understand why because, once I got into office, you have no idea the pressure that was put on.  Now, that was called a “quid pro quo.”  That was a quid pro quo.  The pressure that was put on me by so many different countries.  Calling, “Please don’t do it.  Please don’t do it.”  The last two weeks, I didn’t take anybody’s phone call.  I got calls from kings, you can imagine.  I got calls from everybody not to do it.  “Please don’t do it.”\nSo what I did is, I said, “You know what I’ll do?  I won’t take their call.  I’ll call them back in a couple of weeks.”  I said, “Do me a favor.  Tell the Prime Minister that I’ll call him back in two weeks.  I’m busy.”  (Laughter.)  He said, “Two weeks? That’s a long time.”  “Tell the king I’ll call him back in a few days.”  (Laughter.)  So, anyway — so I did it.\nAnd then I made all of those phone calls.  It had a lot of publicity.  And we did it.  It was a big story.  Nothing happened.  Remember the world was going to come to an end, right?  Nothing happened.  I kept saying, “Are we okay?”  “Yeah.”  “Is there a protest?”  “No.”\nThree or four days went by.  I said, “Well, what’s going on?  This is strange.”  But then I started making the calls.  I said, “King, what do you want?  What’s up, King?”  (Laughter.)  And he goes, “I wanted to call you to tell you that we would be very much opposed.”  And I said, “Oh, I wish I spoke to you sooner.  Sorry.”  (Laughter.)  It’s true.\nAnd everybody is happy.  Everybody is happy.  Then we had to decide on a building.  And they came in, one of the generals.  “Sir, would you please sign this order?”  I said, “What’s it for?”  “We’re going to build — start the process” — it would take 30 years, by the way — “of building the embassy.”  The actual embassy.\n“How much is it?” “One billion dollars, sir.”  I said, “Wait a minute, this is a one-story building.”  (Laughter.)  That’s what I do.  How do you spend a billion?  “Sir, we’re going to purchase land, and then we’re going to get approvals.  And we’re going to…”\nI said, “How old are we going to be by the time this thing finishes, General?”  (Laughter.)  “I don’t know, sir, but it’s $1 billion.”\nI had the name “Donald” signed.  “Donald.”  Then I said, “What is this?”  And they said — and I said — crossed it out.\nI called David Friedman.  I said, “David, go check Jerusalem.  Do we own any land?”  He said, “Let me check it out.”  He calls me back.  He goes, “Sir, we do.  We own a much better piece that the piece they want to buy.  Much better.  It’s bigger.  It’s safer.  It’s a much better location with better views.  And you know what?  We have a building on it.”  (Laughter and applause.)\nAnd he says, “Sir, I think we can renovate the building for $200,000.”  (Applause.)  True story.  And it’s the only time in my whole life that — you know, usually, I’d say, “Make it a hundred.”  I said, “David, it’s too cheap.  It doesn’t sound like enough.” I said, “Make it $500,000 or less.”\nAnd we did.  And we took this building, which was a very good building — set back.  It had all the things that you need.  They like set back, for safety.  A big site.  A beautiful site.  And I said, “Do me another favor.  Use Jerusalem stone.”  Because a friend of mine in New York has — he’s so proud.  He uses Jerusalem stone in his office.  He’s a very rich guy.  Ron Baron.  He’s got a wall of Jerusalem stone.\nEvery time I come in, he goes, “Oh, this is Jerusalem stone.”  And I say, “Ron, you’ve told me that 100 times.”  (Laughter.)   He said, “You have no idea how expensive it is.”  I said, “Listen, you’re in Jerusalem.  Can you get Jerusalem stone?”  He says, “Yeah, I can buy it real cheap.”  (Laughter.)  Comes from Jerusalem.  So they used Jerusalem stone, and we built it for less than $500,000.\nWe opened it in four months.  That is better than the Wollman Rink story — you want to really know the truth.  It’s better.  (Applause.)  So instead of a billion and a half — don’t forget, the billion was going to be $2 billion and $3 billion.  I could tell you stories.  But anyway, so we — not only did we get and do what we said I was going to do, but I got the building built and it’s been open for a year and a half.  And it’s a beautiful, beautiful embassy.  (Applause.)\nAnd maybe someday, they’ll build whatever they want to build, and they’ll have a good time, and they’ll waste a lot of money.  But we’ve got a beautiful building now that works beautifully.  And it opened up a few months — so it’s not just a designation.\nAnd we did another thing: We recognized — after 52 years of negotiation, I recognized the Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.  That was a big deal.  (Applause.)  They’d have meetings and meetings, and people would fly in.\nI withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal.  (Applause.)  And Iran is a much different country.  They are misbehaving, but they got to be very careful when they misbehave.\nAnd here in the Western Hemisphere, we’re standing against the horrors of communism and socialism — that’s what we’re fighting right here — and supporting the people of Cuba and Nicaragua and Venezuela in their noble quest for freedom.  (Applause.)  It’ll all happen.\nAnd tonight, I declare once again: America will never be a socialist country.  (Applause.)  Never, never, never, never be.  Our nation was not built by bureaucrats and regulators.  America was built by families and pilgrims and pioneers.  Our destiny is not written by people that come from areas of the world that know nothing about what we want to do.  It’s all written in our hearts.  It’s really written in our hearts.\nOur future will not be decided by the media, the bureaucrats, and the politicians.  It will be decided by all of you.  (Applause.)  That’s why we have elections.  That’s why we have elections.\nIn every generation, the faith of our people has spurred our nation to overcome every challenge to our values and to our way of life.  It has inspired us to face down the worst evils, unlock the greatest mysteries, and achieve what no one thought was ever possible.\nNow, powered by those same historic values that have always defined our nation, we will reach new heights, make new breakthroughs, and we will strengthen the bonds of love and loyalty that unite us all as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots, as Christians, as people of faith.\nAs one people, one nation, and one United States of America, we will stand as a light of liberty, a land of courage, and a home for proud people of faith.  (Applause.)\nForever and always, Americans will believe in the cause of freedom, the power of prayer, and the eternal glory of God.  Thank you.  God bless you.  And God bless America.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\nEND\n8:05 P.M.

        "text": "South LawnOctober 11, 2019\n4:45 P.M. EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So, we just made what, I guess, is one of the biggest deals that’s been made in a long time, with China.  The Vice Premier has just left my office.  We have a great deal.  We’re papering it now.  Over the next three or four or five weeks, hopefully it’ll get finished.  A tremendous benefit to our farmers, technology, and many other things — the banking industry, financial services.\nAnd, I guess, by now, you know pretty much we’ve had a very, very good couple of days with China.  And it looks like that deal is very much on it’s on way.  It’ll be the largest deal ever made for farmers.  We’re talking about a $40 [billion] to $50 billion purchase and other things.\nI mean, it’s an incredible deal for farmers.  I think they’ll have to go out and buy more land and buy bigger tractors.  So, we’ll hopefully get that done pretty quickly.\nQ    Mr. President, you have — you have been bombed today.  Our Special Forces were bombed by the Turks.  Are we going to take sanctions against the Turks?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’ll take a look at it.  We’ll take a look at it.\nQ    President Trump, sir.  Thank you, sir.  On the farmers, on that deal, is this a one-year deal or have they agreed to multi-year purchases in ag?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  This will go a long time into the future.  This a buy.  This is a very big buy.  It’s two years, but it’ll go a long time into the future.  The biggest deal made was $16 billion and this could be $50 [billion].  So this is many times more, many times bigger than any deal ever made for the farmers.\nQ    And do you expect them to keep their word this time?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Say it.\nQ    Do you trust them to keep their word this time on the purchases?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh, they’ll keep their word.  China is going to keep their word.  They want to make the deal.  They’re going to keep their word.\nQ    President Trump, is Rudy Giuliani still your personal attorney?  Is Rudy Giuliani still your personal attorney?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don’t know.  I haven’t spoken to Rudy.  I spoke to him yesterday, briefly.  He’s a very good attorney, and he has been my attorney.  Yeah, sure.\nSteve.\nQ    A question on China.  Are you prepared to take Huawei off of the entity list in a later phase?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re looking at it.  We didn’t discuss that, Steve, on this deal — Huawei.  We didn’t discuss it, having to do with phase one.  This is phase one of an either phase two or phase three deal.  So we haven’t discussed Huawei, relative to this deal.\nSo basically, the status will remain the same.\nQ    Until when?\nQ    On Maria Yovanovitch, sir.  On Maria Yovanovitch — did you put pressure to have her fire the Ambassador to Ukraine — Yovanovitch?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, she may be a wonderful woman.  I don’t know her —\nQ    Did you pressure them?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — but she may be very much a wonderful woman.  If you remember the phone call I had with the President — the new President — he didn’t speak favorably.  But I just don’t know her.  She may be a wonderful woman.\nQ    If the Chinese make lifting Huawei’s restrictions — taking Huawei off the blacklist — a condition of the phase two deal, would you consider doing that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m not going to talk about it now, because we’re just starting the negotiation of phase two.  We’ll actually begin as soon as we’re finished papering phase one.\nBut phase one, it’s one of the biggest deals ever made — and unbelievable for technology, unbelievable for the banking industry and services, and for the farmers.  It’s — there’s never been anything like it.\nQ    What do you think about Huawei?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re going to see what happens.  We’re going to be discussing that in phase two.\nQ    Do you want to fire the whistleblower?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Who?\nQ    Do you want to fire the whistleblower?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, the whistleblower has been very inaccurate.  The whistleblower — I don’t know what kind of a whistleblower —\nQ    Then why don’t you fire the whistleblower?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  The whistleblower reported a totally different conversation than I had.  I released a transcript of my conversation — an exact transcript.  And the whistleblower didn’t say that.  The whistleblower is either saying untruths, okay?  Or he didn’t know.  Or he’s making up a story, like Schiff did.  Schiff made up a story.  Because when Schiff read what I actually said, he said, “I can’t say this because he did nothing wrong.”  So Schiff went out and he made up a lie.  He made up a — it was a fraudulent story.  You know that.  You know that better than anybody.  You’re a good lawyer.\nAnd, frankly, he went out.  He made up a fraudulent story.  He then went before the U.S. Congress and the American people, and he reported a fraudulent story.  Now, Schiff — something should happen to Schiff for that.  He shouldn’t have immunity for that.  Why should Schiff be given immunity when he goes out and he says a story about the President of the United States — what the President said — and it bears no relationship?  In fact, every word was different.\nAnd I’ll tell you what: I can’t believe that a congressman could be that dishonest and can have immunity from that.\nSteve.\nQ    I just have a question about Turkey.  Are you — how serious are you about being a mediator between the Kurds and the Turks?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So, Turkey and the Kurds have been fighting for hundreds of years.  We are out of there.  But we have a tremendous financial strength, which I’ve helped a lot with, because our country has become much stronger since I’ve been President, by many trillions of dollars.  And if Turkey does something that they shouldn’t be doing, we will put on sanctions the likes of which very few countries have ever seen before.\nDavid.\nQ    Mr. President, did you or your administration pressure Fox News to get rid of Shepard Smith?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I don’t know.  Is he leaving?\nQ    He’s leaving.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh, that’s a shame.\nQ    Then why did Bill Barr meet with Rupert Murdock the other night?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That I don’t know.  Wait — did I hear Shepard Smith is leaving?\nQ    Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Is he leaving because of bad ratings?\nQ    You’d have to ask him.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Tell me.  I don’t know.  He has terrible ratings.  Is he leaving because of his ratings?\nQ    You have to ask him.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I mean, if he’s leaving, I assume he is leaving because he had bad ratings.\nQ    But you didn’t put any pressure on anybody?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He had the worst ratings on Fox, so there’s a reason — why is Shepard Smith leaving?\nQ    You’d have to ask him, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I wish him well.\nQ    The Attornery General — the Attorney General meeting with Rupert —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I wish — I wish Shepard Smith well.\nQ    Mr. President, why haven’t you asked your Justice Department to investigate Hunter Biden if he has acted so improperly?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think Hunter Biden is a disgrace.  You know, the number-one T-shirt selling right now is, “Where’s Hunter?”  I came up with that one last night.  And, by the way, we had a record-setting — last night, as you saw — rally.  That was a rally like few other rallies.\nAnd now I’m going to Louisiana.  And we’re taking the Little League World Champions — I think World Champions.  And they’re going to be on the plane.  They’re from Louisiana.  And they’re flying with me.  We just had pictures in the White House.\nQ    Will you ask your Justice Department to investigate Hunter Biden then?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I haven’t asked that, no.  But a lot of people should be asking, perhaps.  I have not asked it.\nHunter Biden walked away with a billion and a half dollars from China, $168,000 a month from Ukraine — supposedly a $3 million payment from Ukraine.  Have I asked?  No.  But I can’t imagine that somebody isn’t asking.\nQ    President Trump, your letter to Nancy Pelosi does not seem to be working.  Many people are testifying.  Do you need a new legal strategy?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  The whole thing that they’re doing is a hoax to try and win an election that they’re not going to win in 2020.  You look at the phone conversation I had with the President of Ukraine; it was perfect.  The only thing that wasn’t perfect was the fraud that was committed on the American people in Congress when Schiff got up.  And instead of reading what was said, word-for-word, exact — when Schiff got up and he lied and he defrauded the American public by making up a conversation.  He made it up.\nSo let me just tell you that the whole — this whole Ukraine story is a hoax.  And yesterday — I know you don’t like to report it, but I might as well say it: The President of Ukraine said loud and clear that the conversation was absolutely a perfect conversation, that there was no problem with it whatsoever.\nQ    Mr. President, on Turkey, one detail — on Turkey, sir.  You’ve said many times the sanctions could kick in if Turkey does something they shouldn’t do.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  The what?\nQ    What is the red line Turkey should not cross to avoid sanctions?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’ll see.\nQ    Like what?  An example.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’ll see.  We have a good relationship with Turkey.  They’re a NATO partner.  We do a lot of trade with Turkey.  But we don’t want them killing a lot of people.  And, you know, we have been out of there.  We beat ISIS.  We knocked the hell out of them.  We took a hundred percent of the caliphate.  We did our job.\nBut we have a lot of power, financially.  And I’ve built something here.  Over the last three and a half years, if you take a look — take a look at what’s been happening to the United States over the last almost three years.  You take a look at the economic power that we’ve created.  We’ve gone up — in fact, the Vice Premier of China just said — we’ve gone up trillions of dollars.  China has gone down trillions of dollars.  If we have to use sanctions, we will on Turkey.\nQ    Mr. President, why are you sending more troops to Saudi Arabia when you just said it’s a mistake to be in the Middle East?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So we’re sending more troops to Saudi Arabia.  Saudi Arabia is a very good ally, from the standpoint that we get along with them very well — a very important player in the Middle East.  The relationship has been very good.  And they buy hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of merchandise from us, not only military equipment.  In military equipment, about $110 billion.  It’s millions of jobs.\nNow, with that being said, we are sending troops and other things to the Middle East to help Saudi Arabia.  But are you ready?  Saudi Arabia, at my request, has agreed to pay us for everything we’re doing.  That’s a first.\nBut Saudi Arabia — and other countries, too, now — but Saudi Arabia has agreed to pay us for everything we’re doing to help them.  And we appreciate that.\nQ    Mr. President, about your tax returns.  You lost in court today about your tax returns —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s all right.\nQ    If Pelosi starts impeachment, will you still object?\nQ    Three court losses today.  Any —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Say it?\nQ    Three court losses today.  Any reaction to that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  What?\nQ    On immigration and taxes, turning over your taxes to —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We lost immigration?  I haven’t heard that.  We’ll win.  We’ll turn — we’ll — you know how many cases I’ve lost and then we win?\nOkay, remember they said I lost ban — the travel ban?  And then they said I lost it again, and then I ended up winning it.  So, I’ve — I’ve had a great — I’ve had a great track record.  And right now, within a couple of weeks, we will have 160 judges.  And within a couple of months, we’ll have 182 federal judges.  And we are breaking records like nobody has ever seen in that regard, as you know.\nQ    Do you support administration officials —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Do you agree?  Do you agree?  A hundred and eighty-two.  Do you agree?\nQ    Do you support administration officials —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You got to say yes.\nQ    — testifying under subpoena?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Your father would say yes.\nQ    You agreed to hold off on the tariff increase next week, correct?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’re going to hold off on the 5 percent increase from 25 to 30 [percent].\nQ    And what specific concessions did you get from the Chinese in exchange for that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, if you look at the deal, the deal is so incredible.  The deal is a great deal.  And I have to say it again: The farmers — it’s going to be $50 billion dollars’ worth of purchase.  The most they’ve ever done was $16 [billion].  So the farmers in Iowa, Nebraska, and all of these other great states that I love and that obviously like me a lot, too, they’re going to have to buy more land fast and bigger tractors or they’re not going to be able to keep up with the order.\nAlso, China, over the last two weeks, as you’ve probably seen, has been buying a lot of farm product.  A lot of farm product.\nSo, we’re agreeing not to put that additional increase.  So we’re going to get 25 percent.  And when the increase kicks in on October 15th, on the 25 to 30 [percent], we’re not going to charge that.  That’s going to be held in abeyance, subject to the final deal.\nQ    Any other concessions from the Chinese, other than agriculture?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, it’s basically everything I said.  I don’t have to go through it.  But tremendous for banking, tremendous for technology.  Beyond tremendous for the American farmer and rancher.  Tremendous deal.\nHave a good time.  See you in Louisiana.  We’re going — we’re going now — we’re going now to Louisiana.  We’re going to have a great rally.  I hope you’re going to come.  Okay?\nEND\n4:59 P.M.

        "text": "Oval Office3:36 P.M. EDT\nPresident Trump and Vice Premier Liu He of China\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, thank you very much.  We’ve had a lot of very big news and some very good news today.  But I’d like to hold this for China.  There’s nothing bigger than what we’re doing with China.  I think it’s important that these are the questions that are asked.  And, as you know, we have the Vice Premier of China, one of the most respected men in all of China, and the world, for that matter.  And we have great respect for him, a great friendship with him.\nAnd we’ve come to a very substantial phase one deal, and I’ll go through some of the points, and then I’ll ask the Vice Premier to say a few words and any comments that he may have.\nWe have come to a deal, pretty much, subject to getting it written.  It’ll take probably three weeks, four weeks, or five weeks.  As you know, we’re going to be in Chile together for a big summit.  And maybe it’ll be then, or maybe it’ll be sometime around then.\nBut we’ve come to a deal on intellectual property, financial services.  A tremendous deal for the farmers.  A purchase of — from 40 to 50 billion dollars’ worth of agricultural products.  To show you how big that is, that would be two and a half, three times what China had purchased at its highest point thus far.  So, they were purchasing $16 or $17 billion at the highest point, and that’ll be brought up to $40 billion to $50 billion.  So I’d suggest the farmers have to go and immediately buy more land and get bigger tractors.  They’ll be available at John Deere and a lot of other great distributors.\nBut we’re taking the purchase of agricultural products from $40 to $50 billion, meaning in that neighborhood — from 40 to 50, approximately, billion.  And what they’ve been doing now, I believe, is about $8 billion, right?  Eight — right now it’s eight.\nThe other thing I will say is, over the last two weeks, a lot of purchases have started going back to our farmers.  And you’ve been doing a lot of business with us, which we appreciate very much.  But it really started a few weeks ago, but they intend to go up, ultimately, once the agreement is signed, from $40 to $50 billion.  And, really, from — that was from a base of probably $16 billion, and right now it’s $8 billion.  And the $8 billion was lower than $8 billion.  They got up to $8 billion because they’ve been purchasing quite a bit over the last couple of weeks.\nSo, we also have the agricultural structural issues.  We have some incredible progress on the structure and structural issues.  And, Bob, perhaps you could discuss that, please, on agriculture, and explain the importance of the structural issues that we’ve solved.\nAMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER:  Well, I would say probably at least as important as the purchases is the fact that we’ve corrected a variety of SPS — what we call sanitary and phytosanitary issues.  And we’ve corrected biotechnology issues.  And it will be — it will be much easier now for American farmers to be able to ship to China.  And we’ve made some corrections on our side to — that will help them on the Chinese side.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And that’s been completed and pretty much done.\nAMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER:  That’s correct.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Another big issue that we’ve come to conclusion on is currency, foreign exchange.  And, Steve, do you want to explain that, please?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Well, we’ve had very good discussions with Governor Yi, head of the People’s Bank of China — their central bank.  We’ve also had extensive discussions on financial services, opening up their markets to our financial services firms.  So that we have pretty much almost a complete agreement on both those issues.  And as you know, Mr. President, currency has been a very big concern of yours since the campaign.  And we have an agreement around transparency into the foreign exchange markets and free markets.  So we’re very pleased with that.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  We’ve also made very good progress on technology transfer, and we’ll put some of technology transfer in phase one.  Phase two will start negotiations almost immediately after we’ve concluded phase one and papered it.  And I think phase one should happen pretty quickly.\nSo you have intellectual property.  We have an agreement on intellectual property.  Financial services — the banks and all of the financial services companies will be very, very happy with what we’ve been able to get.  And I think China is going to be very happy because they’ll be served very well by these great institutions being able to go into China.  And it’s going to be a tremendous thing for banks and for financial service companies.\nAgricultural structural issues — tremendous for the farmers.  As Steve said, that’s almost as good as — which I disagree with him on that, but it’s almost as good as going from $8 billion and then to $16 billion, which was their all-time high, to $40 to $50 billion.  So we’re going to be up to 40 to 50 billion dollars of agricultural purchases, which means the farmers are going to have to work a lot of overtime to produce that much.  That’s the largest order in the history of agriculture, by far, by two and a half times.\nAnd technology transfer — we’ll have some technology transfer in the agreement, but technology transfer will largely be done here and also in phase two.  So we’re going to start negotiating phase two after phase one is completed and signed.  And then there may be a phase three or we may get it done in phase two.  So you’ll either have two phases or three phases.\nSo we’re very happy with it.  We have great respect for China, great respect for President Xi.  And I want to just tell you that I watched the 70th anniversary in great detail, and it was an incredible event.  And congratulations on the 70th, everyone.  That was really something very amazing to watch.\nMr. Lighthizer has done a terrific job.  All of my team, I think, has done a fantastic job.  The Vice Premier, I want to just thank you very much for being here with your team.  You’re very tough negotiators.  Congratulations.\nBut it’s something that we both realized right from the beginning is very important — not only for China and not only for the U.S., but for the world.  And every time there’s a little bad news, the market would go down incredibly.  Every time there was a little bit of good news, the market would go up incredibly.  And yet, other news that was also very big, the market just didn’t really care.  They just seemed to care about the deal with USA and China, and that’s okay with me.\nSo we’ve had a tremendous, really, negotiation, a very complex negotiation, but something that’s going to be great for both countries.\nAnd, Mr. Vice Premier, would you like to say something?\nVICE PREMIER LIU:  (As interpreted.)  First, on behalf of the Chinese government, we would like to extend our thanks to President Trump for your congratulatory message to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.\nWe very much agree that to get the China-U.S. economic relationship right, it’s something that is good for China, for the United States, and for the whole world, and we are making a lot of progress towards a positive direction.\nOver the recent days, I have had very good communication with both Ambassador Lighthizer and Secretary Mnuchin.  And, Mr. President, as you just mentioned, we have made substantial progress in many fields.  We are happy about it.  We’ll continue to make efforts.\nAnd thank you for this opportunity for me to speak up.  And all my colleagues are happy about it.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, thank you very much.  And it’s a great honor.  I think that the currency, foreign-exchange agreement that we made will be a tremendous — of tremendous benefit, both in terms of the magnitude of it and in terms of the simplicity of what we’re able to do.  It’ll make a very complicated process much simpler.  I think that, in itself, I just see as something that we both have been working for.\nYes, please.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:  (Inaudible) read later to you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, thank you very much.  Could I see that?  That would be very nice.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:  Well, of course.  Of course.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  That would be very nice.  That’s very nice.\n(The Vice Premier presents President Trump with a document.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:  (Inaudible.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes.  Oh.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:  (Inaudible.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes.  That’s — this is for guys like Jon that can’t — that aren’t good with Chinese.\nThey’ll have that magnified so fast your head will spin.\nWell, it’s a tremendous message, and thank you very much.  And I’ve read this, and I appreciate it very much.  This is from President Xi.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:  Yes.  (Inaudible.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And we knew that we were going to have a very successful phase one.  And it took us a long time to get here, but it’s something that’s going to be great for China and great for the USA, and we appreciate it very much.  And please congratulate President Xi.  Thank you very much.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:  Thank you.  Thank you.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Mr. President, I just want to clarify on the tariffs —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Please.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:  So, I was just going to clarify, the Vice Premier has requested, and the President has approved, while we go through a process of documenting this, we will not be implementing the increase of tariffs that were scheduled to go in place from 25 to 30 percent.\nQ    The ones that were supposed to go into place on Tuesday of next week, is that right?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:  That’s correct.  That’s correct.  Those will be confirmed while we —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Including the other ones.\nQ    Mr. President, are we not closer to a complete end of this trade war?  (Inaudible.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, I think we’re very close.  I think this is a very important phase.  A lot of things are — our agriculture will be completed because, when we bring it up to $50 billion — I project is going to be the number — I don’t know if there’s a question as to whether or not our farmers can produce that much.  And I think they can, but they’re literally — and I said it jokingly, and I think I mean it — they’re going to have to buy more land, which is okay.  It would be a good time to own land in Iowa, Nebraska, and a lot of other great states.  So, they’re very happy about it.\nBut we’re taking it from $8 billion, which it is now — and it was about $2 or $3 billion; they got down pretty low.  But if you take — the highest it ever was was $16 billion, and we’re bringing that to $50 billion.  So we’re going from 16 to 50 — so anywhere between 40 and 50.  And that’ll start very soon.  And they’ve actually already started purchasing.  You’ve actually started purchasing a lot —\nVICE PREMIER LIU:  Yes, yes.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  — from the farmers.  We just got messages from the Midwest.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:  We have already, what?\nPARTICIPANT:  Twenty million.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:  Twenty million tons.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  You have 20 billion?\nINTERPRETER:  Twenty million.  Twenty million tons of soybeans.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Oh, 20 million tons.\nPARTICIPANT:  Of soybeans.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:  Already.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, a tremendous amount of soybeans.  And that was over the last couple of weeks.  We got word of that.  You know, we got word.  We notice it; it goes quickly — because we see a price go up a little bit, right?  It’s incredible the way the market works.  But, yes —\nVICE PREMIER LIU:  About 398 dollars.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  That’s right.  That’s right.\nQ    How will this deal be enforced, Mr. President?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  We’re working on enforcement right now, and that’s been largely agreed to, and that’s one of the things in this agreement.  We have an enforcement provision.  And they’re working out the final aspects of that enforcement position, and I think that’s something — Bob, do you want to say something about that?\nAMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER:  Sure.  So, we’re going to have a very elaborate consultation process.  We have an escalation in various areas so that difficulties can be resolved.  Both parties have allocated — or have assigned various people; have created a structure under it.  And we’re down to the final details of what will happen if there’s not a resolution.  And that’s, kind of, the final issue that we’re putting together.\nBut both sides agree it absolutely has to have it, a workable dispute settlement mechanism.  And we’re very close to that.\nQ    Mr. President, how do you see the U.S.-China relations right now?  Do you see — what kind — what areas U.S. and China can still work together?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, I think they’re great.  I think the relationship, in certain ways, may be better than it’s ever been.  We’ve been through a very tough negotiation.  There’s never been a negotiation like this.  In all fairness, I give China tremendous credit because, for 25 or 30 years, they’ve done very well with the U.S., and now we’re doing something jointly.  We’re doing it in a fair manner.\nI give China credit for what they’ve done over the last 30 years.  Tremendous credit.  I don’t blame China; I blame the people representing our country.  Now we have a deal that I think ultimately is going to be just fantastic for China and fantastic for the United States.\nQ    Mr. President, can you clarify: Is this an actual deal or is this progress towards a deal?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, it’s subject to getting everything papered.  You have to do it — we’ve agreed in principle to just about everything I mentioned, all of the different points.  And now we’re getting it papered, and I don’t think it should be a problem getting it papered.  I think that China wants it badly, and so we want it also.  And we should be able to get that done over the next four weeks.  We’re going to be in Chile in five weeks, so we’ll see, in terms of signing, when it happens.  We’ll do a formal signing with President Xi and myself.\nBut this is just something that’s very exciting.  And I’m very excited, actually.  We cover a lot more territory than agriculture, but I’m very excited for the farmer because this is — there’s never been a deal of this magnitude for the American farmer.\nQ    On Huawei?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Bob, do you want to talk about the Huawei?\nQ    Is Huawei in the deal, Ambassador Lighthizer?\nQ    Or Secretary Ross?\nAMBASSSADOR LIGHTHIZER:  I’m sorry, the question is —\nQ    Huawei.\nAMBASSSADOR LIGHTHIZER:  In this agreement, we’re not dealing specifically with Huawei.  It’s not part of this agreement.  That’s a separate process.\nQ    Mr. President, have you or your advisors raised the business dealings of Hunter Biden with Chinese officials in the last week?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, we’re going to discuss where’s Hunter.  Where is Hunter, by the way?  Whatever happened to him?  We’re going to discuss where’s Hunter when I get out because I’ll stop at the helicopter.  But, right now, in respect to China and to the Vice Premier, we’re going to only ask questions about today.\nJon.\nQ    Mr. President, on that point, can you assure that American people that you did not bring up Joe Biden in these negotiations; that you have not brought up that with the Chinese?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I have not brought up Joe Biden.  China can do whatever they want with respect to the Bidens.  China can do whatever they want with respect to $1.5 billion going to somebody.  That’s up to China.  But we do have to look into corruption.  But, no, it has not been brought up.\nQ    Mr. President, how do you assure the American people that this deal, over the next three, four, five weeks, won’t fall apart as it’s being papered?  And then, secondly, that phase two can —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, anything can happen.  That can happen.  I don’t think it will.  I think we know each other very well.  We’ve been negotiating this for a long time.  There’s a possibility, of course, that maybe there’s something that they’re unable to get papered.  But I’ve been doing this for a long time.  And the Vice Premier has been doing it for a long time, in many other deals for many, many years —  both of us.\nAnd his people are very profess- — great professionals, and so am I.  And I think the likelihood of it falling apart is not so good.\nWhat do you think, Steve?  What would you say?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:  I think we have a fundamental understanding on the key issues.  We’ve gone through a significant amount of paper, but there is more work to do.  And we will not sign an agreement unless we get and can tell the President that this is on paper.  And I know the Vice Premier needs to go back and do some work with his team, but we’ve — we’ve made a lot of progress over the last two days.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And most of this is also known by the people in China, by President Xi.  He’s been following it very closely, and (inaudible).\nQ    Your teams have been working together for over a year and a half now.  Can you comment on the progress — I mean the performances of the teams, of both sides?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think — are you from China?\nQ    Yes.  China (inaudible).\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think the people of China have to be very proud of your team.  They are unrelenting.  I say that in a positive way.  But they’re unrelenting.  They’re tough.  They’re smart.  And they have negotiated a great deal.\nBut I think the people of China should be very proud of this team, starting with the Vice Premier.  He’s a very extraordinary man, and we’ve gotten to know each other well.  And everybody on my team respects your team.  So, I think they’ve really handled themselves incredibly well.\nQ    Mr. President, (inaudible) tariffs, sir — are the December tariffs also suspended as this process goes on?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So the tariffs on the increase from 25 percent to 30 percent, that will be suspended.  We’ll be paying 25, but we’re not increasing it to 30.  And then you might want to mention the additional tariff.\nAMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER:  The addition — the additional tariffs are scheduled to go into effect, as many of you know, the second half of the September.  That is scheduled into effect on December the 15th.  And the President has not made a final decision on that, but there’s plenty of time to make that decision.  And that is certainly a part of this process that the Chinese are working their way through.\nSo, the first one has been suspended.  The second one is subject to the President making a final decision.  But, the way this timing works out, that will be well in advance of that date.\nQ    Mr. President, when can students who are (inaudible) in this country —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Say it?\nQ    — that have difficul- — I mean, many Chinese students have difficulty in this country with their visas.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Students?\nQ    Yes.  Chinese students in this country.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, no, no, no, no, no.\nQ    Can you clarify to us —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’re going to be very good to Chinese students.  Nope.  I’ve heard this question many times before, including from our own security people.  We want all the people that want to come over from China.  We have the greatest university system in the world, and we’re going to keep it that way.   And one of the reasons it’s great is we have a lot of students from China.\nNo, we’re not going to make it tough.  We’re going to make it like for everybody else.  Okay?  We’re going to make it — I think that’s important.\nI think, Steve, I think it’s very important, Bob, our universities are available.  The world comes in.  They use our universities.  We have the greatest system in the world.  And China is not going to be treated any differently.\nI think it’s important for you to say that, too, to the people of China.  Our system is open.  People get in based on merit.  We have incredible talent coming in from China.  They occupy a big space in our universities, and we want to keep it that way.  Okay?\nBecause there was a false — there was false rumors going on that we were going to close the schools to China.  That is so false.  It’s just false.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:  Some Chinese (inaudible) already exchanged our opinion.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You’ve already exchanged.  Yes.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:  With (inaudible).\nQ    Mr. President, any chance of —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Wait, one second.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Mr. President, I think you’ve been very clear in your directive all along, through the trade negotiations, on your view on the universities.  And we will follow up.\nQ    Are you going to do anything to reassure the students?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  I can give them my word.  I want them coming here.  We want the greatest talent in the world coming to our great universities — to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, the great Wharton School of Finance — (laughter) — to Stanford, all of these great schools.  We want them — we want them coming here.  And that’s what we have.  And that’s one of the reasons we have the great system.\nAnd there have been discussing about that — not by me, because I ended them very quickly.  I want to let you know, I end those discussions very quickly.\nQ    (Inaudible) rescinding the currency manipulation designation?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:  We’ll be making a decision on that and evaluating it.  Although I would comment that, assuming we close the agreement and we have the assurances, that will be a big step in the right direction for our evaluation.\nQ    What about Chinese business?  Do you still welcome Chinese business to invest in the U.S.?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Absolutely we do.   We do.  We’re doing a lot of business with Chinese companies.  We do have to be — you know, security companies and certain companies — we have to be careful with and we have to pay very close attention.  But we’re doing tremendous business with China and with Chinese businesses.\nIt’s tailed off.  We’ve tailed it off.  We’ve purposefully tailed it off.  But that’ll start building up very quickly again.  We expect that to build up to a much bigger extent, I think, than even before.\nQ    When you’ve talked about a big trade deal with China, is this what you’ve envisioned?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, this is phase one, and it’s a big part of it.  The farmers, the intellectual property — a lot of — a lot of areas are covered here that, frankly, are in great shape — intellectual property.  Financial services is going to be a massive boon to the banks and credit card companies and all of these companies, including ownership interests.\nYou know, before you had to do certain things that made it very difficult for banks and institutions to really go into China.  China has really been opened up now, for the first time, to financial services and to the big banks and credit card companies and other types of financial services.  So that’s a tremendous thing.  And I think we have complete agreement on that.\nIntellectual property — a lot of agreement.  But we’ll have some of that included in phase two.\nAgriculture should be done.  I don’t think the farmers can handle any more than what they’re getting.  Don’t forget: We just signed a big deal with Japan.  And that was a very big deal.  And a lot of that had to do with agriculture also.  So the farmers are doing well.\nIn currency, foreign exchange — we’re all set on that.  That we’ve been able to do.  And not only through simplification, but the importance of it — it’s very important.\nAnd technology transfer — so we’re going to have some technology transfer here, and some will be in phase two.  We think we’ll probably be able to conclude it with phase two, but it may be phase two, phase three.  Okay?\nQ    Mr. President, how did you come around to the idea of doing a phase one?  You’ve been saying, as recently as earlier this week, that you wanted one big deal.  What changed your mind?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Because it’s such a big deal and it covers so much territory that doing it in sections and phases is, I think, really better.  And we’re talking about very big — don’t forget, we’ve covered, fully, agriculture — even in terms of agricultural structural issues, and then in terms of $50 billion of agriculture.\nSo that will be covered in its entirety.  Currency foreign exchange will be covered in entirety.  Financial services, I think, will be covered pretty much in its entirety.  So the banks and lending institutions — all institutions — are covered.\nSome of technology transfer, a large part of intellectual property will be covered.  So I think it actually works out to be a very neat package.  And now we can focus on phase two.\nQ    Mr. President, how much time are you going to allow to go by as this goes through?  So you said it might take four or five or six weeks to put it in paper.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Whatever it is.\nQ    At what point would you raise tariffs again if you don’t have a deal that you can actually sign?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, we’ll see.  Only — only good faith and faith.  And I think we have a lot of good faith right now going on.  I think we have —\nQ    So no new tariffs in the foreseeable future?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  What we’re doing is we’re going to start, Jon, right away, in getting this papered.  Right now it’s — it’s already partially papered.  Much of this has been pretty much completed, from the standpoint of paper.  But we think it’ll take four weeks, five weeks — something like that.  Now, we happen to be together in Chile.  So that could be a point, or maybe not.  President Xi will be there and I’ll be there for the big summit.\nQ    Mr. President, the last time the Vice Premier was in the Oval Office, in April, you said a deal, at that point, was about four weeks away.  I would love to hear from both of you why this time is different?  What’s changed in the relationship?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think we got to know each other a lot better.  Don’t forget, there’s been a lot of back-and-forth since that happened.  We thought we had a deal, and perhaps they didn’t, but it didn’t work out that way.  This deal is a bigger deal than the last deal, relatively speaking.  Now, we’re talking about big parts of it, with financial services and agriculture.\nBut when we talk about $50 billion in agriculture, we never had that in mind in the first deal.  We were thinking about $20 [billion].  We were thinking about anywhere from $16 [billion], I would say, to $20 billion.  Now we’re talking about $50 billion.\nSo this is actually a much bigger deal.  It’s a big chunk of it, but it’s a much bigger deal than we had in mind — certainly, in terms of — I would say, Steve — financial services is bigger and more complete.  Intellectual property will be in both phases of the deal.  Currency foreign exchange — we didn’t really discuss that very much in the last deal; now we’re including it in this deal because a lot of things have happened during the course of the last year (inaudible).  So —\nQ    I thought that was agreed in the spring.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think this is actually, when you add it up, going to be a more important deal — a bigger deal.  And more precise.\nQ    So the (inaudible) on currency had been agreed last spring as well, before talks broke down, right?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, now we have currency — the currency foreign exchange is included.  The foreign exchange aspect of it is much more complete now than it would have been under the other system.  And don’t forget, a lot of things have happened with currency and foreign exchange that we weren’t talking about a year ago.  Things have happened.\nQ    On the summit —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes.  From China.\nQ    You mentioned about the summit.  When and where would you like it to be?  And also —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, we’re going to find that out.  That’ll be up to the Vice Premier and to President Xi.  So we’ll find that out.\nQ    Okay.  On the global economic slowdown, do you think this kind of win-win will help the global economy?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, the United States has been doing very well.  China, I think, will — I think this will be a tremendously positive — this is going to be a tremendous thing for China.  We’ve been doing well and I think we’ll do better.  I mean, we’ve been doing really well.  We’ve been leading the world in many aspects of what we’re talking about.  I think we’ll do even better.  And I think China will do tremendously well with this deal.  This is a great deal for China.  It’s a great deal for us.\nQ    This $40 [billion] to $50 billion — is that an annual figure?  Will it rise to that figure?  Is that over two or three years?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Do you want to define that, please?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:  It will scale up to an annual figure.  Yes.\nQ    To an annual figure of $40 [billion] to $50 billion?\nSECRETART MNUCHIN:  Yes.\nQ    Can you say over how long, Mr. Secretary?\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Within the second year.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Over the — over the — less than two years.\nQ    Mr. President, did Hong Kong and the Uyghurs come up at all?  That’s a big issue in other parts of — on Capitol Hill, for example.  Or is that separate to trade to you?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  We discussed Hong Kong.  And I think great progress has been made by China in Hong Kong.  And I’ve been watching.  And I actually told the Vice Premier it really has toned down a lot from the initial days of a number of months ago, when I saw a lot of people.  And I see far fewer now.\nWe were discussing it, and I think that’s going to take care of itself.  I actually think this deal is a great deal for the people of Hong Kong to see what happened.  I think this is a very positive thing for Hong Kong.\nBut — but it really has — it’s — the escalation, it really has deescalated a lot from the beginning, and we were discussing that.\nQ    Would you put a stop on the blacklist of Chinese companies, which seems to be expanding these days?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, we’ll be looking at the blacklist, and we’ll be making a determination as to which companies would be on that list.\nQ    Mr. President, if this deal goes forward — helps the economy, economic growth, et cetera — do you still think that the Federal Reserve needs to cut rates?  And if so, by how much?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, I do.  I do.  I think the Federal Reserve should cut rates regardless of this deal because we’re higher than other nations.  Germany is loaning money, and when it has to be paid back, they get paid, okay?  It’s ridiculous.\nAnd I think that the Federal Reserve should cut rates regardless of how good this is.  We have a great economy, but we have a Federal Reserve that’s not in step with the rest of the world.  So I think they ought to get in step.  And if they were in step, we’d — we would — regardless of the China deal — the China deal is much more important than the interest rates, but —\nBecause this has to do with more than trade; this has to do with world peace.  This has to do with getting along.  This has to do with the rest of the world.  This isn’t just a deal on trade.  This has to do with a lot of friction, a lot of bad things that are happening in the world.\nSo, this is far more important than the Federal Reserve and interest rates.  But the Federal Reserve should cut interests rates.  Absolutely.\nQ    Did you tell them anything about the impeachment process and how that might affect your ability to complete this deal?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think it’s helped me, because yesterday we had the biggest crowd.  We broke a stadium record.  We broke the record in Minnesota.  Nobody has ever seen anything like that.  And you saw it, and you understand it, too.  And my poll numbers are going way up.  And so, the impeachment, it’s a hoax.\nNo, we didn’t discuss it, but I would tell him it’s a hoax.  It’s a hoax done by people that are losing.  And they want to try and use it to try and win an election, and I don’t think it’s going to happen.  And I don’t think China believes it’s going to happen, because if they did, they’d rather deal with a Sleepy Joe Biden, who is failing badly.  He’s not going to make it anyway.  But whoever does emerge on the other side, they’d probably be better off maybe waiting.\nBut they also know that when I win, the deal gets even tougher.  It gets even tougher.  And they expect that I’m going to win, otherwise they wouldn’t sign the deal.  It’s very simple.\nNext.\nQ    Mr. President, you’ve made clear that you like putting tariffs out.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I do like tariffs.\nQ    How are you — what’s your inclination then, about December?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think then we’re going to have a deal that’s a great deal, that’s beyond tariffs.  This is a deal that’s a very important deal for China, a very important deal for the world, a very important deal for the United States.  I think this is a deal that is beyond tariffs.\nI really mean that.  I think that world peace — you know, there was a lot of friction between the United States and China.  And now, it’s a lovefest.  That’s a good thing.  But that’s good for China and it’s good for us, but it’s good for the world.\nThe Vice Premier said the same thing.  And he said it better than anybody could have said it.  He said, “This is a great thing for the world.”  He didn’t say “China” or “us”; he said this is a great thing “for the world.”  And he’s absolutely right.\nPerhaps you’d like to comment on that.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:  Yes, I fully agree with you.  It’s good for China.  It’s good for U.S.  But it’s good — also good for the whole world.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.  The whole world is watching.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:  Yes.  Whole world is watching.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And it is amazing, and I say —\nVICE PREMIER LIU:  Not only (inaudible).\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yes.\nVICE PREMIER LIU:  Not only a treaty.  It provides peace and prosperity and development for the whole world.  I think it’s very important.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He said, “peace and prosperity… for the whole world.”\nSo, it’s beyond the trade deal.  It really is.  And, you know, talk was getting tough, rhetoric was getting tough.  We have ships and they have ships, and we have planes and they have planes.  And, you know, bad things could happen.  Stupid things could happen.  But this is a great — a great thing that’s taken place.  We have a very good bond and relationship.\nAnd I have very little doubt that we’ll be able to get this thing finalized now.  It’s not overly complex.  And then they’ll start phase two.  But this was a very important deal for a lot of reasons.\nThank you very much.  I hear a helicopter.  I hear a helicopter.\nI’m going down to Louisiana.  We have a totally sold-out crowd in Louisiana.  And hopefully the governor of Louisiana, who is not doing a very go- — you know, he’s not doing a very good job in Louisiana.  Hopefully, he won’t get the 50 percent, we’ll have a runoff, and you have a nice, new Republican governor of Louisiana.\nAnd I hope a lot of you are going to join us.  You’re joining us, Jon?  You’re going to be joining us to Louisiana?\nQ    I’ll be watching, sir.  I’ll be watching.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Did you watch last night?\nQ    Yes, yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Did you enjoy it?\nQ    You know, it’s my job to watch.  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  A lot of people enjoyed it, Jon.  Have a good time everybody.\nQ    Would you take Huawei off the blacklist, sir?  Would you take Huawei off the blacklist, possibly?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I — I — we’ll talk about that later.\nEND

        "text": "Safety SignsLakeville, Minnesota\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, hello, Minnesota!  (Applause.)  It is exciting to be here at Safety Signs.  What a dynamic, growing family-owned business and a success story.  Join me in thanking Sue and Jay Blanchard for your leadership, your commitment to this community — (applause) — and your example of the American Dream.  Come on up on the stage.  I don’t know what the — I don’t know if they paid for — come on.  (Applause.)\nThat’s great.  Great.  Come back up here, Karen.  I’ll tell you, I’m glad — I really appreciate — and the Secretary of Labor has literally been on the job for like a week.  But he is an extraordinary American and he’s going to be a great, great champion for working Americans all across this nation.  Join me in thanking Secretary Eugene Scalia one more time, will you?  The Secretary of Labor.  (Applause.)\nAnd I want to thank our host, Generra Peck.  Generra that was like the shortest trade work speech I’ve ever heard in my life.  (Laughter.)  She must know I got somewhere else to be.  (Laughter.)  But give them a round of applause.  They put together today for us.  (Applause.)  And, Generra, we appreciate you.  Great job.\nAnd it is a special delight here to be with the woman to my right.  We loaded up our two dogs and our cat — (laughter) — and headed to Minnesota today.  We’ve been married 34 years, and I’ll tell you what: She is a champion for military families.  She is a champion for art therapy all across the nation.  And I’ll tell you what: She is, I think, the greatest Second Lady this country has ever had.  Would you join me in thanking Karen Pence?  She’s just doing an incredible job.  (Applause.)  Thank you, sweetheart.\nAnd I would not correct the Secretary lightly, but he did say there’s no one who’s worked harder for the progress that this economy has made than me.  But I might have one correction. There’s somebody else who I promise you has never stopped fighting to create jobs, a more prosperous and a more secure America.  So, Minnesota, before he’s wheels down, let me bring greetings to Safety Signs from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.  (Applause.)\nYou know, I know Sue and Jay will appreciate this comment the President said not long ago: “Small-business owners embody the American pioneering spirit and remind us that determination can turn aspiration into achievement.”  And that really is the story.  That’s the story of the Blanchard family and of Safety Signs.  And these are two people who have built a great business.  I’m looking out on a lot of great employees here.  And give yourselves a round of applause.  The success of this company is owing to each and every one of you.  (Applause.)\nBut, you know, this isn’t just a great employer, it isn’t just a great small business.  It’s also a great — a great corporate citizen.  And these are — these are two great, proud graduates of St. Cloud State University.  But, in 2016, I’m actually told, they were named Lakeville Chamber of Commerce Community Business Partners of the Year for everything that they have done to improve this community — from the 9/11 Never Forget Memorial, to the VFW mobile Vietnam Wall.  And all other community organizations, thank you for making Safety Signs and your family such a part of what makes this community special.  We’re really proud of you.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Sue.  Great job.  Really great job.\nAnd I know it’s a family affair.  Jay just made the point that I grew up in a small business in southern Indiana, south of Highway 40.  We had a gas station business.  Had three brothers and two sisters, and so I know what it is to be in a family business.  So I don’t want to — I don’t want to miss mentioning your three kids: Isabel, Jake, and your oldest daughter, Karlee.  I don’t know if they’re here with us today, but give us a wave over here.  Let’s hear it for this great family.  (Applause.)  And especially Karlee, who had the good sense to graduate from Notre Dame University in Indiana.  Well done, Karlee.  (Applause.)\nI actually had the privilege of speaking at her commencement that year.  And what a great accomplishment.  I know your parents are so — so, so proud of each and every one of you.\nNow, we — we’re gathering in a place that has a motto: “Whatever it takes.”  I know you all live by that every day.  You’re working on tighter and tighter deadlines because Safety Signs is getting busier every day in this bustling economy.\nAnd I’ll tell you what: I couldn’t be more proud to serve alongside a president who, from the first day of this administration, has been working to get the economy of Minnesota moving and the economy of America moving.  And right out of the gate, we cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses just like this one, family farmers.  We rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in American history already.   And as you all see happening right here in northern Minnesota, we’ve unleashed American energy.  We have an energy revolution happening all across this nation, and the results have been amazing.  (Applause.)\nThe results have truly been amazing.  The economy — as a Secretary just told you — more than 6 million new jobs in the last three years.  Unemployment is at a 50-year low.  There’s more Americans working today than ever before.\nBut I’ll tell you what: What actually means the most to the President and me — and I’ll say this to Jay and Sue — is that wages are rising all across America in the last two years, and they’re rising most rapidly for hardworking blue-collar Americans.  The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more.  This economy is working.  (Applause.)  It’s working for working people.\nBut I came here today, with the support of this great trade work script, to tell you that, in addition, we think to let people keep more of what they earn and making sure you don’t have a lot of red tape on your business so you can grow and thrive, and making sure that — making sure that we have a pathway to energy independence has been the President’s ambition to promote trade deals that are free and fair.  And we’ve opened up new markets.  Just about two weeks ago, we signed a new trade deal with Japan where we’re going to — we’re going to export more agricultural goods to Japan than ever before.  We’ve opened up markets in South America.  We renegotiated the South Korea trade agreement.\nBut sitting on the desk of the Speaker of the House in Washington, D.C., is the largest trade deal in American history.  And I came here to Minnesota today to say the time has come for Democrats in Congress to pass the USMCA, and pass it this year.  (Applause.)\nI mean, I don’t have to tell all of you that trade means jobs here in Minnesota.  In fact, we got someone with us today who, during his time in Congress, was a great, great champion of economic growth and low taxes, and free and fair trade.  Jason Lewis, thank you so much for being with us today — you and your wonderful wife, Leigh.  (Applause.)\nBut I want to challenge each one of you because we’ve got a great opportunity in front of us.  And Washington, D.C. is spending its time on the endless investigations and controversy. But we got an opportunity to pass something in the Congress that would be a win for everyone in Minnesota and a win for this country, and that’s the USMCA.\nDid you know that Minnesota actually sends $7.2 billion of exports to Canada and Mexico every single year?  And we know that’s only going to grow in this North Central State here in the Heartland of the country once the USMCA is signed into law.  It will be the largest trade deal in the history of this country, but the Congress has to pass it.  But we’re confident that if Speaker Pelosi will put it on the floor, it’s going to pass.  And it’ll pass the Senate, and President Trump will sign it into law.\nSo I want you to let your voice be heard.  Let all the people representing Minnesota in Washington, D.C. know that the folks here at Safety Signs know that a growing economy relies on trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first. And while you’re at it, give Congresswoman Angie Craig a call and tell her you want the USMCA voted on the floor of the House and you wanted voted this year.  Give her a call and let her know.  And tell her I told you.  (Applause.)  All right?\nI mean, tell Congresswoman Angie Craig, “Let’s put politics aside.”  And tell Speaker Pelosi to bring that trade deal to the floor and deliver a real win for all the people of Minnesota and all the people of America.\nBut listen, let me thank you all.  Thank you all for taking time.  Again, I want to express my appreciation to Sue and Jay Blanchard for your example, for your hospitality, for being just great, great small-business owners here in Minnesota.  We’re really proud to be with you today.\nAnd I want to congratulate again each and every one of you for making — making a business like this have such a great impact on this community, and, frankly, on the life of this state and this nation.  And I want to promise you — I want to promise you: On behalf of my friend who’s going to be landing not too long in the Twin Cities in that big blue and white plane, and on behalf of the First Family, and on behalf of our family, we’re never going to stop fighting for the — to keep the promises that we made the people of Minnesota.  We’re going to make America safer than ever before.  We’re going to make America and Minnesota more prosperous than ever before.  And to borrow a phrase, we’re going to keep America great.\nThanks, everybody.  God bless you.  (Applause.)  God bless Minnesota.  And God bless America.  Thanks for the warm welcome.  (Applause.)\nEND\n",

        "text": "South Lawn4:32 P.M. EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So, we just completed a negotiation with China.  We’re doing very well.  We’re having another one tomorrow.  I’m meeting with the Vice Premier over at the White House.  And I think it’s going really well, I will say.  I think it’s going really well.\nSo, we had a very, very good negotiation with China.  They’ll be speaking a little bit later, but they’re basically wrapping it up, and we’re going to see them tomorrow, right here.  And it’s going very well.\nQ    Mr. President, what about the story about former President — Vice President Joe Biden and Ukraine, that he received $900,000 to himself, from Burisma Holdings?  Do you think that’s true?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  What happened?  Who took $900,000?\nQ    There’s a story out there that your personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said on “Sean Hannity” last night that there is a possibility that Joe Biden took $900,000 out of —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I hope it’s not true that — Joe Biden took $900,000?  I haven’t heard that.  I hope it’s not true.  For the sake of the country, I hope that’s not true.  But I don’t know anything about it.\nQ    Do you know the whistleblower’s name?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  What?\nQ    Do you know the whistleblower’s name?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Who?\nQ    Do you know the whistleblower’s name?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know.  But I know the whistleblower has been very inaccurate because when we released the transcript of the conversation that I had with the President of Ukraine, who — frankly, today, was very good; somewhere in Ukraine, I guess, gave a news conference on unrelated things — was asked a question, and he said, “President Trump behaved in a perfectly fine manner.  There was nothing wrong in any way, shape, or form.”  Something to that effect.  So, I appreciate that.\nBut the President of Ukraine, that should be case over, because the President of Ukraine said that the call was absolutely fine.  I think he said that it resembled very much — and he remembered it — it was just like the transcript.\nNow, the transcript is a perfect transcript.  There shouldn’t be any further questions.  But the President of Ukraine just made that statement, so that’s good.\nQ    Mr. President, what conversations have you had with Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know those gentlemen.\nQ    You were in pictures with them.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Now, it’s possible I have a picture with them, because I have a picture with everybody.  I have a picture with everybody here.  But somebody said there may be a picture or something where — at a fundraiser or somewhere.  And so — but I have pictures with everybody.\nQ    Have you talked with them?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know if there’s anybody I don’t have pictures with.\nI don’t know them.  I don’t know about them, I don’t know what they do.  But, I don’t know, maybe they were clients of Rudy.  You’d have to ask Rudy.  I just don’t know.\nQ    Have you spoken with Rudy Giuliani today, sir?  Have you spoken to him?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No.\nQ    Mr. President, should the Senate allow a full trial if the House does impeach?  The Republican (inaudible) Mitch McConnell said he would.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don’t know how you can impeach on a conversation with the President of a country — in this case, Ukraine — which was a perfect conversation, where the President of Ukraine just said there was no pressure put on him whatsoever, that we had an absolutely perfect conversation.  Then, on top of that, and maybe less importantly, frankly, but on top of that, we have a transcript of the conversation, fortunately, that’s perfect.\nAnd I do think this: I think it’s very unfair to heads of countries when they think every time they make a conversation or have a conversation with the President of the United States, it’s going to be on, you know, all over the world.  I think that’s very unfair.\nBut, in the case — in the case of what we’re talking about, we released a perfect conversation.  The President of Ukraine just confirmed that.  And that should be case over.\nI will say this: Adam Schiff took that conversation before he saw it and fabricated a conversation.  To me, that’s criminal.  What he did is criminal.\nQ    Mr. President, do you intend to block Ambassador Yovanovitch from testifying tomorrow?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I just don’t think you’re running country — I just don’t think that you can have all of these people testifying about every conversation you’ve had.  In this case, we have a transcript.  And I’ve given it almost immediately.  It’s called “transparency.”  Nobody has been more transparent than me.  So, you have a transcript.  And in this case, you also have the President of Ukraine confirming that, absolutely, it was a perfect conversation.\nBut the Democrats have committed crimes because they made up the conversation.  The whistleblower was wrong.  You know, I don’t think people should be allowed.  You have to run a country.  I don’t think you should be allowed to do that.\nQ    Mr. President, have you spoken to the U.S. diplomat’s —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Say it?\nQ    Have you spoken to the U.S. diplomat’s wife, Anne Sacoolas?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I can’t hear.\nQ    Have you spoken to the U.S. diplomat’s wife, Anne Sacoolas?\nQ    Have you spoken with the U.S. diplomat’s wife, Anne Sacoolas?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Are you talking about in the UK?\nQ    Yeah.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They’re in the process of being spoken to.  We’re working on that.  I did have a conversation yesterday with Boris Johnson, a good one.  And we’re talking about diplomatic immunity.  It’s a very interesting situation.  We are trying to work something out.\nQ    Will you reconsider the decision?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So we’re going to work — we’re going to try and work something out.  I think we’ll be able to.\nQ    Mr. President — Mr. President, sir, Secretary Perry was just subpoenaed by the House Intel Committee for documents related to the — to Ukraine, sir.  Any response to that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  How many people can they talk to?  We had a simple conversation.  Everybody knows what the conversation was because I gave it immediately when I heard about it.\nThe whistleblower, who seems to be a Democrat that’s involved with a lot of people, gave a false interpretation of the conversation because we have the conversation.\nThe President of Ukraine just said, just now, that the conversation was absolutely perfect.  No problem.  It was a very good conversation.  So I don’t know why they’d be calling Rick Perry.  I don’t know why they’d be calling all these people.  It’s a very bad situation for our country.\nQ    How do you know the whistleblower is a Democrat, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It was reported.\nQ    Are you concerned that Rudy Giuliani could be indicted in all of this?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I hope not.  Again, I don’t know how he knows these people —\nQ    They’re his clients.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  What?\nQ    They’re his clients.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay, well, then, they’re clients.  I mean, you know, he’s got a lot of clients.  So, I just don’t know.  I haven’t spoken to Rudy about it.  I don’t know.\nI will say this: From what I heard — I just heard about this — they said, “We have nothing to do with it.  We’re totally — we have nothing to do with it.”\nQ    Were you joking when you asked China to investigate the Bidens?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Was I what?\nQ    Were you joking when you asked China to investigate?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  China has to do whatever they want.  If they want to look into something, they can look into it.  If they don’t want to look into it, they don’t have to.  Frankly, are far as I’m concerned, if China wants to look into something, I think that’s great.  And if they don’t want to, I think that’s great too.  That’s up to China.\nYeah.\nQ    Mr. President, thank you.  Is it safe to say that Trey Gowdy is now your Chief Counsel and Rudy Giuliani is moving to the back?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, Trey Gowdy is a terrific guy.  I think there’s a problem with he can’t start for another couple of months because of lobbying rules and regulations.  So, you’ll have to ask about that.\nI just heard Trey Gowdy can’t start until sometime after January because of the lobbying rules and regulations.  So, I don’t know.  So, we’ll have to see.\nQ    So Giuliani stays on?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I haven’t spoken to him.  I haven’t spoken.\nGo ahead.\nQ    Which of the three choices on Syria that you just articulated in a tweet do you think you will follow?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Perhaps the last one, I hope.  I hope the last one.  Of the three, I hope it’s going to be the last one.\nLook, we have no soldiers in Syria.  We’ve won.  We’ve beat ISIS.  And we’ve beat them badly and decisively.  We have no soldiers.\nThe last thing I want to do is bring thousands and thousands of soldiers in and defeat everybody again.  We’ve already done that.\nSo what we have is really two choices: You have the choice of bringing in the military and defeating everybody again, or you have the choice of financially doing some very strong things to Turkey so that they take it a little bit easy on, really, competition that is — I don’t think it’s being fairly treated in many ways, okay?  We have a very good relationship with the Kurds.  Or we can mediate.  I hope we can mediate, John.  I hope we can mediate.\nQ    Has Turkey gone beyond the limits, in your opinion, so far?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Say it?\nQ    Has Turkey gone beyond the limits you set up so far?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Turkey knows where I stand.  And the last thing — okay, very simple: We had a big victory.  We left the area.  I don’t think the American people want to see us go back in with our military, go back into that area again.\nWe won.  We left the area.  I don’t think we want to go back in.  Let’s see what happens.  We are going to possibly do something very, very tough with respect to sanctions and other financial things.\nQ    Mr. President, on Minnesota — you’re headed to Minnesota.  Do you think you can win in Minnesota?  It’s a long-time blue state.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think we can win.  It’s been a long time since a Republican won.  We have a 20,000-seat auditorium.  You know, we have the — it’s essentially Madison Square Garden.  And it’s sold out.  Over 80,000 people requested tickets.  It’ll be totally sold out.  I don’t know who’s going, but it’ll be totally sold out.  If you’re not going to be there, I’m going to miss you.  But they have a line now that’s many blocks long.  It’s amazing.  We have a line, right now in Minnesota, that’s many blocks long.  I think I can win in Minnesota.\nQ    Do you think Ilhan Omar is helping you win in Minnesota?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think Omar is helping us win in Minnesota and other places.  I’ll see you all — I’ll see you in Minnesota.  I’ll see you in Minnesota.\nEND\n4:43 P.M.

        "text": "Manning FarmsWaukee, Iowa\n3:16 P.M. CDT\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, hello, Iowa!  (Applause.)  To Governor Reynolds; to Senator Grassley; Senator Ernst; former Congressman David Young; to EPA’s Assistant Administrator Anne Idsal; to Speaker of the House Pat Grassley –- (applause); all the local leaders and guests and neighbors and friends; and to Rob Manning and Manning Farms: It is great to be back in the Hawkeye State.  Thank you for that wonderful, warm welcome.  (Applause.)\nI’m really honored to see you all turned out today.  Thank you for taking some time away from work and your obligations to talk about an issue of great importance to Iowa and great importance to the nation.\nBut let me say thanks to a few friends who are with us today, not just — not just do I want to thank her for that overly generous introduction, but I have to tell you, there is no more dynamic or hardworking governor in the United States of America than Governor Kim Reynolds.  Would you join me in thanking her?  Take a bow, Kim.  (Applause.)  She’s doing a phenomenal job for Iowa.  (Applause.)\nAnd let me thank another friend of mine who I’ve come to know well.  In my duties as Vice President, I find my way to the United States Senate on a regular basis, and I get a chance to interact with both of your senators.  But I’ll tell you, this one — this one is amazing.  She likes to say she’s a mother, a soldier, a leader.  She was born and raised here, combat veteran, served our country for almost a quarter of a century in the Armed Forces of the United States.  And I’ll tell you today: She is a champion for Iowa and a champion for the conservative agenda.  Join me in thanking Senator Joni Ernst for her strong and principled leadership.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Senator.\nAnd finally, it’s a real privilege to be here with, frankly, a hero of mine.  I first discovered him on CSPAN back in the 1990s — (laughter) — when he was serving in the United States House of Representatives.  And I said, “I like that guy.”  He would go on to the United States Senate.  In fact, he served in the Congress now for more than 40 years.  And I can tell you, he has been a champion for his fellow Iowa farmers like no one else.  He has been a champion for our constitutional liberties as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and he’s obviously a terrific grandfather.  Join me in thanking Senator Chuck Grassley for his great, great leadership for Iowa.  (Applause.)\nIt really is great to be here with so many friends.  And let me mention one more friend of mine, who, when I told him last night that I was headed to Iowa, I think he looked just a little bit jealous.  But he’s a man who loves the state of Iowa and a man the people of Iowa put their confidence in three years ago.  I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.  (Applause.)\nBut it is great to be back on a farm.  And it’s especially great to be here at a — at a great family farm here in Iowa.  You know, I grew up south of Highway 40 myself in southern Indiana.  (Laughter.)  I didn’t grow up on a farm but we — we had some cows and I hung up — hung out all the time with friends who were on family farms.  And this one we’re standing on today is so emblematic of everything that’s great about family farming.\nYou know, I’m told that Rob Manning is just the latest in a long line of farmers in his family.  He’s tilled this land and raised animals for five generations.  And today, the hardworking men and women of Manning Farms have helped the Hawkeye State earn its place as the nation’s largest corn producer, second-largest soybean producer, and the number-one producer of pork in the country.  I mean, the truth is, what you grow here, what you raise here, you export around the world.  So would you join me in thanking the Manning family and Rob and the whole team here at Manning Farms for all their leadership and all their contributions to the life of this state and nation?  (Applause.)\nYou know, the truth is, what you grow here, what you raise here in Iowa, you — you export not just across the country, but all over the wider world.  So we’re going to talk about trade today, which Iowa knows a whole lot about.  We’re going to talk about a great opportunity for Iowa workers and Iowa businesses.\nBut before that, let me just take a minute to reflect on the progress we’ve made because of the confidence the people of Iowa placed in this President and our administration back in 2016.\nYou know, when I think of the last three years, there’s really only one way I can describe it:  It’s been three years of action.  (Applause.)  It’s been three years of results.  It’s been three years of promises made and promises kept.  But we’re just getting started, Iowa.  (Applause.)\nI mean, think about it: After eight years of the weakest post-recession economy since the Great Depression, President Trump said that we could get this economy moving again if we put commonsense, conservative principles and free enterprise into practice.  And President Donald Trump delivered.\nThis President has actually signed more bills rolling back federal red tape than any President in American history.  And this President actually signed a measure that would ensure that farmers and ranchers can control and own their land “in fee simple,” as we like to say.  Private property was restored when the President repealed the disastrous Waters of the USA rule.  (Applause.)\nAnd President Trump also kept a promise when he signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history.  We cut taxes across the board for working families, for businesses large and small.  And when he did that, we ended the death tax for nearly every American farmer.  Death is no longer a taxable event.  (Applause.)\nAnd we also passed reforms and made it possible for farmers to immediately deduct 100 percent of the cost of new equipment.  Anybody around farming knows those input costs play a critical role in the vitality of farming and — and being able to literally write off those costs in a single year made a tremendous difference.\nSo it’s been about rolling back red tape.  It’s been about cutting taxes.  But we’ve also unleashed American energy.  Do you know, next year, the United States will be a net exporter of oil for the first time in 75 years?  (Applause.)\nAnd last week, I want to tell you, with the strong leadership of Governor Reynolds and with the unrelenting leadership of Senator Grassley and Senator Ernst, President Trump announced an agreement on the renewable fuel standard that will ensure net production reaches 15 billion gallons every year.  (Applause.)\nAnd I want to thank — I want to thank your senators and your governor for being such champions — such champions of renewable fuels.  I mean, Iowa is not just going to be feeding the country, we’re going to — we’re going to continue to fuel the country as well.  (Applause.)\nSo, as we cut taxes, roll back regulation, unleash American energy, the results have been amazing.  Since Election Day 2016, businesses large and small in the city and on the farm have created 6.5 million new jobs, including 22,000 jobs right here in the Hawkeye State.  (Applause.)\nBut I’m here today, my friends, because, for all the progress we’ve made, we’ve still got work to do.  Because as you heard from this stage earlier, we have an incredible opportunity before us.\nOver one year ago, President Trump negotiated the largest trade deal in American history: the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.  (Applause.)  I was there.  I was there all along the way for a lot of the negotiations, and I’ll tell you what: The President drove a hard bargain.  He put American jobs, American workers, and American farmers first, and negotiated a great deal.\nBut as I stand before you today, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress have refused to bring it to the floor of the House of Representatives.  And that’s why I’m here.\nI came to Iowa today to turn up the heat.  (Applause.)  I came to Iowa today to say it’s time for the Democrats in Congress to do their job, put politics aside, and pass the USMCA this year.  (Applause.)\nThe truth is — and we all know it — Democrats have been spending all their time on endless investigations and a partisan impeachment.  But enough is enough.  The American people deserve better.  (Applause.)  I mean, the time has come — the time has come for Congresswoman Cindy Axne and all the Democrats in Congress that represent Iowa to put Iowa first, put America first, and pass the USMCA this year.  (Applause.)\nAnd I’ll make you a promise: Whatever the Democrats in Congress choose to spend their time on, President Trump and I are never going to stop fighting for you and the agenda that Iowa voted for in 2016.  (Applause.)  Count on it.\nWe’re not going to allow Democrats in Congress to distract us from working on behalf of all of you and the people of this country.  We’re never going to stop delivering on a strong national defense, secure borders, more conservative judges to our courts, and jobs, jobs, jobs.  (Applause.)  We’re never going to stop fighting for that agenda because that agenda has made America great again.  (Applause.)\nSo I stand before you today, our nation and our liberties are more secure.  Unemployment is at a 50-year low, and more Americans are working today than ever before.  And the truth is, the American economy has come roaring back because of the leadership of this President, because of the strong support of our allies in the Congress and in state houses around the country.\nBut I want to assure you, the President and I also know this economy has mostly come back because all of you.  Because given the opportunity of more freedom, more opportunity, the American people have stepped up.  And with their hard work and dedication and commitment, you brought the American economy back.  It’s one story at a time, one family at a time.\nI mean, this — the truth is, it’s stories like a farmer that I heard about on the way here nearby in Dallas City, whose family has been a pillar of the community for generations.  In fact, I was told today that when they first started out, his family used draft horses to plow their fields, and had to practically feed their livestock by hand.  But today, that same farm has drawn national attention by using state-of-the-art technology.  They’re producing more crops at a lower cost.  They’re making this community, this state, and this nation proud.  So would you join me in recognizing Tom Barrett and the whole Barrett family farm?  Where are you all?  (Applause.)  Thank you, Tom.\nI’m told we also have with us the first-generation owners of a farm just a few miles down the road.  They started it three decades ago with just a few dollars to their name.  And since then, they’ve grown that farm to more than 150 employees, hundreds of head of cattle and hogs.  And as they’ve said, most importantly, it’s where they raised their four daughters and two sons.  They are proof of the American Dream, in this first- generation family farm.  So would you join me in giving a warm round of applause to two hardworking farmers here in Iowa that represent all — everything that’s great about agriculture?  Brett and Teresa Voss, where are you?  (Applause.)  Take a bow.  Here we are.  Thanks, Brett.  Thanks, Teresa.\nI mean, I mentioned these two families because they’re really emblematic of each and every one of you.  They’re proof that you give American farmers and American workers a level playing field, that our farmers and our ranchers and our workers can compete and win with anyone in the world.  It’s the truth.  (Applause.)\nAnd that’s why, since the first day of this administration, we’ve been working to open up markets all over the world.  I’m proud to report to you that President Trump renegotiated our trade agreement with South Korea.  Earlier this week, the President actually signed agreements with Japan that not only will expand digital trade but will expand agricultural trade by billions of dollars a year to Japan.  (Applause.)\nThis President has also put China on notice that the era of economic surrender is over.  We’ve taken a strong stand to demand that China open their markets to what we make and what we grow and treat American businesses fairly.  (Applause.)\nThe President has been taking a strong stand, but in just the last few weeks, China announced the purchase of more than 2 million metric tons of soybeans.  And as I learned on the way here from our U.S. Trade Representative, we’re going to welcome a Chinese delegation to our nation’s capital a little bit later this week.  (Applause.)  The negotiations are going forward with China, but I promise you, President Trump is going to continue to stand strong for American workers and American farmers.  (Applause.)\nSo we’ve made great progress, but make no mistake about it:  As you’ve heard from this stage today, when we get the USMCA done, it’s going to be a big win for America, and a big win for American farmers.  I mean, the truth is, we’re gathered here today on this beautiful farm on this breezy day because it’s time for Congress to act.  It’s time for Congress to pass the USMCA.  (Applause.)\nAnd you know why.  According to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA is going to add about $68 billion to our economy, right out of the gate.  And we predict, conservatively, that it will create more than 175,000 new jobs.  They also proposed that the USMCA will increase American agricultural exports by more than $2 billion.\nNow, here in Iowa, this great state already exports more than $6.6 billion in goods and services to Canada and Mexico every year.  In fact, nearly half of all of Iowa’s exports go to Mexico and Canada.  And nearly 100,000 good-paying Iowa jobs depend on exports.  That’s why your governor, that’s why your senators, that’s why your President, are demanding that Congress pass the USMCA and pass it this year.  (Applause.)  Iowa is depending on it.  (Applause.)\nAnd the truth is, Iowa’s farmers and ranchers really have the most to gain, since this great state is the nation’s second-largest agricultural exporting state.  You produce more than $10.3 billion in goods every single year.  And under the USMCA, we know these numbers are only going to grow, supporting jobs and opportunities and families across Iowa.  It’s going to create more prosperity all across this state.  And that’s why I wanted to come here to talk about it.\nThe truth is, we can get it done but it’s going to take all of us to do it.  I came here to turn up the heat.  But now it’s time for Iowans to turn up the heat on your Democrats in Congress and tell them Iowa needs the USMCA this year.  (Applause.)  Will you do it?  (Applause.)\nI mean, I want you to — I want you to reach out to your elected officials in Washington, D.C.  Tell them — say, “I ran into Mike on a farm the other day” — (laughter) — “and he was pointing out to me that half of our exports from Iowa, as the governor had said, go to Canada and Mexico.”  And we got this great new trade agreement that’s a win for agriculture.  It’s a — it’s a win for Iowa, a win for America and you need to get it done.  I mean, tell them what the USMCA is going to mean to Iowa farmers.  But let me save you a nickel.  You don’t need to call Senator Joni Ernst or Senator Chuck Grassley because they’re leading the charge in the United States Senate for the USMCA.  (Applause.)\nThe President I couldn’t be more grateful for their leadership.  But right here in Waukee, there are some people you can call.  (Laughter.)  I mean, why don’t you call Congresswoman Cindy Axne?  Call Congresswoman Abby Finkenauer.  And while you’re at it, call Congressman Dave Loebsack, and tell them, “Iowa needs the USMCA.”  (Applause.)\nAnd by the way, after you — after you make that call to the people representing Iowa, you know, it seems like every four years, about this time, you see a lot of people coming through Iowa, right?  It seems like there’s a lot of politicians making their way through this state, getting ready for next year’s election.  This first-in-the-nation state of Iowa.  (Applause.)  And I got to tell you — I got to tell you, you need to know, every single Democrat running for President is opposed to the USMCA.\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  So if you run into him at a diner, or on a street corner — which I know is pretty common around here in Iowa — (laughter) — you need to tell the Democrats running for the highest office in the land that Iowa needs the USMCA.  (Applause.)\nI mean, I’ll tell you, one of the things I love about Iowa is that it’s so much like Indiana — people with big hearts and strong opinions.  (Laughter.)  So let them hear your opinion.  It will make a difference.\nListen, I want to thank you for coming out today.  I really do.  Coming out in the middle of a busy week, taking some time to focus on an issue that’s so important to this state, so important this nation.\nAnd I — let me — let me say again, how grateful I am to Senator Grassley, Senator Ernst, and your great Governor Kim Reynolds.  Would you give them one more round of applause?  They are just incredible champions.  (Applause.)  Thank you so much.\nAnd also, just on behalf of my wife, Karen, and our family, let me just take this opportunity also to say thank you for the privilege of being your Vice President.  It is the greatest honor of my life.  (Applause.)  Thank you for the confidence you placed in your President and his Vice President.\nAnd finally — finally, let me say it’s also great to be back on a farm.  I’m pretty partial to the farm.  (Laughter.)  I mean, the truth is, farmers have contributed so much to the life of this nation, you can never calculate all of it.  And I’m not just talking about to the economy throughout the long history of this country.  But farmers and family farmers have contributed so much vitality to our communities and to our states.  Farmers have served in our armed forces.  Their patriotism and their values have strengthened this nation throughout our history.\nYou know, I’m always struck — that book that I try and open every single morning in a little quiet time, how many times we’re told to consider the farmer.  And I believe that’s because in — in the farmer, we — we find all the virtues that lead to a happy and productive life:  honesty, integrity, hard work, resilience, family, and faith.\nAnd so you being out here today, and the support that you have shown to this President and his Vice President, our agenda, means that much more to me because it comes from the American farmer.  It comes from the best of America.  (Applause.)\nAnd in the days and weeks that lie ahead, I’ll make you a promise.  I’ll make you promise.  You know, one of the more humorous things that I ever hear is when people will stop me as I’m traveling around the country and they say, “Tell the President just to keep going forward.”  You know, that’s something you never have to tell President Donald Trump.  (Laughter and applause.)\nI tell people, like we used to say in Indiana, “All the reverse is stripped out of that pickup truck. It only goes forward and we’re never going to stop fighting for the agenda that Iowa voted for.”  (Applause.)  I promise you.\nWe’re never going to stop fighting — never going to stop fighting for the policies that will revive the American economy, strengthen the constitutional foundation of our courts, rebuild our military.\nAnd I know that with your continued support, we’re going to keep America growing strong.  We’re going — we’re going to make America safer than ever before.  We’re going to make America more prosperous than ever before.  When we get this USMCA done and on the President’s desk, with President Donald Trump in the White House, with these great leaders representing and leading you from the Congress to the state house, and with God’s help, we’re going to keep America great.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  God bless you, Iowa.  And God bless America.  (Applause.)\nEND\n3:42 P.M. CDT\n"

        "text": "Roosevelt Room3:38 P.M. EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  I’ll start by saying I just spoke with Boris Johnson, and we had a good talk about a number of subjects, and we’ll maybe talk about it a little bit later.  But we had an extended conversation and some pretty good ideas, I think.  They want to see if we can do a couple of things, and they’ll be doing certain things for us.\nI want to also thank the Minneapolis Police Department.  They have been so incredible, what they’ve done.  Tomorrow, we have a tremendous amount of people planned to go.  I know the requests have been incredible.  So, I think it’s a great state and we’re going to have a lot of fun tomorrow night.  I think a lot of you are going to be with us.  And then, on Friday night, we’ll be going to Louisiana, and there’s a big election on Saturday to see whether or not there’s a runoff, most likely.  And I think we’ll do very well.  The Republicans are doing very well despite the witch hunt that they have on Republicans.\nSo I just want to thank everybody for being here and coming to the White House on this important occasion.  In a few moments, I’ll be signing two executive orders to expand our record-breaking regulatory reduction campaign that is helping to fuel our incredible economic boom.  I guess the stock market is up close to 250 points today, and this is despite lots of trade deals that are getting done one by one.\nWe did a deal with South Korea — a big one, a really big one.  And we did one yesterday with Japan.  And that now goes into effect, and it’s tremendous for our farmers.\nAs you know, we have China coming.  They’ll be coming tomorrow.  We have the Vice Premier of China coming.  So we have a lot of big things happening.  We have some tremendous deals under negotiation.  So despite all of that, we have a great economy and a great market.  Our housing market is on fire, and things are really doing well.\nYou look at Asia, they’re not doing well.  Look at China; China is having a hard time at this moment, and I think they’d like to make a deal very badly.\nAnd so we have a lot of things that are really exciting.  And to be in the midst of negotiating some of the worst trade deals ever made, and to be breaking them up and changing them for the good of the American taxpayer and for our country, and to still be doing so well.  We had over 100 record-breaking stock markets.  I think 121 or something.  I’ll get you the exact number.  But many, many days, we broke the record.  And we continue to do well.\nAnd when these trade deals are done, and when certain other things that we’re doing are done, it’s going to be at a level that’s incredible.\n(Baby coos.)\nThat was the cutest noise.  What was that?  (Laughter.)  I heard this — see, I’m used to hearing them.  (Laughter.)  And there’s nothing cute about them.  (Laughter.)  So beautiful.  And don’t feel bad, he can — just do whatever you want, okay?  (Laughter.)  That’s a beautiful sound.\nToday, we take bold, new action to protect Americans from out-of-control bureaucracy and stop regulators from imposing secret rules and hidden penalties on the American people.\nWe’re delighted to be joined on this occasion by Acting Director Russ Vought, who has really done a fantastic job; Deputy Attorney [General] Jeffrey Rosen.  Are you busy enough, Jeff?  (Laughter.)  Huh?  And Congressman Mark Meadows.  Mark, fantastic that you’re here.  Louisiana Solicitor General — oh, I’ll be there — Liz Murrill.  Where’s Liz?  I’ll see you on Friday.\nMS. MURRILL:  Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know if you’ll be there, but we have a big crowd, so it’s going to be great.  Thank you very much, Liz.\nAnd several other state and local officials.  We want to thank you all for being here.\nFor many decades, federal agencies have been issuing thousands of pages of so-called “guidance” documents — a pernicious kind of regulation imposed by unaccountable bureaucrats in the form of commentary on how rules should be interpreted.\nAll too often, guidance documents are a backdoor for regulators to effectively change the laws and vastly expand their scope and reach.  Guidance has frequently been used to subject U.S. citizens and businesses to arbitrary and sometimes abusive enforcement actions.  Ha!  It sounds like they’re talking about me.  (Laughter.)  I think they’re talking about me.  I might have a conflict in signing this deal.\nBecause of these materials and the fact that these materials are too often hidden and hard to find, many Americans learn of the rules only when federal agents come knocking on the door.\nThis regulatory overreach gravely undermines our constitutional system of government.  Unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats must not be able to operate outside of the democratic system of government — wow — imposing their own private agenda on our citizens.  A permanent federal bureaucracy cannot become a fourth branch of government, unanswerable to American voters.  In America, the people must always reign.\nWith us today is Andy Johnson from Wyoming — great place — whose family is one of many that suffered from the absurd redefinitions and interpretations of federal bureaucrats.  And Andy is here to say a few words.  I’d like to hear that Andy because I think you might be speaking about me or to me.  Thank you very much.  Where’s Andy?  Come on up here with that beautiful baby.  Beautiful.  That’s great.  Thank you, Andy.\nMR. JOHNSON:  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Go ahead, please.\nMR. JOHNSON:  Well, thank you for having me, today, and my wife Morgan and my son, Roaman.  I work as welder in Wyoming, and about five years ago, when I applied for a stock pond permit for my private property, I had no idea that the EPA would come knocking at my door and threaten me and my family — civilly, criminally, and a fine of $37,500 per day.  The fines were up to $16 million when Pacific Legal Foundation stepped in and sued the EPA on my behalf, and my family.\nAnd, at that point, the EPA changed their attitude; we were able to come to an agreement.  We won our case, but unlike a lot of other middle class Americans, that’s not the case.  They — we could have never fought.  The litigation was way, way too expensive.  So I’d just like to thank the President today for signing this executive order, which will hold the EPA and other government agencies more responsible for their actions.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s fantastic.  Thank you.\nMR. JOHNSON:  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So they had you up to $16 million.  But that’s peanuts for you, right?  (Laughter.)  That’s great.  Glad it worked out and it’s working out even better.\nWe’re also joined by Richard Schok, who was prevented from expanding his business because of the obscure regulatory guidance on a rule from the 1980s — an old rule.  And, Richard, please come up and talk about it.  Thank you.  Thank you, Richard.  Please.\nMR. SCHOK:  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.\nMR. SCHOK:  Thank you.\nMr. President, I’d like to thank you for the invitation to speak and bring much-needed attention to the reform to the rulemaking process used by the regulatory agencies.\nI operate a family-owned business in Fairbanks, Alaska.  We purchased some land for our business about 20 years ago so we could move operations out of town to the new facility and expand our facilities.  We’ve spent the better part of 10 years and over $300,000 fighting with the regulatory agencies over the arbitrary and capricious nature of the Army Corps of Engineers wetland designation and their use of the Alaska supplement versus the 1987 congressionally-mandated Wetlands Manual.\nThis is effort is also — this effort does not include the time and energy put forth by the Pacific Legal Foundation on our behalf.  I’d like to thank those folks as well.\nThe last straw for us is when we lost our appeal in the Ninth Circuit Court when they held that the agencies can make the regulations they want and require without congressional approval or oversight.\nI’m hopeful that the changes made today — with this executive order, other land owners will not be negatively impacted as we have.  Thank you again for this opportunity.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s great.  Thank you, Richard.  (Applause.)\nWell, thank you very much, Richard.  You know, you mention the Ninth Circuit.  So, we have a lot of great new judges in the Ninth Circuit, and we’re going to be very close to 182 new judges over the next very short period of time.  So that’ll be — we are in record territory by a lot.\nSo we’re going to have 182 new federal judges, not including two Supreme Court judges.  And I guess we’re already at the 156 number.  Jeff and Mark, I think we’re at about 156 judges now signed and sitting and doing a great job.  But we’ll be at about 182 before we normalize — normalize, meaning retirement and various other reasons that they leave.  And we could average about 40 or so a year from that process.  So we’ll have a — probably, a very big record number of judges — federal judges in this administration.\nAnd I want to thank President Obama for leaving us 138 empty slots, because that’s a first.  (Laughter.)  That’s a first.  I said, “How many do we have?”  He said, “Sir, you have 138 to 142.”  I said, “You’ve got to be kidding.”  So I want to thank you, President Obama.\nAnd again, Richard, thank you very much for your nice words.  When Americans and their businesses are sued by government agencies, they are sometimes not even given an explanation of what they do wrong, and how they can fix it.\nWith us today is Kevin Lunny, whose company was forced out of business through the terrible practice of a certain way of government handling of things.  Not fair; not right.  Kevin, please come up and discuss it.  Thank you.  Thank you, Kevin.  Thank you very much.\nMR. LUNNY:  My name is Kevin Lunny.  I’m a third-generation cattle rancher at the Point Reyes National Seashore in California.\nAbout several years ago, we also were the owners of the Drakes Bay oyster farm — a sustainable family business where we produced nearly half of all the oysters in the state of California.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Wow.\nMR. LUNNY:  In 2014, the National Park Service launched a National Environmental Policy Act process that costs millions of dollars and lasted over eight years.  And the National Park Service forced our oyster farm out of business.  And if that wasn’t enough for our family and our community, today the rest of agriculture, which includes about another 24 ranching family farm businesses within the National Seashore, are facing the exact same process.\nOur fear is that that process could ultimately be facing — and those families may be facing what the oyster farm faced.  And so I’m here, Mr. President, thanking you for calling this meeting together so we can have this discussion.  We urge you to continue your good work in following these policies and making sure these federal policies are managed in a way that family farmers and ranchers like us can actually benefit and survive these procedures and — so they’re not just for federal agencies that have pre-decided what they want before the process has begun and for professional litigants that abuse the process.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well thank you, Kevin.  (Applause.)  (Applause.)  Thank you.  And the business is — is the business gone now?\nMR. LUNNY:  The business is gone.  Twenty million oysters destroyed.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Wow.  They forced you out of business?\nMR. LUNNY:  Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So, I have to say, Kevin, I really — I know what you’ve been through.  I read a little bit about it.  And I’ve heard about it, also.  And it’s very sad.  But we thank you both for being here, very much.  Really, thank you very much.\nNo American should ever face such persecution from their own government — except, perhaps, your President.  (Laughter.)  Don’t feel bad, Kevin.  (Laughter.)  They treated you better than they treat me.  (Laughter.)  I do believe that’s true, huh?  I do believe that’s true, Meadows.\nToday, I am taking action to stop it.  My first executive order will require agencies to publish guidance documents online, so that small businesses and everyday citizens can easily find them.\nAgencies will have to seek public input on the most important guidance, and the whole process will be closely overseen by the White House.  We’re going to have somebody right here in the White House looking at it, Kevin, so this doesn’t happen to other people.  You’re very brave to be here.  I really think it’s incredible.  I really mean it.  Americans will no longer be subject to the rules of hidden games that are played on the public.\nThe second order I will sign today will protect American citizens from secret interpretations of regulations, unexpected penalties, and violations of their rights.  From now on, agencies will be required to inform individuals about any case against them and respond to their arguments.  It will be the agency’s duty to fully educate small businesses about new regulatory changes.\nToday’s action is just the latest step in my administration’s tireless fight to curtail job-killing, soul-crushing regulations.  I want to thank Jeff for doing the great job.  The Justice Department worked very hard with all of our people over here.  They did a fantastic job and I want to thank you very much, Jeff.\nWe ended the war on American energy.  We’re cancelling restrictions that devastated American autoworkers.  We’re stopping regulations that micromanaged our great farmers.  We’re bringing major companies back to our country.  They want to be here.  We’re the hot economy.  We’re the place they want to be.  And we are reversing the last administration’s ridiculous attack on, as an example, incandescent lightbulbs.\nWe’re also working, as you know — cars are very expensive.  Far too expensive.  And we’re going to be able to bring the price of cars down about $3,500 — and, at the same time, make the car a lot more affordable and a lot safer.  So we’re going to have affordability, safety, and we’ll also be getting some of the old cars off the roads, because people now have an incentive to buy a new car that’s a lot less of a problem, from an environmental standpoint.  It’s really an amazing thing.\nWe’re going against California.  And they make their cars so light, it’s papier-mâché.  And you get in an accident; it’s very, very dangerous.  So we’re coming out with a whole new standard, and I think it’s going to be something very special.  It’s gotten tremendous receptivity.\nSame thing with the lightbulb, the incandescent lights.  Aside from the fact you look better — of course, who cares about looks?  But you do look better with incandescent.  They weren’t allowed.  And you have the privilege of buying now a much more expensive bulb under the past rules — much more expensive bulb that doesn’t have a good-looking light.  But maybe, very importantly, when the bulb is out and no good, it’s literally considered a hazardous waste site, because it’s all the gasses.  And if it breaks, you’re supposed to bring it to a certain location.  And I say, “Who does that?”  Nobody.  Nobody does.  It’s very dangerous.\nSo we have a — we’re allowing people to choose.  They can buy a much less expensive bulb that looks better, or they can spend a lot more money on what they were doing, and that’s fine, too.  They might like it.  It might last longer, and that’s okay.  But it is still a hazardous situation when you have to dispose of these things, whereas in the old system, you don’t have.  So we’re bringing the incandescent bulb back for those that want it.  We’re going to have both alternatives.  We like to have alternatives.\nAt the start of my presidency, I imposed a two-for-one rule on new regulations, requiring that for every new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.\nIn the first two years of the Obama-Sleepy Joe Biden administration, the cost of regulatory compliance went up by $245 billion.  Can you believe that?  And in our administration, we’ve taken it down by more than that.  So it’s $245 billion up, and we’ve taken it down by much more than that.\nAccording to the Economic Council of Advisers, our regulatory reductions will save the average American household over $3,000 — think of this — every single year.  Thanks to these regulation cuts, as well as our tax cuts and pro-American trade policies, our economy is stronger than it’s ever been.  Stronger than ever before.  And that’s despite all of these negotiations that we’re doing to really make us into something that we’ve never seen before — meaning, fair trade deals.\nWe’ve created 6.4 million new jobs.  Just last month, unemployment reached the lowest rate in over 50 years.  The African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates have hit record lows.  We have more people working in the United States today — almost 160 million people — than at any time in the history of our country.  Wages are rising very fast, and twice as fast for low-income workers.  The biggest beneficiary, actually, is the low-income worker.  Their wages are rising at a rate that we haven’t seen in many, many decades.\nWhen I first started campaigning — many of you were with me — I used to talk about workers that would make more, years ago, 21 years ago, than they made a few years ago, because now it’s gone up a lot.  But a few years ago.  And they’d have two jobs and three jobs, and yet they did better 21 years before.\nWith today’s executive order, we continue this incredible economic success and we defend American liberty for generations to come.\nI would like to now invite Acting Director of OMB Russ Vought to say a few words about the exciting news.  And I want to thank Russ for doing an incredible job.  And when Russ is finished, we’re going to sign the executive orders.  Thank you very much.\nACTING DIRECTOR VOUGHT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  As a result of your leadership, today we’re making a major step forward in the effort to drain the swamp and to get our arms wrapped around the administrative state.  We can’t do that until we know all of the dark, regulatory, stealth regulation that is out there, and that’s one of the reasons why we’re asking all agencies to be putting on their website — on a searchable website — all of these regulations, so that we can understand what it is, and anything that’s not put up there is rescinded.\nSecondly, we want to make sure that the American people — families and small businesses — are no longer bullied by their federal government.  We’ve all had to deal with the motor vehicle department down the street from us.  Think about dealing with the federal government; it’s an entirely different situation.  And the people that are here today, who have flown in on their own dime to be a part of this celebration, can attest to that.\nWe want to make sure that there are no stories ever again of people being bullied by their federal government.  So we’re thrilled that you took this on, Mr. President.  Looking forward to these executive orders.  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nCome on, folks.  Gather around.\n(The executive orders are signed.)\nWhere’s Kevin?\nMR. LUNNY:  Right here.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Come here.  (Hands over pen.)  (Applause.)\nPlenty to go around.  Okay.  Thank you very much everybody.  Congratulations.  (Applause.)\nQ    Are you going to take any action regarding the Turkish attacks in Northern Syria?  And have the Kurds, as Senator Graham said, been shamelessly abandoned?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So, we have no soldiers in the area.  We’ve been talking to Turkey for three years.  They’ve been wanting to do this for many years, as you know.  They’ve been fighting each other for centuries.  They’ve been fighting each other for — hundreds of years, this has been going on.\nWe were put into this battle — interjected.  It was supposed to be a 30 — a 30-day period.  And we’ve been there for many, many years.  And it’s time to get out.  We’re speaking to both sides.  We’ve told President Erdoğan how we feel.  But we are speaking to both sides, and we’re seeing what can be made out of a situation.\nBut we have no soldiers in the area, you know.  We’re getting out of the endless wars.  We have to do it.  And eventually somebody was going to have to make the decision.  And, frankly, we’re getting a lot of praise from that decision.  We — people are saying, “Got to sometime bring our people back home.”\nWe’re really serving and we were serving as a police force.  We had defeated ISIS.  We defeated the caliphate, 100 percent.  Erdoğan and the existing groups of people, including Kurds — but you have the PKK, which is a natural enemy with Turkey, and likewise and opposite, they’ve been fighting, again, for many, many years.  They have — they’re bitter enemies; have been always.  Probably, possibly always will be.\nSo we are — we are out of there.  We’ve been out of there for a while.  No soldiers whatsoever.\nWe are taking some of the most dangerous ISIS fighters out.  We’ve taken them out and we’re putting them in different locations where it’s secure.  In addition, the Kurds are watching.  And if the Kurds don’t watch, then Turkey is going to watch because they don’t want those people out any more than we do.  But we have taken a certain number of ISIS fighters that are particularly bad.  And we’ve wanted to make sure that nothing happened with them, with respect to getting out.  And I think we’re doing a great job.\nI think the people of this country — I campaigned on ending the endless wars.  We’re all over the world, fighting wars.  Half the places, nobody even knows what they’re doing over there.  And I feel that we are doing the right thing, and I think the country feels that, too.\nWe’ve had tremendous support outside of the Washington — little Washington area.  And even in Washington, people are saying, “You’re doing the right thing.”  It has to be done; otherwise, you’re never going to do it.\nAt the same time, we’re dealing with both sides.  We’re going to see what we can do.\nQ    In a statement this morning, you cautioned Erdoğan.  Since then, it appears as though there have been casualties on the Kurdish side.  Are you concerned about escalation?  And are you concerned that Erdoğan will try to wipe out the Kurds?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I will wipe out his economy if that happens.  I’ve already done it once, with Pastor Brunson.  I’m sure that he — I hope that he will act rationally.  You do have to understand: They’ve been fighting each other for many, many decades.  Actually, for centuries, they’ve been fighting each other.  And it was time for the Americans — we did a great job.\nWe took care of ISIS.  We captured 100 percent.  Do you remember I was thinking, John, of leaving at 97 and 96 percent?  And that last 3 or 4 percent was the hardest part.  And they told me it would take a year to two years to do it, and I did it in a month.  Remember that?\nI flew to Iraq and I met with a lot of great generals there.  Great generals.  They said, “Sir, we can do it in two weeks to a month.”  And we did it in two weeks to a month, and we took it.  And, in the meantime, we’ve been watching over a lot — with the Kurds — watching over a lot of prisoners.   Some very bad — some very bad people.  A few, in particular, are very bad.  Really bad.  And some of those people we’ve already taken.  We’ve taken them out.\nThey should go back, by the way.  They should go back to Europe.  Many of them came from Europe, but they should go back to Germany, to France, to — I spoke with Boris Johnson a couple — to UK.  Some to UK, actually.  But they came from various parts of Europe.  They didn’t come from our country, and we did them a big favor.\nAnd we said to France, we said to Germany, we said to various countries in Europe: “We’d like you to take your people back.”  “Well, we don’t want them.  We don’t want them.  How about you taking them?”  I said, “We don’t want them either.  Nobody wants them; they’re bad.  But somebody has to watch over them.”  I said, “Look, we did you a big favor.  You take your people back.  You take them back.”\nThey’re citizens, in many cases, of those countries — of France, Germany.  They didn’t want to take them back.  I gave them one chance, I gave them another chance, I gave them a third chance, and I even gave them a fourth chance.  They didn’t want to take them back.  Not that I blame them too much; they’re used to this with the United States — taking advantage of the United States, whether it’s on trade or NATO — to take advantage of the United States.\nBut we think that maybe the Kurds will do a job.  And if not the Kurds, we think Turkey will do a job.  But we have thousands of people.  Thousands.  I don’t know if you know that.  We have thousands of captured fighters, and thousands and tens of thousands of family members.  And we did a big favor to a lot of countries, and those countries didn’t want to take them back.  So that’s the way it goes.\nSteve.\nQ    What if some of these ISIS fighters escape and pose a threat elsewhere?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, they’re going to be escaping to Europe.  That’s where they want to go.  They want to go back to their homes, but Europe didn’t want them from us.  We could have given it to them.  They could have had trials.  They could have\ndone whatever they wanted.\nBut as usual, it’s not reciprocal.  You know my favorite word, “reciprocal.”  That’s all I want.  I don’t want an edge; I just want reciprocal.  And it’s not reciprocal, Steve.  It’s not a fair deal for the United States.\nAnd when President Obama took the PKK — you know, where they bring in PKK — that’s a tough deal because that’s been a mortal enemy of Turkey.  So when you bring them in into a partnership, it’s a tough situation because it’s tough for Turkey; it’s probably tough for them.  They’ve hated each other for many, many years — for hundreds of years.  I mean, it’s amazing, when you look at history and you look at culture.  But you look at the length of the time and the fighting for so long.\nSo we imposed ourself into it.  And look, I’ve said it — I said it just yesterday: The single worst country the United States — if you take a look at, you know, what we’re doing with countries and the relationships we have with countries —\nBut maybe putting it a different way: The worst mistake that the United States has ever made, in my opinion, was going into the Middle East.  It’s a quagmire.  We are up to close to $8 trillion, and we’re bringing our folks back home.  We have great, talented military.  We’re bringing them back home.\nOur military has never been stronger, but we’re now acting as police.  We’re — we’re policing areas.  We’re doing jobs that other countries should be doing.  We’re doing jobs, frankly, that Europe should be doing.  We’re doing jobs that Russia should be doing, that Iran should be doing, that Iraq, Turkey, Syria should be doing.  They should be doing this.  We shouldn’t be doing it.  We’re 7,000 miles away.\nQ    Lindsey Graham is talking about imposing economic sanctions on Turkey over this incursion into Syria.  What do you think about that?  Would you support that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think it’s okay.  I’ve already told that to President Erdoğan.  Far more than sanctions — I’ll do far more than sanctions.  Lindsey and I feel differently.  I think Lindsey would like to stay there for the next 200 years and maybe add a couple of hundred thousand people every place.  But I disagree with Lindsey on that.\nBut I will tell you that I do agree on sanctions, but I actually think much tougher than sanctions if he doesn’t do it in as humane a way as possible.  But I’ve gotten him to stop for — virtually, from the first day that I was in office.  But they wanted to fight, and that’s the way it is.  And they’ve done it for so long.\nYes, go ahead, please.\nQ    Sir, what does “as humane a way as possible” actually mean?  Does it mean civilians?  Or —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re going to have to see.  We’re going to have to define that as we go along.  They want to — if you listen to Erdoğan, he wants to have people go back to where they came from, go back to Syria.  Right now, he’s holding — in all fairness to him, he’s holding millions of people that would be all over the place if he wasn’t holding them.  So he wants to repatriate, he wants to have them go back into the area that he’s looking at.\nBut we’ll see.  We’ll see how he does it.  He can do it in a soft manner.  He can do it in a very tough manner.  And if he does it unfairly, he’s going to pay a very big economic price.\nQ    Mr. President, you said — with the letter that you sent up to Nancy Pelosi yesterday —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    — you appeared to declare war on the impeachment inquiry.  Can you tell us, in your own words, why you think it is incumbent upon the House to hold a full vote to authorize an inquiry?  And if they were to hold the vote and it were to be positive, would you then cooperate with the inquiry?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, let me just say that the Republican Party — and President — but the Republican Party has been treated extremely badly by the Democrats — very unfairly — because they have a tiny margin in the House.  They have eviscerated the rules.  They don’t give us any — any fair play.  It’s the most unfair situation people have seen.  No lawyers — you can’t have lawyers.  You can’t speak.  You can’t do anything.  You virtually can’t do anything.\nAnd then, on top of it, they have a guy named Schiff.  And Nancy Pelosi knows all this because she’s just as guilty as he is.  But you have a man named Schiff, where I had a perfect phone call with the President of Ukraine — like, I mean perfect.  People read it, but they don’t read that.  They heard Schiff’s version of it.  He defrauded the American public.  He gave the most horrible rendition, adding his own words.\nI mean, Mark Meadows is here.  I think I can say honestly, Mark, you didn’t believe it when you heard it.\nREPRESENTATIVE MEADOWS:  Right.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And Mark has never heard anything like it. And many of the people that we work with, including Democrats, have never heard anything like it.  He made up a phone call.  He made it up.  Because what happened is they spoke about a day too early.  They heard a whistleblower who came out with a false story — you know, people say, “Oh, it was always fairly close.”  It wasn’t close at all.  What the whistleblower said bore no relationship to what the call was.  We have a transcribed call, done by professionals.  And the call was a perfect call, but Schiff made it up.\nThen it turns out that the whistleblower was in cahoots with Schiff.  Then it turns out that the whistleblower is a Democrat — strong Democrat — and is working with one of my opponents as a Democrat that I might end up running against.  The whole thing is a scam.  It’s a fix.\nAnd we wrote a letter yesterday, and it probably ends up being a big Supreme Court case; maybe it goes a long time.  I don’t know.  But the Republican Party has been treated unbelievably badly and unfairly by the Democrats, John.\nQ    But then again, sir, if they held a vote in the full House, and the vote were to authorize, would you —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, yeah, that sounds okay.\nQ    — would you cooperate?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we would if they give us our rights. It depends.  If they vote and say you can’t have lawyers, you can’t ask questions, you can’t have anybody present — all of these crazy things.  And even some of the reporters said to me, “It really is an unfair situation.”\nThey ask all the questions and then — for instance, the ambassador who testified was a fine gentleman.  He gave great testimony for us.  But we don’t get to do any of that or show any of that, so they brought out only the couple of negative things, all which were knocked out by his other statements.  It was a great witness for us, but if you would’ve listened to them, you would’ve said it was a better witness for them.  It wasn’t.  It wasn’t even close.  He was a fine gentleman.  And we saw that, and we said that’s very unfair.\nYes.\nQ    Mr. President, there were reports this afternoon that the Chinese are lowering their expectations for a trade deal.  Are you also lowering your expectations for a trade deal?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I don’t think so.  I think they feel that I’m driving a tough bargain.  But I have to.  You know it better than anybody.  You do a good job over there.  I watch a lot.\nWe are so far down, in terms of where we started, from Presidents that didn’t do their job for many years.  Since the World Trade Organization founding — China went in in 2001 or so — China went in and just ripped off the world.\nSo, and I told that to President Xi.  I said, “You know, this can’t be like a 50/50 deal.”  Because a 50/50 deal, you’re like up there and we’re down here.  So a 50/50 deal, it doesn’t work, right?  You got to have a little balance.  This has to be a better deal from our standpoint.  And I think they fully understand it.\nOne of the really good meetings I had today was with our people on opioids and drugs and fentanyl — and fentanyl, in particular, with respect to your question.  And they said that Chinese leadership has a lot of respect for our President, and they are really being much more careful.  It’s a much different situation.\nWe have some great drug numbers.  Now, what is great drug — if you’re down 15, 16, 20, 25 percent, it’s still horrible what’s going on in this country and in the world.  In the whole world, it’s horrible.\nBut no, I think they have a lot of respect for us.  It’s the first time they’ve ever respected us.  I think China has a lot of respect for me and for our country and for what we’re doing, and I think they can’t believe what they’ve gotten away with for so many years.\nQ    Are the Chinese wrong to be putting pressure on the NBA, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, the NBA is a different thing.  I mean, I watch this guy, Steve Kerr, and he was like a little boy.  He was so scared to be even answering the question.  He couldn’t answer the question.  He was shaking.  “Oh, I don’t know.  I don’t know.”  He didn’t know how to answer the question.  And yet, he’ll talk about the United States very badly.\nI watched Popovich.  Sort of the same thing, but he didn’t look quite as scared, actually.  But they talk badly about the United States.  But when it talks about China, they don’t want to say anything bad.  I thought it was pretty sad, actually.\nQ    So are you okay with the Chinese government pressuring the NBA, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’ll be — it’ll be very — it’ll be very interesting.  Excuse me.\nQ    Are you okay then with the Chinese government pressuring the NBA over Hong Kong?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They have to work out their own situation.  The NBA is — they know what they’re doing.  But I watch the way that like Kerr and Popovich and some of the others were pandering to China, and yet to our country, they don’t — it’s like they don’t respect it.  It’s like they don’t respect it.\nI said, “What a difference.  Isn’t it sad?”  It’s very sad.  To me, it’s very sad.\nJohn.\nQ    Mr. President, Joe Biden came out for the first time today and said you should be impeached.  Your response?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, he’s falling like a rock.  We have him on tape with corruption.  I mean, he’s getting the prosecutor for, I guess, John, it was $2 billion — saying, “We’re not giving you the $2 billion” — or whatever the amount was — “unless you get rid of this prosecutor.”  And then he goes, “Lo and behold, the prosecutor was gone.”\nQ    It was $1.2 billion.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And that was the prosecutor — excuse me, John?\nQ    $1.2 billion.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  $1.2 billion.  Not a lot of money.  And then his son takes out $1.5 billion from China.\nAnd, by the way, the $50,000 a month that he was getting from Ukraine, it looks like it’s $168,000, split among him and somebody else — his friend.  And also there’s a payment of about $3 million to his son.  His son just got thrown out of the Navy.\nSo Biden is dropping like a rock.  I don’t think he’s going to make it.  I didn’t think he wasn’t going to make it for a long time.  I don’t think he’s going to make it.  And I guess this is one way he can do it.  You know, he didn’t say that until right now.  And he sees what’s happening to him.  I guess he’s no longer the frontrunner.\nBut, look, I feel badly for him because I know he’s going through a lot.  He’s been hit.  And he’s been caught red-handed.  I mean, here’s a man who is on tape saying exactly what he’s going to do in terms of corruption, and he gets away with it.  If that ever happened to a Republican, they’d be getting the electric chair right now.  They’d be right now being walked into the electric chair.  It’s a whole different standard.\nWhat Joe Biden said on tape — this isn’t like, “Gee-whiz, we think.”  What he said on tape — and the fake media doesn’t want to play the tape.  They hardly play it.  So I feel, you know, that it’s too bad what’s happened to him.  He is sinking and his campaign is sinking.\nBut he walked away with hundreds of — I mean, you look at the kind of numbers his son — who is, at best, incompetent — got thrown out of the Navy.  I don’t even want to say why; A subject that we just discussed.  I don’t want to say why.  But he gets thrown — and then all of a sudden, he’s making a deal with Ukraine, where they’re getting $168,000 a month between the two of them — $168,000 — and he gets $3 million payments and all of this money coming out?  And the kid has no expertise in energy, and it’s an energy company.  He has no expertise.  You and I both know much more than he does, John.\nAnd then you walk into China, and a couple of days later — 10 days later, to be exact — he gets $1.5 billion out of China, and he’s got no expertise.  And I have friends that are the smartest people on Wall Street.  I said, “Is that possible?”  They say, “No, it’s not possible.”  It’s a pretty sad situation.\nPlease.\nQ    Mr. President, I just want to clarify something you said earlier.  If Pelosi holds a vote on the floor on impeachment and commits to the rules of previous impeachment proceedings, you’ll participate in that investigation?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, if the rules are fair.\nQ    Okay.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I — because I don’t know how — I don’t know exactly your definition.\nIf Republicans get a fair shake — because the Republicans have been — look, we were very nice to them.  When Paul Ryan was the Speaker, he really wouldn’t give subpoenas.  And I’m not saying good, bad, or indifferent.  Here’s a man that knows it very well.  They’d go in with all of the corruption that you’ve been reading about, and all of the things that they did wrong with Comey, and all of these people and all of the things they did wrong.\nWhen we wanted a subpoena — meaning, they wanted a subpoena — it was very hard to get it and I’m not sure he ever even issued a subpoena.  And Nancy Pelosi issues subpoenas: “Come on in and get them.”  Gives them to Nadler.  Gives them to Crooked Schiff.\nI mean, this Schiff is one crooked guy.  The guy made up my phone call.  Think of it.  In the United States Congress, he made up my phone call.  And I’ve had people that said, “I didn’t like the way you talked to the Ukrainian President.”  I said, “Did you read my speech?”  “No, I heard Schiff.”  Shifty Schiff.  “I heard Schiff.”  I said — that’s how I said — I said, “Well, let me see what he said.”  A lot of people saw that.\nThis — and frankly, I think if it wasn’t for me, I don’t know if anybody would have even noticed and called him out.  He took my really — believe it or not — congenial and gentle words, and he made me sound like a tyrant.  It’s a terrible thing.  He defrauded the American public.\nI mean, honestly, I don’t know what can happen, but there are those that say he should be prosecuted for what he did.  He should certainly be impeached, but he should be prosecuted for what he did.  And I think he’s a very bad leader of this movement.\nYes, please.\nQ    And just, on the phone call, there’s a new report out today that the whistleblower says a White House official came to him and said you committed a crime on that call.  Did any White House official express any concern to you —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, no.\nQ    — or speak to you about that phone call afterward?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s all a big con, don’t you understand?  Look, the phone call, you have it; it’s the transcript.  That’s why they keep saying, “Oh, the whistleblower said this and that.”  What happened is, if they would have seen the transcript early, they wouldn’t have had a whistleblower, because he wouldn’t have said — there was nothing he could say.  All you have to do is read the transcript.  Very calm.\nAnd what’s even more important than the transcript, in a certain way?  Although, I think the transcript is the most important, because it was really plain vanilla.  No emotion.  No nothing.\nThese are crooked people that are doing — these are Democrats, headed by a — a Democrat lawyer, a big Democrat lawyer.  This is a con job.  This is a con being perpetrated on the United States public and even the world.  And the world is watching, and they — they get it better than a lot of other people.  It’s very interesting.\nBut a poll just came out today: A very small people want to see something — even though I only get negative press from you people — not you, necessarily.   But — but, that’s the way it is.\nSo, I say this: Look, all you have to do is read the transcript.  But you know what’s almost as good as the transcript, I think?  Is the Ukrainian President saying — he didn’t even know that they were talking about — “no pressure.”  The foreign minister of Ukraine saying, “No, it was a very normal call.  There was no pressure at all.”\nWhat is bad is when you see all of the elements, when you see that Schiff saw the whistleblower.  When you see what the whistleblower said about the phone call, and it was totally different.  He made it up.  And I don’t know why a person that defrauds the American public should be protected, okay?\nQ    Sir, then why did your administration try to bury that transcript in the extra level of —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, that I don’t know.  Again, I’m not a lawyer.  I can say this: I assume it was for leaks.  I have no idea.  I’m just answering.  Because this city is like the leaking capital of the world.  If you want to get something out to the press, all you have to do is hand it to somebody in Washington.\nSo, I assume it was for leaks.  I mean, I’ve read that, and it doesn’t seem like a big deal.  What is a big deal —\nQ    (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think they’re probably trying to protect it from leaks.\nBut here’s the other thing: We gave that transcript over almost immediately.  It wasn’t like we waited until now.  Until now would be immediately, because it’s only been doing it for three weeks.  We gave that transcript up almost immediately.\nAnd you know, when I heard Schiff’s phony version, and when I heard what was being horribly said by this so-called whistleblower — and I’d like to find who is the person in between the whistleblower and hearing about this — the conversation?  The conversation was, I think, a perfect conversation.  But who’s the person giving this information?\nIf that person exists — I’m not sure that person exists — but I think it’s important — and I say this to Congress — I think it’s important to find out who that person is, because we could have a spy.  And I don’t want to have spies when I’m negotiating with China and Syria and all of the countries — if you look at Turkey, with Erdoğan.  I have calls with all these people.  And Kim Jong Un.\nI don’t want to have spies in the White House.  I want to be free to make calls.  I don’t think it’s fair that somebody interprets a call.  He didn’t interpret it wrong; I don’t mind a misinterpretation.  This was a fraud, because that call was perfect.  And if you read the whistleblower’s report, that was no — it bore no resemblance to what the call was.\nSteve?\nQ    Could we go back to your conversation with Boris Johnson?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    There was a case involving a car crash involving a —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I hate the case.  I —\nQ    — American diplomat’s wife.  Did you bring —  did you talk about that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s true.  I — we talked about it.\nQ    What did you decide?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So, what we’re going to do — it’s a very, very complex issue, as you know, because we’re talking about diplomatic immunity, which, in itself, is quite a subject, right?  You people could lecture me on it, I suspect.  But it’s quite a subject.\nA terrible accident occurred.  The person driving the car — they know who it was, and they have it on camera.  A young man was killed on his motorcycle.  He was killed — sounds like instantly killed.\nThe woman, through diplomatic immunity, left the UK, and came back to America.  And what I’m going to try and do and see — because I understand where the people from the UK are.  And, frankly, a lot of Americans feel the same way.  We have — I was telling Boris, we have a lot of Americans that, you know, they side on the fact that, you know, you have two wonderful parents that lost their son, and the woman was driving on the wrong side of the road.\nAnd that can happen.  You know, those are the opposite roads.  That happens.  I won’t say it ever happened to me, but it did.  When you get used to driving on our system and then you’re all of a sudden in the other system, where you’re driving — it happens.  Have to be careful — very careful.\nSo a young man was killed, the person that was driving the automobile has diplomatic immunity.  We’re going to speak to her very shortly and see if we can do something where they meet — it was an accident.  It was an acc- —\nQ    Like send her back?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It was a terrible accident.\nQ    Send her back, you mean, for trial?  Or —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’re going to speak to her and we’re going to see the person driving the car — the wife of the diplomat.  We’re going to speak to her and see what we can come up with so that there can be some healing.  There’s tremendous anger over it.  It’s a terrible incident.  There’s tremendous anger, and I understand the anger from the other side very much.\nQ    Mr. President, when you met with Robert Mueller in May of 2017 at the Oval Office, were you in fact interviewing him for the position of FBI?  And were you aware, at the time that he was in the Oval Office, that he had had prior conversations with Rod Rosenstein about potentially becoming Special Counsel?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Okay, to you second question: Absolutely not.  I had no idea that he was doing that.  To the first question, he absolutely wanted to become the FBI Director, and I said, “No.”  I said, “Listen, you’ve been there for…” — I believe it was 12 years.  And I said, “No.”  And it has since been proven that I was right.  Plus, we have witnesses to it.  I interviewed numerous people that day.  And he was one of the numerous people.  Making a decision ultimately — but he was one of the people.  I said no — nicely, respectfully.\nQ    Did you speak to him about a potential conflict of interest because of the dispute he had with you over the golf membership?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I knew about it.  We didn’t speak about that, because I wasn’t going to accept him.  That may have been one of the reasons I said no.  Who knows?  But I did have conflicts of interest with Robert Mueller.  We had a business dispute.  I thought we had, as you know, three basic conflicts of interest, and none of them were very good.  But we had a — we had a business dispute.\nBut I thought he was there for 12 years.  That was long enough, especially when you saw what happened with the FBI.\nAnd you have to understand, nobody respects the FBI more than do.  And I think, if you took a vote in the EBI, they’d vote me President right now — a vast, vast majority.  And they’re great people.  I know a lot of them.  But your leadership was terrible, whether it was Comey or Mueller or anybody.\nI mean, this leadership turned out to be a disaster for this country, when you look at Strzok and Page, when you look at the “insurance policy.”  “You know, she’s going to win.  But just in case she doesn’t, we have an insurance policy.”  Well, that only means one thing; there’s no other interpretation.\nSo when you look at that — no, Robert Mueller wanted a job to be the Director, and I turned him — very nicely, respectfully — down.  The other element of your question: I never — I never heard that until just recently when it’s being reported a little bit.\nQ    So these trade — the trade talks —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Please.  Go ahead, Steve.\nQ    — coming up with China: Are you optimistic that some sort of deal will be reached with these —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, China wants to make a deal.  In my opinion, China wants to make a deal more than I do, okay?  But — but — look, I’m very happy right now.  We’re taking in billions of dollars of tariffs.  And despite what the news was saying, there’s no inflation.  There’s not a very big price increase, if any, because they’ve eaten the tariffs.  They’ve devalued their currency and they’re pouring a lot of money into their system.\nNow, they’ve lost three and a half million jobs and their chain is breaking up; their supply chain is breaking up like a broken egg.  They want to make a deal.\nThe question is: Do I want to make a deal?  And the answer would be, if we make the right deal, I’d love to do it.  I think it would be a great thing for China, also.\nQ    But they seem to be reluctant to make concessions on IP and (inaudible) —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’ll see.  I mean, you don’t know that.  Look, there is so many false reports. Everybody is trying to guess.  But there’s really only two people that matter on this one, and that’s President Xi and myself.  We get along very well.\nI can’t imagine he likes me the way he did when I first became President, because, you know, it’s been — it’s been a rough time for China.  China has gone down many trillions of dollars and we’ve gone up many trillions of dollars.  I mean, we’ve — since I’ve been elected, many, many, many trillions of dollars have been — increased the value of — if you call it “value”; you could call it “worth” or “value” — of our country.  We’ve you’ve increased — not just stock market, I’m talking our country.  Our economy is bigger.  It’s stronger.\nAnd I believe if my opponent got in, you would have had a tremendous slide.  And don’t forget, I only look at our numbers from the day after the election, because there was euphoria when I got elected and we picked up a tremendous amount from, let’s say, the 9th of November to January 20th, when we had the inauguration.  And it’s been that way ever sense.  It’s been a fantastic thing.\nBut China wants to make a deal very badly.  And if we can make a deal, we’re going to make a deal.  There’s a really good chance.  There’s a really good chance, Steve.\nQ    Have you spoken — have you spoken at all, Mr. President, to the Attorney General about the coming Horowitz Inspector General’s report and/or the Durham report — either investigation?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I really — I’m leaving that to the Attorney General — highly respected man, a very highly principled man.  I did read the Comey report — 78 pages of total kill.  And I think it says, frankly, a lot to the Attorney General that he decided not to prosecute on that report, because I think most people reading that report would have done that.  That report was horrible for Comey.  Horrible.  But he’s a highly principled man, and I’m leaving it up to him.\nQ    Mr. President, can you tell us what you said to President Erdoğan on Sunday when he said to you — did you promise him anything or did he promise you anything on Sunday?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, we’re talking about it.  No.  But he said, “I want to go in.  I want to go in.”  But he’s been telling me that for two and a half years.\nQ    And did you agree to that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He’s been telling that, virtually — he’s been saying this for many years, before me.  And, you know, he’s ready to do it.  They’ve been, again, fighting for so long.  They’ve been fighting for so many — these are — this is like Israel and the Palestinians, okay?  There’s only one difference: maybe the hatred is even greater.  Is that possible?  Maybe not.  But it’s — this is a very, very serious hatred that’s come over many years.\nYes, sir.\nQ    But, Mr. President, the Kurds helped the U.S. defeat ISIS.  And, by allowing this offensive, is it going to be more difficult in future times of need to develop alliances?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, it won’t be.  It won’t be at all.  Alliances are very easy.\nBut, you know, our alliances have taken advantage of us.  If you look at how much money we spent on NATO and how much money countries from Europe — who are really a much bigger beneficiary that we are, okay?  You know, they’re there and we’re here.  We’re many miles away.  Our alliances, in many cases, have taken tremendous advantage of us.\nIf you look at NATO, I got them to pay $100 billion more.  The Secretary-General, Stoltenberg, came out with a report recently that, because of President Trump, the other countries — 28 countries — so 27, not including us — they paid over $100 billion more because of me.  But still, as good as that is — sounds good — it’s nothing compared to the kind of numbers you’re talking about.\nSo I’m very happy with that, but the United States is paying over 4 percent and Germany is paying 1 percent — maybe a tiny bit more, but I actually think, the way you calculate it — because you can look at it many ways — is probably less than 1 percent.  France is paying less than what they’re supposed to.\nOut of the 28 countries, 20 of them are delinquent.  You know what the “delinquent” means?  That’s an old real estate term.  “He’s delinquent with his rent.”  They’re delinquent with their payment.  They owe us a tremendous amount of money and they never pay us back.\nBecause if Germany doesn’t pay — they don’t add that up, they just say, “Oh, that’s okay.”  Then they don’t pay.  And yet, they’re — if you go back that way, like the old fashioned way –like you don’t pay and you owe it.  But they don’t pay and they just go on to the next year.  They owe us hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars.  So, no.  I don’t look at it that way.\nNow, the Kurds are fighting for their land, just so you understand.  They’re fighting for their land.  And, as somebody wrote in a very, very powerful article today, they didn’t help us in the Second World War.  They didn’t help us with Normandy, as an example.  They mentioned names of different battles.  They were there, but they’re there to help us with their land.  And that’s a different thing.\nIn addition to that, we have spent tremendous amounts of money on helping the Kurds — in terms of ammunition, in terms of weapons, in terms of money, in terms of pay.  With all of that being said, we like the Kurds.\nNow you have different factions in there.  Again, you have PKK — that’s a different faction.  And they worked with us.  It’s a rough group, but they worked with us.  But we’ve spent a tremendous — and they’re fighting for their lands.  So when you say, “They’re fighting with us” — yes, but they’re fighting for their land.\nNow, if we go on the theory that some of the folks in Washington go by — who all do very well with the military-industrial complex.  I mean, you know, the military-industrial complex.  Take a look at Dwight Eisenhower; he had it figured right many years ago.   It’s got tremendous power.  They like fighting.  They make a lot of money when they fight.\nBut it was time to bring our soldiers back home.  So I see — and I will tell you: The hardest thing I have to do, by far, much harder than the witch hunt, is signing letters to parents of soldiers that have been killed.  And it’s not only that — in areas where there’s not a lot of upside, if there’s any upside at all, and in many cases, it’s only downside.\nAnd especially when that solider was killed in a Blue-on-Green attack.  You know what that is, right?  That’s where a solider being trained or whatever turns his gun on an American solider.  “Here, son.  Take your gun.  You know how to use it.”\nAnd he takes the gun and he turns it.  And he shoots one — we have many of them in Afghanistan — in particular, in Afghanistan.\nThe hardest thing I have to do is signing those letters.  That’s the hardest thing I have to do.  And each letter is different.  We make each letter different.  And last week, I signed of them for Afghanistan; one in Iraq; one in Syria, from two weeks ago.  And sometimes I call the parents.  Sometimes I see the parents.  I go to Dover, when I can, but it’s — it’s so devastating for the parents that — you know.  It’s so devastating when they bring that boy or young woman out of the back of those big, powerful planes in a coffin, and the parents are there.\nYou know, we have people that do that.  That’s what they do.  They — they work that.  They accommodate everybody.  That’s what they do.  They an incredible job.  And they said — I said, “The parents seemed to be okay.”  I’ll get there early.  “The parents seemed to be okay.”  “Well, actually, sir, they aren’t.”  “No, no.  The way they’re talking.  They’re really okay, aren’t they?”  “Sir, you never know until the back of that massive cargo plane opens up.”  And they walk down holding a coffin with four or five great soldiers on each side of it, representing our various forces.  That you never know.\nAnd then I see it.  And I see people that were smiling, “Oh, Mr. President, thank you for being here.  Thank you for being here.”  And I think they’re doing great.  And then, twenty minutes later, we’ll be outside when that big plane pulls up and that door comes down, and they are walking the coffin with their boy inside this coffin with an American flag over the top.  And they’re walking that coffin down this ramp.  And I’ve seen people that I thought were really incredible the way they were ta- — I didn’t even understood how they could take it so well — scream, like I’ve never seen anything before.  Sometimes they’ll run to the coffin.  They’ll break through military barriers.  They’ll run to the coffin and jump on top of the coffin.  Crying mothers and wives.  Crying desperately.\nAnd this is on these endless wars that just never stop.  And there’s a time and there’s a place, but it’s time to stop.\nAnd just to finish, last Friday, I went to Walter Reed.  And I gave out five Purple Hearts to incredible young men — in this case, all men.  And they took a beating.  Beautiful people.  They took a beating.  One couldn’t be there because the beating was so great that he was at a totally different part of the world.  He lost a leg.  He lost an arm.  Ryan.  He had tremendous damage, beyond even what these young folks went through.\nBut I’ll tell you what: For me, it’s very hard when I see that.  It’s very hard.  It’s easy to talk tough.  You know, tough guys.  All of these tough guys.  “Let’s keep fighting.  Let’s keep fighting.”  If they had to go to Walter Reed — where they do unbelievable work.  I have to tell you, these doctors are unbelievable.  You know, it’s easy to say, “Oh, they’re not the…”  They’re the best in the world.  I’ve never seen anything like it.\nOne young man, last week, had his nose rebuilt.  And they said it was in a thousand pieces.  And, I said, “So where were you hurt?”  He said, “My face, sir, was almost obliterated.”  I said, “You have a better face than I do.”  (Laughter.)  And he said, “Sir, I had a doctor who was unbelievable, and they put it together.”  They said — he said “a thousand fragments.”  Now, I don’t if that’s even possible.  But a thousand fragments.  And they put it together.\nAnd his father, who was crying, came up to me and said, “You’re not going to believe this, but my son didn’t have a great-looking nose and now his nose is better.”  (Laughter.)  Okay?  It’s an amazing thing.\nBut when you see these — and the Purple Hearts — you see this kind of thing — and I see a lot of it at Walter Reed.  And, again, the job those doctors and the people do at Walter Reed, it’s something to be commended.\nThank you all very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nEND\n4:39 P.M.

        "text": "Oval Office4:47 P.M. EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  And I want to thank everybody for being here.  This is a very special event.  Today, it’s my tremendous privilege to present our nation’s highest civilian honor to a absolute titan of American law and a heroic defender of the American Constitution: former Counselor to the President and Attorney General of the United States, Ed Meese.  Very special man.  (Applause.)\nEd, congratulations on receiving a really incredible award.  This is something that — we have the Congressional Medal of Honor and we have the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  And this is something that’s very special for me to present it to you.  I’ve heard so many incredible things over the years about you.  So, congratulations.  It’s my honor to be with you.\nWe’re delighted to be joined by Vice President Mike Pence; Attorney General William Barr — Bill; Acting OMB Director Russ Vought; and Heritage Foundation President Kay Cole James.  Hi, Kay.  Also — he did a good job, didn’t he?  (Laughter.)  Huh?\nAlso with us is Ed’s terrific family: his wife of 61 years, Ursula.  Thank you, Ursula.\nMRS. MEESE:  You’re welcome.  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s a long time.  Good husband, right?  (Laughter.)  He was a good husband.\nMRS. MEESE:  First 38 years.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  At least for the first 38 years.  (Laughter.)\nAlong with his children, grandchildren, and his great grandson, Liam.  I know you.  Huh?  (Laughter.)  He grabbed me.  I said, “I like this guy.”  Good.  Thank you for being here.\nEd Meese was born into a deeply patriotic family committed to public service.  His father worked in local government for five decades, including many years as police court clerk.  His dad’s stories of — I mean, and he had some incredible stories, from what I was told.  His stories of serving the people of Oakland inspired Ed’s lifetime of passion.  And his law enforcement career was unparalleled.\nAfter graduating from Yale in 1953, Ed attended the University of California at Berkeley Law School and served two years of active duty in the United States Army.  He remained in the Reserves for another two and a half decades, retiring as a Colonel in 1984.  I didn’t know that, Ed.  That was pretty good, right?\nEd married Ursula, the love of his life, in 1958.  And they wanted me to say that, and he meant it.  Truly, the love of his life.  That’s a beautiful thing.\nHe then became Deputy District Attorney of Alameda County, California, the same county where he had grown up.  He regularly rode with local police on patrol.  One officer later said about Ed, “Finding someone around here who doesn’t like Ed Meese is like trying to find a four-year-old who doesn’t like Santa Claus.”  (Laughter.)  So, in other words, he was a popular guy.\nWhen chaos and violence broke out on the campus of UC Berkeley, Ed was instrumental in restoring order, peace, and public safety.\nIn 1966, still the deputy district attorney of his native county, Ed was introduced to Governor-elect Ronald Reagan for the first time.  At the end of a 30-minute one-on-one meeting, the new governor offered Ed a job.  He said, “This guy has the potential to be great.”\nEd joined the administration as Legal Affairs Secretary and quickly earned Governor Reagan’s trust.  Just two years later, he became Chief of Staff.  In that position, Ed worked tirelessly to serve the people of California.  He helped negotiate the first major welfare reform in the nation, fought for the Governor’s legislative priority, and helped propel Ronald Reagan onto a national stage.  And it was a stage that was a truly great one; he became a great President.\nAfter Governor Reagan narrowly lost the 1976 presidential primary campaign, Ed joined the faculty of San Diego University Law School and became the founding director of its Center for Criminal Justice Policy and Management.\nIn 1980, Ed became a key leader in Ronald Reagan’s presidential campaign.  And Ed knew that was going to happen; it was just a question of time.  After Reagan’s victory that November, he oversaw the presidential transition.\nIn the new administration, Ed was appointed Counselor to the President and was the only White House staff member included in President Reagan’s Cabinet.  In that position, he drove sweeping reforms of the executive branch and ensured the departments worked together to achieve the administration’s goals.  And he was a star.\nEd was among President Reagan’s closest advisors as the administration implemented tax cuts, a dramatic defense build-up, and a relentless campaign to defeat communism.  Ed helped spearhead an initiative to fight organized crime and public corruption, supported a task force on victims of crime, and chaired the first White House meeting on missile defense that led to the Strategic Defense Initiative — a strategy that helped win the Cold War.\nIn 1984, President Reagan nominated Ed Meese to be Attorney General.  We have our Attorney General with us, and he’s also doing a great job, I will tell you that.  (Applause.)\nIn the course of a grueling nomination process, he showed incredible grace and grit.  The Democrats tried to derail his nomination, but Ed stayed strong.  And after 13 months, he was finally confirmed.  That sounds like the kind of things we go through.  (Laughter.)  You know, if you get — if you win by one vote today, it’s like considered a landslide.  That sounds no different.  Boy, things don’t change very much, do they?  Do they, Kay?  I don’t think so.\nOver the next three years, Ed would deliver monumental change for the American people.  As Attorney General, Ed led the battle against drugs.  He aggressively targeted traffickers and their assets.  He also chaired the National Drug Policy Board and coordinated the administration’s response to the drug crisis.\nIn the years that followed, the strategy proved successful.  Between 1982 and 1992, drug use by young adults plummeted by 50 percent nationwide.  Would you like to make a comeback?  That’s a pretty good number.  (Laughter.)  You know, we’ve got it down 18 percent, but I like 50 percent better.  But we’re dealing with a whole new set of drugs, unfortunately.  It’s getting — it’s a very tough situation.\nPerhaps Ed’s greatest contribution to American law has been his unwavering advocacy for the legal principle that judges must adhere to the original meaning of the Constitution, setting aside their own personal and political views.\nThrough the decades, Ed has been one of the most eloquent champions for following the Constitution as written.  To ensure fidelity to our founding documents, Ed supported the growth of the Federalist Society and worked to confirm supremely qualified judges, including the late, great Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, whose son just became the Secretary — you know that — Secretary of Labor.  Gene.  Just had him in, and it was a great ceremony we had.\nAfter concluding a historic tenure as Attorney General, Ed joined the Heritage Foundation.  Over his 30 years at Heritage, he helped create the Foundation’s Legal and Judicial Studies Department, which is now named in his honor.  And we’re talking about judges.  And I will say, Heritage has been very helpful with us also, as you know.  And I just had, on that desk, a little while ago, another six.  And we’ll be up to, very soon, about 182 federal judges and 2 Supreme Court judges.  That’s not including two Supreme Court.  So we really — (applause) — we really have made tremendous strides.  It’s a number that few people have been able to even come close to.  So, it’s great.  And we appreciate all the work you’ve done, too, Kay.\nEd has advocated for effective law enforcement against over-criminalization, and is always in defense of the Constitution and the system of government designed by our Founders.\nEd, you are a loyal fighter for freedom, a champion of law and order, mentor to young Americans, and faithful defender of our Republic.  You are an inspiration to liberty-loving citizens everywhere.  You’re just an inspiration, period.  Everybody that knows you uses that word: You’re an inspiration.  On behalf of the grateful nation that I love and that we serve, I want to thank you.  I want to thank you for your incredible lifetime of exceptional service and of devotion to our country.\nAnd I just want to say to your family that this is an extraordinary man, and I looked at all of your wonderful children and grandchildren and your great-grandson and you.  I’m especially talking about you.  (Laughter.)  You have very good genes.  Just remember the President — you have great genes between the two of them.  Okay?  Great genes.\nSo it is now my honor to ask the military aide to come forward and present Edwin Meese III with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  Thank you.  Congratulations, Ed.  (Applause.)  Ed, I think we may — we’ll do this first.  Okay?\nMILITARY AIDE:  Edwin Meese III has long been thought — a thought leader and strong conservative voice on matters of law and policy.  As Counselor to President Ronald Reagan, Mr. Meese helped to craft the foreign policy strong enough to help end the Cold War and played a pivotal role in helping to secure historic tax cuts.\nAs Attorney General, he promoted federalism and the original public understanding of our Constitution.\nSince leaving public service, Edwin Meese has continued to champion our nation’s founding principles through his extensive work at the Heritage Foundation.\nThe United States proudly honors Edwin Meese III, who has dedicated his life to serving our nation and protecting our liberties.\n(The Medal of Freedom is presented.)  (Applause.)\nMR. MEESE:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you very much both for this very fine award — an award which I will cherish, obviously, forever — but also for the kind words that you gave and what you have mentioned, but particularly for the privilege of being here with you and to have my family here to meet you and also to listen to this particular ceremony.\nIt’s just a great privilege that I appreciate very much, and appreciate all that you have done to make us welcome here, and, as I say, for those kind words.\nI’m also very grateful to the Vice President for being here.  Mr. Vice President, you and I have been friends since the day you were in Congress here, not so many years ago.  And it was great to have known you and followed your career also.  And I think you and the President make one of the finest teams we’ve had in our country.  And I’m very grateful particularly to have this award coming from the two of you.  And I thank you.  (Applause.)\nI also want to mention Bill Barr, and I thank you, Bill, for this.  You and I started work together in the first term of Ronald Reagan; you were in the Office of Policy Development.  And you’ve risen to continue the string of great Attorneys General in this country, and I certainly appreciate what you’re doing now.  I must say, from my own experience, I understand what you’re going through now.  (Laughter.)  So it’s even better to wish you well in the fine work you’re doing.  (Applause.)\nMr. President, I’m also really honored by the members of your administration who are here today.  As I look around, I see so many good friends here.  I can’t name them all or it would take up the rest of the afternoon, but so many of them and so many who’ve I’ve appreciated the chance to work with as I look around.  And, really, I’m very honored that you would all come out to see this particular ceremony.\nAs I stand here today, I can’t do anything other than to thank and praise God for the opportunities and the blessings that I have received in the course of my life.  And, of course, one of the greatest blessings in my life has been wife, as you point out, of over 60 years, who is with me today and who is my best friend, a partner in everything I have done, and a great teammate.  Particularly, I attribute to her the handsome family of kids we have here.  (Laughter.)\nAnd also, to my whole family.  Family has been my foundation throughout our married life, and it’s just great to see and to be with all of them today.  And, Mr. President, you honor me by allowing them to participate in this particular event.  And, you know, it’s just great to know that we have here today four generations of Meeses.  And so, it’s a great, great honor to have them here.\nYou spoke about the privilege that I had of working for Ronald Reagan.  And I will always be indebted to him not only for the honor he did by having me honored — or appointed to serve under his leadership for 30 years, from 1967, when I first served, as you pointed out, as his Legal Affairs Secretary, to 1997, when he went into the social — total security — total isolation, really.  And I had that privilege to work for him in the state of California; here, as you pointed out, obviously in Washington, D.C.; and then following that both in the building of his library and then — and today, I still have the privilege — in the Young America’s Foundation, they now have taken over his ranch in Santa Barbara, and I have the privilege of serving as the co-chairman of that Ranch Board of Governors.  So Ronald Reagan was a pivotal part of my life, and I am always grateful to him.\nBut, you know, the things that you mentioned — and you were very kind and generous in all that you said — the things that you mentioned are something that I could not have done by myself.  I was always very lucky to have a team of people that I was able to work with.  And over the period of time, I can’t think of better people than anyone could have as teammates and people participating in the work of the United States of America, both obviously in my early days, but particularly over the last 30-some-odd years as I was privileged to work here in Washington, D.C.\nOne person who has been a friend, a counselor, literally, and also a great teammate has been Ken Cribb, who is here today.  And he has — (applause) — Ken has always been there by my side and giving me excellent advice and help, and, as they say today, always having my back.  And I am very grateful, Ken.\nAnother person who was with me — and who will join me — in the Department of Justice — two people, actually, that are here today that I want to mention: One is Mark Levin.  This was before he became famous.  (Laughter and applause.)\nHe was just kind of a young, mild-young — you know, easygoing, young man.  (Laughter.)  And we’re happy to have him here with his wife, Julie.\nAnd a third one was Becky Dunlop who was in the Department of Justice with me and did a terrific job.  (Applause.)  So it’s great to have them.\nAnd, of course, Bob McEwen, who is here, has been an advisor and a helper to me in the conservative movement, and an inspiration, as well as a great teammate.\nAnd then, also, it is great because, as you pointed out when I was privileged — when I left the government in 19- — the end of 1988, I was privileged to be asked to join the Heritage family,  And under Kay’s leadership, and Kim Holmes, and now today with John Malcolm heading up the legal center, and with Bridgett Wagner, who is here — Becky was with us there — we’ve had a — just had a great time and a great team of people that I was privileged to work with there.\nIt’s been just a great thing for me to have all of these opportunities, as I mentioned earlier.  And it’s — I’m very grateful to all of those people that are here.\nI also am grateful to another guest, our pastor, Pastor Bill Barr — Bill Mann.  Bill Mann has been a great spiritual leader for our family, and I’m grateful very much for that.\nI’m just — as I say, there’s so many things to be grateful for today.  And the only thing that I would do, Mr. President, is mention a couple of things that particularly are meaningful to me.  You’ve done so many things, but there are three things that have been particularly meaningful.  You’ve mentioned one of them, and that it your commitment to the Constitution and your commitment to making sure that it’s interpreted as it actually reads.  And for that, you have appointed these outstanding judges now, which is a monument to justice and the rule of law that will last literally — literally, for decades.  And I’m grateful for that.\nThe second thing is your emphasis on religious liberty.  Your speech to the United Nations was, I believe, the first by any President to talk about that subject before this august buddy — body.  And there’s no group that needed that encouragement more on that particular subject.  (Laughter.)\nAnd finally, I am grateful and Ursula is grateful, because of our family, for your support for the Armed Forces of the United States.  You have not only given them leadership, you’ve given them the resources they need, but you’ve gone beyond that.  You have shown your personal respect for every man and woman in uniform.  And that’s something that really is not only good for them, but also for their families so that their families can see the dignity that you appreciate in the work that our military folks are doing.\nAll of these things are very important to us.  And as a result, today I couldn’t be happier and I couldn’t be more grateful to any person for what you’ve given us here today.  Thank you, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Ed.  That’s so nice.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Beautiful.\nWell, you know, you’re right about Mark; he has become a star.  Maybe I’d like to have Mark say a few words and the Attorney General say a few words, and our Vice President say a few words.  Could we do that?  Come on up first, Mark.  Just nice and easy now, Mark.  Nice — (laughter).  Good.\nMR. LEVIN:  Well, it’s a great honor to be here with two great men, President Trump and Attorney General Meese.  And it was an honor to work for you as Special Assistant, then Chief of Staff, through the good, the bad, and the ugly.\nAnd you accomplished many, many things as Attorney General of the United States.  And you’ve always been wonderful to my family, you and Ursula.  You’re family to us, and you always will be.  And this is a great honor, and I can’t think of a better person to receive it.\nAnd, Mr. President, I want to thank you — (laughter) — I want to thank you for everything you’re doing for this country.  I’ve known two great Presidents: Ronald Reagan and you.  And I’m sorry you’re going through what you’re going through, but I want you to know there’s tens of millions of people who stand with you.  So, God bless you.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Bill?  Mike?  Come up.  Come up.  Please.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And it really is my great honor to serve alongside this President and to be able to share this moment with you, Attorney General Meese, and with your wonderful family.\nIt is extraordinary to think of the life of consequence that you have lived, coming alongside one American President, but also being there every step of the way as this President brought forward a vision to rebuild our military, revive our economy, reground the courts of this country to constitutional principles of limited government.\nAnd on behalf of the President and on behalf of a grateful nation, it’s my honor to add my congratulations to you on the President Medal of Freedom.  Congratulations.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody.  (Applause.)\nEND\n5:11 P.M.

        "text": "Cabinet Room6:15 P.M. EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much, everybody.  This is a group gathering of very talented people.  And somebody was saying before, I think Mark Esper, our new Secretary of Defense — and, by the way, congratulations.\nSECRETARY ESPER:  Thank you, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Congratulations on really having done already a really great job.  But you were saying this is the first group where just about everybody — they’re appointed by Trump.  And that’s good.  That’s good.  Just about everybody.  So we have the people that we want.  We’re very happy with them.\nOur military is in great shape.  I want to — in particular, I want to congratulate Mark for new — the new boss, right?  You’re the new boss.  And it’s some somebody that’s respected by everybody in this room and respected by just about everybody outside of this room, I can tell you.  So, Joint Chiefs of Staff.  The head is — that’s — it doesn’t get any bigger in your world.\nBut we are having a meeting tonight.  We have a meeting now, and then we’re going to the White House and we’re going to have dinner with the wives and families.  And we’re going to have some very interesting conversation.\nThings are going very well with our military.  We’ve spent $2.5 trillion since I’ve been President, and rebuilt our military.  When I came in, we were low on ammunition and, as you know, we had jets that didn’t work too well.  We had a lot of — a lot of old planes, and we have now, beautiful new planes, or certainly we have a lot of them coming, but we have a lot of them right now in stock.\nAnd we’re — we’re doing things I think that nobody thought was possible.  We have had extraordinary relationships with a lot of our allies and, I would say, good relationships with others.  But we want fairness, we want — we want to be treated respectfully.  We help a lot of nations, and they are not — they’re not sometimes there for us.  So we want to help the ones that — that we want, and we want to help the ones that deserve the help.  And I think we’ve discussed this at length, all of us.  Perhaps there’ll be some changes made, and perhaps not.  But we have to be respected as a nation.\nA lot of things are changing.  You have some very, very wealthy nations, extremely wealthy nations, where we take care of their military and we take care of their military needs.  Nobody can do it better than us.  But we are really not being reimbursed for what we’re doing.\nAnd we’re having some very nice talks, very friendly talks.  And for the most part, I would say, without exception, people are coming through and they’re saying, “You know, we have to help out also.”\nSo a lot of very exciting things are happening with our military.  We have a great team.  This is our team right here.  They’re some of the best leaders in the world.  I think they’re probably the best leaders in the world.  We have the greatest men, we have the greatest women, and we have the greatest equipment.  Nobody makes it like we do.\nSo I just want to thank you all.  We’ll have a discussion.  Then we’re going to go over and have dinner at the White House. And thank you all very much for being here.  Appreciate it.\nQ    Mr. President, are you confident that — are you confident that these gentlemen — I guess, mostly who are sitting around you — believe what you’re doing in Syria is the best idea at this point?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’ve been in Syria for a long time.\nAnd it was supposed to be a very short hit, and — hit on ISIS.  But it didn’t work out that way.  They never left.  And they’ve been there for many, many years.  And we are — we were down to very few soldiers in Syria.  We had 50 in the region that you’re talking about — 50 soldiers — and they’ve been already moved out.\nBut we’ll see what happens with respect to a lot of different things.  We’ve told Turkey — I spoke with President Erdoğan of Turkey, and I said, “Got to treat them good, and you got to take care of ISIS.”  Don’t forget, we’ve captured — we defeated — this group, largely — defeated ISIS.  One hundred percent of the caliphate.  One hundred percent.  And we wanted to do 100 percent.  I was going to do this nine months ago, and we were not at 100 percent, but we were pretty close.  Everyone said, “Can we get to 100 percent?”  Now I get to 100 percent, and they say, “Well, maybe we could stay longer.”  I say, “Well, when do we get out?”  There’s got to be a time we get out.  We have to bring our people back home.\nAnd frankly, our great soldiers have been talking about this on the campaign.  You go back three years ago and more, and you watch the speeches.  We want to bring our soldiers back home.  These are the endless wars.\nAnd we’re not fighting; we’re policing, to a large extent.  We’re policing in certain areas.  We’re not police, we’re — these are fighters, great fighters; the greatest in the world.  And that’s what they do.\nSo I’ve told President Erdoğan — I hope he’s going to treat everybody with great respect.  You have to understand, they’ve been fighting various of the people that we were working with, and they — Turkey has been fighting them for many years.  Somebody said hundreds of years.  You had just mentioned to me yesterday, 200 years, maybe more.\nAt some point, we have to bring our people back home.  And that’s what we’re doing.  That’s what we’re doing.\nQ    Is it a firm decision, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s always a firm decision.  Last time I made a firm decision, but — and I said, “We’ll do it over a period of time.”  We’ve been doing this, actually, over a period of time — over a very long period of time.  And we’ve been working with the people in this room, and our soldiers have been coming back over that period of time.\nI think that one of the very big factors when we defeated ISIS — we have thousands right now, of ISIS fighters and families.  We have family members, wives, children.  And many of them come out of Europe, they come out of Germany, they come out of France and other countries of Europe, and I told them, “You have to take these people back.”  You have to take them back, give them trials, do whatever you have to do.  And they said, “No, we don’t want to do that.  I said, “Well, you have to do that.”  That’s not fair to the American taxpayers.  It’s not fair to America.  It’s not fair to the United States not to do that.  But they chose not to do it.  I said, “Again, you got to take them back.”  We can’t take care of sixty, seventy thousand  people.\nAnd we’re not going to move the fighters to Guantanamo Bay and take care of them for many, many years into the future.  It’s not for us.  We did you a great service, a great favor.  We defeated the caliphate 100 percent, and now it’s time for Germany and France, and all of the nations where they came from, to take them back.  And they chose no.  And maybe they’ll — maybe they’re going to change their tune now.  I don’t know.\nBut in the meantime, we’ll have to rely on the European nations.  We’ll have to rely on various other nations — as an example, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Russia, and some other nations — to take care of these fighters.  But the American taxpayer is not going to spend 50 years of paying tax, or whatever it may be that they’re — wherever they may be, for instance, Guantanamo, or, for instance, prisons in the United States.  The American taxpayer won’t put up with that.\nQ    Mr. President, are you concerned with what the second whistleblower may reveal about your conversation with Ukraine?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Not at all, because the call was a perfect call.  You had stenographers, you had people that took it down exactly.  It was a perfect call.  It’s just a scam.  This is a scam by the Democrats to try and win an election that they’re not going to win in 2020.\nAll you have to do is take a look at the polls, see what happened.  One poll had me up 12 points, 16 points, or 17 points.\nWe — just take a look at what’s going on.  The people understand it’s a scam.  They’re trying to win an election in 2020 by using impeachment.  If you look at that call, it’s a perfect call.  It’s congenial.  There was no pressure.  And what did the head of Ukraine say?  What did the head — did he say there was no pressure?  Did his person say — his top representative, his foreign minister, say there was no pressure whatsoever.  There was no pressure put on him.  This is a scam.  This is one of the greatest scams we —\nLook, we beat you on the — we won on the Mueller scam.  That was a whole big deal.  That lasted for two and a half years.  We had a few days of peace and then, all of a sudden, they came up with this one.  But I guess it’s just part of my life.  This is the most ridiculous thing many people have ever seen.  All you have to do is read.  All you have to do is read what they wrote down, the stenographers.  They wrote down an exact call.\nNow, what happened is Schiff, Adam Schiff, went up before Congress, and he read the most horrible speech, attributed the speech to me.  These people won’t believe this one.  If you went to Annapolis, West Point, or the Air Force Academy, you’re not going to believe this one happened.  He went up, and he took a speech, and he made it up.  It was horrible.  And he said, “The President of the United States said this on the call.”  It’s a fraud.  He real- — I mean, it’s a fraudulent speech.  What he did is incredible.  And it shouldn’t be allowed.  And I don’t think it’s going to be allowed.  I think a lot of things are happening.\nBy the way, Nancy Pelosi knew it was a fraud, and she didn’t say anything about it.  But if you look at the call — you just take a look at that call — that call is a very — a terrific call.  It’s congenial, there was no pressure, there was no anything.  And you know it, and so do I, and so does everybody else.  And that’s why the polls are doing well.  That’s why — I don’t bring up fundraising, but that’s why, I believe, in the history of the Republican Party at this time, they’ve never had anything like the numbers that have been raised.  They raised $13 million in many small donations in a 24-hour period.  That hasn’t even happened.\nSo, people understand that it’s a fraud.  It’s a scam.  It’s a witch hunt.  And all we do is just keep fighting for the American people, because that’s all I do.\nWe win.  Our economy is doing great.  Our jobs numbers are the best they’ve ever been.  Just about the best they’ve ever been for many groups: African Americans, Asians, Hispanics. They’re the best they’ve ever been in the history of our country.  And overall, they’re the best numbers in 51 years.\nSo, we’re doing great things and we’re going to keep going.  Thank you very much.\nEND\n6:25 P.M.

EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much everybody.  I want to start by wishing my very good friend, Prime Minister Abe of Japan, a very happy birthday.   He’s 39 years old today.  (Laughter.)  So please extend my wishes to the Prime Minister.  He’s a great gentleman and we have had tremendous success.\nAs you know, in addition to what we’re talking about today, they’re building — Japan — many car plants in the United States, which they weren’t doing for a long time.  And they’re building in Michigan, Ohio, lots of different states.  And we just appreciate it very much.  Been a tremendous investment.\nBut we’re here to talk about a little bit of a different purchase, and that’s good as far as we’re concerned.  And I want to thank you very much.  Very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nSo we’re gathered here today at the White House this afternoon to discuss a very strong and groundbreaking achievement for the United States and Japan: the signing of the new U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement and the U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement.  Digital is becoming a very big factor in the world.\nThese two deals represent a tremendous victory for both of our nations.  They will create countless jobs, expand investment and commerce, reduce our trade deficit very substantially, promote fairness and reciprocity, and unlock the vast opportunities for growth.\nIn the United States, these deals are a game changer for our farmers and our ranchers — we love our farmers and we love our ranchers; we’ve been working very hard on this — providing them with significantly enhanced access to a critical foreign market.\nIn a moment, I’ll be really honoring a lot of the folks in the room that are here with us from farm country, ranch country.  And we’re going to be witnessing a historic signing by Ambassador Robert Lighthizer and Ambassador from Japan — a long trip, but you just got here — Sugiyama of Japan.  And we’re grateful to both of you for the outstanding job you’ve done and all of the people that were involved with both of you, your staffs and your representatives.  Thank you both very much.  Bob, thank you.  Thank you very much.  It’s a lot of work.\nWe’re also delighted that Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao is here.  Where is Elaine?  (Laughter.)  Where is Elaine?  Hi, Elaine.\nSECRETARY CHAO:  Sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Great.  She’s busy.  (Laughter.)  Doing a fantastic job.  Thank you —\nSECRETARY CHAO:  Thank you, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — very much, honey.\nDeputy Secretary of Agriculture Stephen Censky is here.  Where is Stephen?\nDEPUTY SECRETARY CENSKY:  Right here.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Stephen?  Hi, Stephen.\nDEPUTY SECRETARY CENSKY:  Good you see you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Thank you very much.  Spoke to Sonny last night.  We’re doing well.\nA very great gentleman, a very popular man too, in the world and especially his wonderful state, Steve Daines.  Steve, I saw you back there.  (Applause.)  Hi, Steve.  Hi, Steve.  I also should — I saw your poll numbers.  You are strong.  (Laughter.)  You’re doing good.  And that’s a good decision by the voters, I can tell you.  Thanks, Steve.\nRepresentatives Jodey Arrington and Kevin Hern.  And thank you, fellas, for being here.  As well as, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum.  Doug, thank you.  Thank you.\nPARTICIPANT:  Over there.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Doug?  Where’s Doug?  Good, Doug.  Good job.  Say hello to your wife.\nGOVERNOR BURGUM:  I will.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  North Carolina Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest.  Hi, Dan.  Hi.  We just approved that last amount of money for the hurricane.\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR FOREST:  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You know about that, right?\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR FOREST:  Yes, Mr. President.  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Iowa Lieutenant Governor Adam Gregg.  Adam, great job.\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GREGG:  Thank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Great job.\nAnd many other state and local officials.  We have some tremendously respected people here — political people.\nI want to extend a special welcome to all of the leaders here today representing American farmers and ranchers benefitting from this deal — this is a tremendously important deal and a very big deal — including those from our beef, pork, poultry, wheat, dairy, and corn associations.\nI would particularly like to recognize Zippy.  Zippy Duvall.  He’s been with us from the beginning.  Zippy?  Zippy?\nMR. DUVALL:  Hey, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Where’s my Zippy?  Hi.  Very good.  Thank you for being here.\nMR. DUVALL:  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Zippy is always — he’s always — he’s always here trying to make good deals for your folks, right?\nMR. DUVALL:  Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He’s the President and CEO of the American Farm Bureau Federation.  And we’re doing really well.  I — in fact, we’re doing a deal with — a big deal with Japan.  But, you know, China is big — buying again.  You see that China is buying very big.\nMR. DUVALL:  We see that, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  A lot of people don’t like to talk about that, but China is in the market buying very big –agricultural.\nWe’re also joined by several senior leaders from our nation’s top technology companies, including Chris Padilla of IBM.  Hi, Chris.  How are you?  How’s IBM doing?\nMR. PADILLA:  Doing very well, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Very good.  You have a lot to do with farming, too, I know, right?\nMR. PADILLA:  We do.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  With all of those programs that you do.  Smart farming.  Very smart farming.\nPeggy Johnson of Microsoft.  Peggy, thank you very much for being here.  Please say hello, too.\nAnd Craig Albright of Business Software Alliance.  Thank you very much, Craig.  We appreciate it.\nWe do appreciate your support, and it really is now smart farming.  In fact, going to MIT doesn’t hurt either, right?  When you’re a farmer nowadays.  It’s incredible what they do.\nFrom day one, my administration has fought tirelessly to achieve a level playing field for the American worker.\nIn addition to the agreements we’re signing with Japan today, we reached a tremendous agreement with Mexico and Canada to replace NAFTA with the new USMCA.  And hopefully that’ll get done in the not-too-distant future.  Everybody wants it.  Manufacturers want it, farmers want it, even unions want it.  People want it.  And that’s a great deal for all of the countries, but in particular, it’s a great deal for us and our workers.\nWe’re also completely renegotiating — and now we’ve completed that and signed it — the U.S.-Korea Trade Agreement to substantially expanding American auto exports.  It’s made a tremendous difference.  That was a terrible agreement, and we renegotiated it and it’s now a very good agreement for the United States.  It was not a good agreement for the United States at all.\nToday’s signing of the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement and U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement builds on these incredible successes to the benefit of both of our nations.  And I have to say that, while we’re here, and because of the fact that we’re talking about agriculture, ethanol, and the farmers of Nebraska and Iowa and all of the different places that wanted it, we’ve come to an agreement.  And it’s going to be, I guess, about getting close to 16 billion barrels.  Right?  Something like that.  That’s a lot.\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GREGG:  Sixteen billion gallons.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s a lot.  Say it again.\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GREGG:  Sixteen billion gallons.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s a lot.  (Laughter.)  That’s a lot of gallons.  So I think they — so they should like me out in Iowa and all of the different places, huh?\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GREGG:  Very appreciative of your actions, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think so.\nAnd also, and very importantly, we’ve taken in tremendous amounts of money in the form of tariffs from China.  China has eaten the cost of those tariffs because they’ve devalued their currency and they’ve also pumped a lot of money into their system.  Deflation is — we have no inflation.  If anything, it’s going below the number so, therefore, we’re entitled to an interest rate cut.  I hope the Fed does that because we’d be like a rocket ship.  And we’re already the strongest economy in the world and doing better than just about any economy in the world.  And a lot of people are asking us the secret.  But we’d like to see an interest rate cut — a very substantial one.  And whatever else they want to do.  But we would be a rocket ship.\nAnd if you look at from the time I got elected — if you go to November 9th, the day after the election — we’re up close to 60 percent in the market, which is numbers that are pretty much unheard of because it’s a fairly short period of time.\nOur country is doing really well.  But we are taking care of our farmers out of the billions and billions of dollars that we’ve gotten.  You know about that Zippy, right?\nMR. DUVALL:  Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So we’re giving $12 billion from the year before — $12 billion.  And that’s compliments of China.  Thank you very much.  And $16 billion this last year.  And then we’ll see what happens next year.  Maybe by that time it’s straightened out.  But the farmers and ranchers were targeted, to put it mildly, by China.  And it’s nice that they’re coming back.\nAnd, by the way, China is also coming here on — their representatives — they’re coming on Thursday and Friday, Bob, I believe.  And so you’ll start some negotiations.  And the relationship is very good.  As to whether or not we make a deal, I don’t know.  But there’s certainly a good possibility.  But the relationship is a very good one.   But we’ve taken in billions of dollars.\nAnd of those many, many more billions, we’re giving $16 billion to our farmers because I asked Sonny Perdue — I said, “Sonny, what was the amount of money that — last year, that the farmers were hurt?”  He said, “Let me get back to you.”  He got back to me.  The number was $16 billion.  I said, “That’s okay.  We’re going to take $16 billion out of the tariffs and we’re going to give it to the American farmer.”  And I think they appreciated that.\nIt never gets reported by the “fake news,” as I say.  But it never gets reported.  Never.  I don’t know why.  They don’t want to do it.\nAnd then, Zippy, as you know, we took $12 billion from the year before.  And that also came from large amounts of tariff and — tariffs.  And people were actually saying — I read a report today, I believe in the Washington Times, where they talked about the tremendous amount of money that has actually come in from tariffs.  And it’s been a number that we’ve never even seen before in this country.  We’ve had a tremendous amount of money coming in.\nAnd some of the Republican senators — and it’s not a bad idea — said, “Why don’t we give it?”  Because we have a lot of money left over after taking care of our farmers.  And what we’re doing is we’re bringing it right up to the level that the farmers were targeted by.  So, in theory, they should be — it should be, in its own way, a level playing field.  The amazing thing about the farmer — and I’ve been with so many — they don’t even want that, right?\nMR. DUVALL:  That’s right.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They just want a level playing field.  They don’t even want $16 billion.  I think almost anybody else — Larry Kudlow — wants $16 billion.  The farmer doesn’t want it.  They want a level playing field.  They want to play the game the way it should be played.  And I think we’re probably pretty close to doing that too.  But in the meantime, no other President would get $16 billion and $12 billion for the American farmer or rancher — that I can tell you.  So —\nMR. DUVALL:  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — maybe it was your great work.  I don’t know.  Right?\nMR. DUVALL:  Your work, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It was all of us.  Everybody standing up here, frankly.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, today Japan has committed to dramatically increase market access to American food and agricultural exports.  It’s a very dramatic number.  It’s one of the larger trade deals ever signed.  As a result, 126 million Japanese consumers will have greater access to high-quality American almonds, blueberries, corn, wine, poultry, and egg products, beef, pork, wheat, and so much more.  Anything else you folks can think of?  Do you want to shout it out?  Anything?  Steve?  Anybody?  No?\nSENATOR DAINES:  Beef.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Beef.  Did I not say that?\nPARTICIPANT:  Ethanol.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Ethanol.  (Laughs.)  Yes.  (Laughter.)  That’s an interes- — let me think about that one.\nOnce this agreement enters into force, Japanese tariffs will be completely eliminated, so that Japan will not be charging us, as they have, for many, many years — and that’s — we appreciate it — and substantially reduced over 90 percent of the United States agricultural exports.  That’s a big thing because we’re getting charged a lot of tariffs.  And it’s okay for us to charge, but we can’t have other countries charge.\nOur farmers, ranchers, and growers will now be able to compete fairly in Japan against major competitors worldwide.  In addition to these agricultural agreements, the extraordinary digital agreement that we’re signing — so, that digital agreement is a very big deal in its own right — we’re signing today, sets standards on the $40 billion in digital trade between the United States and Japan.\nAnd we just won a big — talking about digital and talking about the Internet — but we just won the big case, as you know.  And you people would really know, right?  But that was a big case that we won on net neutrality.  Just won it.  And that’s a — going to receive — maybe they won’t even appeal it, because it’s a very hard case to appeal, but it was a tremendous victory in terms of speed and in terms of investment on the Internet.\nThis deal is remarkable in that it will ensure that Americans have a level playing field in trading cutting-edge products and services, such as videos, music, e-books, and software.  These comprehensive provisions meet the gold standard of digital trade rules that were set in the landmark USMCA.  And, again, we hope that’s going to get voted on.  We hope that Nancy Pelosi gets it voted on because everyone wants it, and she’ll have to make her own decision.  Let her make her own decision.  But I can tell you the American public is tired of Do-Nothing.  And we are doing a lot, and the Democrats are doing nothing.\nThriving commerce between the United States and Japan is essential to advancing opportunity and prosperity for our people.  The United States and Japan are the world’s largest and third-largest economies.  Together, our nations comprise nearly one-third of the entire globe’s GDP.  Japan is America’s third-largest agricultural export market, and this makes it even bigger.  And America is Japan’s foreign investor, and that’s what I was talking about — all of the plants that are going up all over the country.\nI said to Prime Minister Abe: “Please, we need auto plants.”  And I said that right at the beginning when I first met with him, and immediately liked him a lot.  And they’ve really produced.  They’re doing a lot of plants, not just auto.  Many, many — many, many plants and factories are being built in the United States by Japan and Japanese companies.\nThese agreements will ensure that our economic partnership flourishes brighter than ever before.  I think we’re probably at a stage with Japan where I don’t think our relationship has ever been stronger or better than it is right now.\nIn the months ahead, our teams will continue negotiations on remaining areas of interest to achieve a final and very comprehensive agreement.  We’re working on that right now.  There’s some big, big things that we’re working on.\nAnd I’d like now to invite Ambassador Robert Lighthizer to provide further details on these historic deals.  And I want to thank you very much.  I want to thank everybody in the room for being here.  And thank you very much to the media for being here too.  Thank you.\nPlease, Robert.  (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER:  Well, thank you very much, Mr. President.  Thank you for helping us get this agreement across the finish line.  But more importantly, thank you for reorienting trade policy in the United States in the direction of America’s workers, farmers, and ranchers.\nFor too long, we had lost our way, quite frankly.  And during the last almost three years, you’ve brought us back.  And I’m very grateful for that, and I’m grateful to have been a part of it.\nI want to thank, if I can, a few people on my team.  We had a huge group involved.  Jeff Gerrish and Greg Doud, my — two of my deputies; Michael Beeman; Sharon Bomer Lauritsen.  And then there are lots of other people who gets a lot of credit for doing this.\nLet me just quickly make the point that the President has already made: This is a very big trade deal.  This is about 55 billion dollars’ worth of trade.  With this, we’ll have more than 95 percent of the GDP that would have been in TPP.  So it’s very important for farmers.  It’s also important for digital trade.\nJapan is the biggest market for United States in beef, pork, wheat.  And it’s a substantial market in a variety of other things, including potatoes, which weren’t mentioned, and a lot of the nuts and other products.  It also affects wine and the like.  So we see — we think we’ll have substantial additional sales as a result of this.\nSo, thank you again, Mr. President.  It’s a pleasure — it’s an honor for me to be the person who gets to sign this.\nI would like now to turn it over to — the podium over to Ambassador Sugiyama, who is not only the Ambassador from Japan to the United States, but also was very active in actually getting this deal across the finish line.  So thank you very much.  (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR SUGIYAMA:  Well, frankly speaking, I must tell you that I feel really daunting, and I feel very much tense.  And I couldn’t feel more honored to be here in this signing ceremony place in the White House, Mr. President.  In front of this top leadership, no ambassador couldn’t feel as I just told you.\nMr. President, Ambassador Lighthizer, and members of Congress, and members of Cabinet, and governors, distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen: Actually, I couldn’t forget the time when Mr. President and my Prime Minister Abe declared, just about one month and — one year and one month ago, something in the sideline of UNGA last year, to declare that we should, sooner than later, kick off a bilateral trade agreement.  That was 13 months ago or something.\nAnd with some reasons, I think it took (inaudible) something like six months to wrap things up by Mr. President and my Prime Minister in New York on the 25th of last month to declare that, politically, it was all done.  It was only remaining, you know, legal (inaudible), technical sort of things.\nAnd then, my people and Bob Lighthizer’s people, and your people and everybody, spent 24 hours, day and night, to finalize everything so that we are able to have, today, for the formal signing ceremony day, to sign up the (inaudible) trade agreement, as well, as Mr. President rightly mentioned, important thing is plus digital trade agreement, as well as other related, attached document (inaudible).\nActually, I had to sign 16 or 18 places prior to this — (laughter) — with my very beautiful fountain pen.  Actually, Mr. President was kind enough to give me a really, really memorable pen to sign with — with his really good signatures.\nSo, to me, as Bob Lighthizer was kind enough to mention that, from the stretch I was in, in the (inaudible), and then Bob Lighthizer and my Minister Motegi — their team and our team seemed to be sometimes very much — you know, tense discussions, something which is quite not abnormal, because after all, this is a trade deal.\nBut, basically, based upon the fundamental friendship and trust relations between the two leaders, Mr. President and my Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  And plus, Ambassador Lighthizer and his opposite number, Minister Motegi, and us.\nSo we have had a really serious and fierce sometimes debates, which is really natural.  But really, a (inaudible) was something to go to try to target the same target to gain, for both of us, a beneficial outcome, which is something that I feel very much honored to sign this afternoon.\nSo — and then, as Mr. President and Lighthizer — Ambassador Lighthizer mentioned, we have — well, Mr. President, unfortunately, we are outnumbered by the people you have here — (laughter) — because you are here in the States.  We are in Washington.  But nonetheless, we have three gentlemen from Japan Commerce Association of Washington, D.C.: Tetsuo Iguchi, Toshiba Corporation.  Here they are.  And then, two Mitsubishi Corporation: Go Eguchi and Akihiko Nakazono.  And these are the guys who are kind enough to join us.\nAs I told you, repeatedly, we are unfortunately slightly outnumbered — (laughter) — but they are kind enough to come over to see this signing ceremony because of the importance for the Japanese business and Japanese market and all Japan.\nThank you, Mr. President.  And thank you everybody.  (Applause.)\nAMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER:  I’m not doing this until you tell me.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.  (Laughter.)\nI do want to pay compliments, though.  Look at these five gentlemen right there.  Right there.  That’s central casting.  They are very tough negotiators.  (Laughter.)  Tough negotiators.  Good.  Congratulations.\n(The agreements are signed.)  (Applause.)\nWell, that’s a big one.  That’s a very big one.  And I’d like to just introduce, if I might, some of the folks here.  As you know, Ambassador Gerrish and Doud have been introduced.  And great job, fellas.  But Bruce Kettler, Director of the Indiana State Department of Agriculture.  Eddie Settle, Commissioner — Chairman of the Wilkes County [Board of Commissioners], North Carolina.  And that’s a lot of territory.  That’s great stuff.  Where are you?  Good.  Congratulations.\nTony Kurtz, State Representative, Vice Chair of the Wisconsin Assembly Committee on Agriculture.  Good job.  Good job, Tony.  Go back and say you did it.  You’re going to be — you can run for anything, right?\nBarbara Glann, National Association of State Department of Agriculture.  Barbara, congratulations.  Ben Scholz, National Association of Wheat Growers.  It’s a big — that’s a big deal, Ben.\nMR. SCHOLZ:  (Inaudible) we’re ready to sell wheat.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They’re ready.  They’re ready to buy it, I’ll tell you.  They’re going to buy a lot of wheat.\nJennifer Houston, National Cattlemen’s Beef Association.\nMS. HOUSTON:  Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.  I thought that was you.  I could tell with the hat.  (Laughter.)\nKevin Ross, National Corn Growers Association.  Congratulations.\nMR. ROSS:  Thank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic job.\nRandy Mooney, National Milk Producers Federation.\nMR. MOONEY:  Back here, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Good, Randy.\nDavid Herring, National Pork Producers Council.  And, David, you are a very big beneficiary to things that are going on, but the pork is off the charts — the numbers.  Aren’t they?  It’s going good.\nMR. HERRING:  This is wonderful news for our pork producers in this country.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nMR. HERRING:  Japan has been our number one value market for many years.  And it’s just great momentum.  It creates tremendous opportunity in rural America.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And China is a big buyer right now, right?\nMR. HERRING:  Pork is starting to move to China.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yep.  I know.  China — they’re going to be a very big buyer.  It’s already happened.\nKody Carson — thank you very much.\nMR. HERRING:  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Kody Carson, National Sorghum Producers.  Where is Kody?  Great.  Good job.  Good job.  Are you happy about this one?\nMR. CARSON:  Extremely (inaudible).\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You said the right thing.  I got to be careful.  (Laughter.)\nMR. CARSON:  With China and Japan in the market —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I know that.  It’s great.\nMR. CARSON:  (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  This is going to be phenomenal.  This — Julie Anna Potts, North American Meat institute.  Thank you.  Thank you, Julie, very much.\nMS. POTTS:  Thank you.\nDarren Armstrong, U.S. Grains Council.  Hi, Darren.\nMR. ARMSTRONG:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It’s a great deal.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Yeah, it’s great.  Thank you very much.\nHobey Bauhan, Virginia Poultry Federation.  Hobey, thank you very much.\nMR. BAUHAN:  Thank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Tom Nassif, Western Growers Association.\nMR. NASSIF:  Right here, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Thank you, Tom.\nMR. NASSIF:  We’re going to bring fresh produce.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You better believe it.  Thank you.  Congratulations.  Say hello to everybody.\nTom Stenzel, United Fresh Produce Association.\nMR. STENZEL:  Yes, sir.  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Tom, thank you very much.  Saw you back there.\nVince Peterson, U.S. Wheat Associates.  Vince?\nMR. PETERSON:  Sir, thank you very much.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very — congratulations.  It’s going to be a lot of wheat.\nMR. PETERSON:  A lot of wheat.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  A lot of wheat going to Japan.\nAnd Fred Wacker, Montana Stockgrowers Association.\nMR. WACKER:  Right here, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic.  Thank you very much.\nMR. WACKER:  Thank you so very much.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic job you’ve all done.  And again, my friend.\nSENATOR DAINES:  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Great job, Steve.\nOkay, so we’ve had a tremendous success.  Likewise, we’re having a lot of successes.  We have tremendous success at the border.\nI want to thank Mexico for what they’ve been doing.  You look at the numbers; they’re tumbling down.  This is one on catch and release.  Look at that.  See that, fellas?  Catch and — would you say that’s pretty good?  I’d say it’s pretty good.  I’d say it’s pretty amazing, Steve, even for your — from your standpoint, Steve, fellas.  That’s some number, huh?  Getting down to almost zero.  Look.\nSo it was not doing so good for a long time.  Catch and release.  We had no help from the Do-Nothing Democrats, so we did it with Mexico.  We did it with Guatemala.  We did it with — I mean, we did it with some countries that really stopped — El Salvador; Honduras; and others — other countries — countries that are signing safe third agreements, which nobody thought would be even possible.  And the border is really doing well.\nAnd again, Mexico, today has 27,000 soldiers.  Twenty-seven thousand.  I want to thank the President of Mexico, because he’s been great.\nBut the border is really looking good.  The wall is moving rapidly.  Large sections are being built every day.  More contracts are being given out.  We’re — we’re doing it in about 17 different sections, because it’s over 450 miles long –the area we have to close up.  And it could even hit 500 at some point.  And we expect to have anywhere between 4- and 500 built, hopefully by the end of next year.  It’s going up very rapidly.\nIt’s a very — it’s a very powerful wall.  It’s got everything you can have.  It was — and the Border Patrol just left, actually.  We were going over some of the numbers.  And we gave them every single element of the wall that they wanted.\nWe had mountain climbers come in to climb — do you believe this?  We had different samples put up and we had mountain climbers, literally, come in.  “Which is the hardest one to climb?”  The panel — the steel panel on top makes it very difficult.  It’s called an anti-climb panel.  I never thought I would be doing this for a living: anti- — (laughter) — we built an anti-climb panel.  Without the panel, they get across it easy.  With the panel, it’s not so — it’s not easy.  So, anti-climb panel at the top.\nAnd the border is coming along well.  The economy is doing great.  We’re doing — as I said before, we’re the hottest economy in the world.  We’re the largest economy in the world.  We’re up $15 trillion, at least, since the election.  Fifteen trillion.\nAnd China is down, probably, 22 or 24 trillion.  So I think China might have caught us if my opponent had gotten in.  By now, they would have caught us.  And now it’s going to be a long time before they catch us, if they ever catch us.  I don’t think anybody is going to catch us.  If we’re smart, nobody will catch us.\nSo with that being said, if you have any questions on the trade deal, please.  Anything on the trade deal, specifically?  Yeah, please.\nQ    Do you have any predictions about China?  Do you expect a whole new offer or any optimism?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, they want to make a deal.  They’re down three and a half million jobs since we started doing what we do.  And their supply chain is really cracked and broken.  And they want to make a deal.\nNow, they’re coming to see us on Thursday and Friday.  We think there is a chance that we could do something very substantial.  Bob, I think you think that.  We’ll see what happens.  But, in the meantime, we’re taking in billions and billions of dollars of tariffs every month and we’ve never had this.  We never took in 10 cents from China and we’re taking in billions of dollars and tens of billions a year.\nAnd on October 15th, as you know, it goes up from — up to 35 — I guess, it goes to 35.  It’s going to — it’s going to raise fairly substantially.  We could always do it a lot more, but we’ve decided not to.\nSo that’s the story.  And I think that they will — they’re coming to make a deal.  We’ll see whether or not a deal can be made, but it’s got to be a fair deal.\nLook, we’ve lost $500 billion a year for many, many years on average.  If you include intellectual property theft and all of the other things that took place, it’s incredible that past administrations could have allowed it to happen.  We’re talking about $500 billion — not million; that’s a lot, too — $500 billion a year, for many years, taken out of our country.\nWe rebuilt China.  They did a great job and I don’t blame them.  I told President Xi, “I don’t blame you one bit.”  I blame the people that ran this country to allow that to happen.  And they understand that.  But we don’t let that happen anymore.\nSo, we’ll see what happens.  We’re going to have a very important meeting.  And they have their top people coming in.  And I have my top people doing the job.  And if I don’t think they’re doing a good job, I’ll fire them and I’ll go over and take their place.  (Laughter.)  Okay?\nYeah, please.\nQ    On Hong Kong, sir, are the Hong Kong protests linked, in your view, to the China trade negotiations in any way?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’d like to see a very humane solution to that.  I hope that’s going to happen.  And, you know, Hong Kong is very important as a world hub — not just for China, but for the world.  And you have great people over there.\nI see they’re flying the American flags.  They even have signs: “Make China Great Again.”  “Make Hong Kong Great Again.”  (Laughter.)\nAnd I’m saying, “Get those signs.”  But they have, you know, tremendous signage and tremendous — they have a tremendous spirit for our country.  They have a lot of American flags, a lot of Trump signs.\nI’d just like to see a humane deal be worked out.  And I think President Xi has the ability to do it.\nI sort of said that I think if he met — he’s a very convincing man, and I think if he met with some of the leaders — that could be one problem, you don’t seem to have a specific leader of the group.  But I really think they can do something.  We just want to see a humane solution.\nQ    Did you tell Xi Jinping in any way that you would be quiet about Hong Kong protests during the course of these negotiations?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I didn’t.  But I do say that we are negotiating.  If anything happened bad, I think that would be a very bad for the negotiation.  I think, politically, it would be very tough maybe for us, and maybe for some others, and maybe for him.\nBut, no, I think that they have to do that in a peaceful manner.  It’s — now, I will say, the first time I saw it, if you look — a number of months ago, I saw 2 million people.  I’ve never seen anything like it.  We talk about crowd size.  That was serious crowd size, right?   The crowd size is much smaller now, so maybe that’s saying something.  But hopefully they can work out something that’s amicable.\nYes, sir.\nQ    Mr. President, would you accept a partial trade deal with China?  There has been some talk today about whether or not it could be headed in that direction.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, it’s a very good question.  I think it’s not what we prefer at all.  They are starting to buy a lot of our agricultural products.  You see that.  They’re coming in very strong on pork, also — very, very strong — and in particular.  But on other products, that — so, I don’t know if you call that a “partial.”  We don’t have an agreement.\nMy inclination is to get a big deal.  We’ve come this far.  We’re doing well.  Again, the fact that they’ve done what they’ve done with their currency — the devaluation — it really has not increased prices.  And now we’re talking China.  It doesn’t mean that in all cases that happens; other countries prices increase, but in the case of China that hasn’t happened.  And they put a lot of money into their goods.  They want to keep their people working.  I understand that very well.\nBut I think that we’ll just have to see what happens.  I would much prefer a big deal.  And I think that’s what we’re shooting for.  Can something happen?  I guess, maybe.  Who knows?  But I think it’s probably unlikely.  Okay?\nQ    Mr. President, on Syria — on withdrawing forces in Syria —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    — why are you siding with an authoritarian leader and not our Kurdish allies?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m not siding with anybody.  We’ve been in Syria for many years.  You know, Syria was supposed to be a short-term hit — just a very short-term hit.  And we were supposed to be in and out.  That was many, many years ago.  And we only have 50 people in that area.  That’s a small sector.\nAnd I don’t want those 50 people hurt or killed or anything.  I don’t want anything bad to happen to our people.  And I told that to President Erdoğan.  I said, “Don’t hurt any of our — any of our people get hurt, big trouble.”\nNow, a couple of things: I think there’s a lot of pressure on Turkey.  They have been fighting with the PKK for many years.  They’re natural enemies.  If you read today, a couple of reports saying that when President Obama started this whole thing — as you know, it was started by President Obama — he created a natural war with Turkey and their long-time enemy, PKK.  And they’re still there.  And they’re still hating each other beyond anybody’s belief.\nBut I have told Turkey that if they do anything outside of what we would think is humane — to use the word a second time; we talk about Hong Kong, we talk about this — they could suffer the wrath of an extremely decimated economy.  And I’ve done it once.  I did it with Pastor Brunson.  You remember the Pastor Brunson?  And they wouldn’t give Pastor Brunson back, and they ended up giving Pastor Brunson back pretty quickly.  Their currency fell at record levels and lots of other things happened.  And it was good.  I have a very good relationship with President Erdoğan.  I want to see it happen.\nI will tell you this though: We defeated ISIS.  And when I wanted to — when we were at 96 and 95 and 97 percent, I sort of said, “Let the other countries in the area finish it off.”  And I was met with a lot of anger from some people in our country.  I said, “All right.  I’ll finish it off.”  And I got together with our generals.  I flew to Iraq.  I got together.  And we did it very quickly.  Far quicker than any general from here told us we could do it.  We have some great people over there.  They did it quickly.\nAnd I said to the European countries, “You’ve got to take your ISIS…”  You know we have 60,000, maybe even 70,000 people — that includes families, that includes wives of fighters that were killed.  We have many fighters that were killed in the battles.  And we took it. Over 100 percent of the caliphate, I took over quickly.  Nobody else was — it was a mess when I came to office.  And I think most of you would agree to that.  It was a real mess.\nI took it over.  But then I said, “What are we going to do with these 60- to 70,000 people that are being held and being guarded and we can’t release them?”  And many fighters also.  And I said, “I want them to go back to Germany, to France, to different European countries from where they came.”  And I said to the European countries — I said to all of them, “Take the people back.”  And they said, “No, no, no.  We don’t want to do it.  We don’t them back.”  I said, “Well, they came from Germany or they came from France.  Take them back.”\nAnd they’re so used to the United States being a sucker, being a fool — we’re talking about billions and billions of dollars.  You’re talking about life.  You’re talking about so many things, so many elements — and elements of complexity.  Because they’re going to walk back into Germany.  They’re going to go back into these countries from where they came.\nSo I said, “Take them back.”  And they said, “No.”  And then I said again, “I’m going to give you another 30 days.  Take them back.”  And they kept saying, “No.”  Maybe they won’t be saying “no” now.  I don’t know.\nSo I told President Erdoğan, “You got to — it’s going to be your responsibility.”  Now, really, who’s responsible — it’s really Russia, it’s Turkey, it’s Iran, it’s Iraq, and it’s Syria, and anybody else in the neighborhood.  Okay?  We call it the “neighborhood.”  It’s not a friendly neighborhood.  But these countries should do it.\nNow, ISIS is the sworn enemy of all of these countries.  Many of them they hate far more than they hate us, and those countries hate them at the same level as we do.  They’re — they’re terrible, terrible, savage killers.  I said, “Take them back.”\nBut these countries are rich, in most cases.  They’re powerful.  They’ve got armies.  They can do the work.  But we’re not bringing 50-, 60-, 70-, or even 10,000 people to Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.  We’re not going to paying them for the next 50 years, or paying to take care of them for the next 50 years.  So we told Europe — we did a great service to the world.  And we did a great service to Europe in particular, where so many of these fighters came from.\nWe said, “Take them back.”  And, you know, unfortunately, like NATO, they take advantage.  NATO, as you know, I got the Secretary General Stolheim [Stoltenberg] said — and, I think, very loudly — the Secretary General of NATO, said that because of what I did, they have paid over $100 billion more money toward NATO defense.  But that’s still not enough, okay?  It’s still not enough.  Not fair.  Because United States pays far too much, relative.  And obviously, NATO affects them more.\nBut, like NATO, like trade with the European Union, which is a very tough group to trade with — very, very tough group.  Almost as tough as Japan — not quite.  (Laughter.)  But they are a very tough group to trade with.  They take advantage.  And I said, “Look, you take them back.  We’re not — we’re not going to do this.  We’re not going to put in Guantanamo Bay and put them all over our prisons.”\nSo, right now, we’re at a position where, if Turkey does anything out of what they should be doing, we will hit them so hard on the economy.  But when you talk about soldiers — we only had 50 soldiers in the area.  I think the area was — it’s a very small area and — very small area.  But we only had 50 soldiers there.  I don’t want them to be in a bad or compromising position.\nAnd I will tell you this: Everybody respects our country again.  If we want to go in, if we have to go back for any reason — because bad things happen.  But we’re 7,000 miles away.  These ISIS people — whatever you want to call them — these people are right there.  They’re right there.  They’re touching many of these countries that I just named.  Iran, as an example, hates ISIS.  And ISIS hates Iran.  Iraq, you know all about that.  Turkey, Syria — let them take care of it.  Let them take care of it.\nWe want to bring our troops back home.  It’s been many, many years.  It’s been decades, in many cases.  We want to bring our troops back home.  And I got elected on that.  If you go back and look at our speeches, I would say, “We want to bring our troops back home from these endless wars.”\nAnd we’re like a police force over there.  We’re policing.  We’re not fighting; we’re policing.  We’re not a police force.  We’re the greatest military force ever assembled because of what I’ve done over the last three years with $2.5 trillion, Mr. Ambassador, we’ve spent on our military — $2.5 trillion.\nBut we’re not going to be there longer.  And we’re going to be watching Turkey and we hope that them and all of the other countries — or some of the other countries, including the European Union — goes in and does whatever they’re supposed to do with these captured ISIS fighters and families.  Okay?\nQ    Mr. President, a number of Republicans, including — including Nikki Haley and Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell were very critical of this decision today.  Mitch McConnell put out a statement saying, wish you would recon- — exercise leadership and reconsider, and suggested not doing so would be reminiscent of what the Obama administration would do.  Would you respond to that, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    And also, did you –\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Sure.\nQ    Did you consult with the Joint Chiefs of Staff when you made this decision?\nTHE PRESIDENT:   Sure.  I consulted with everybody.  I always consult with everybody.  If you remember, about eight months ago, I talked about doing this.  And we kept 2,000 people there, and then slowly brought them out.  But once we captured ISIS, I didn’t see — I don’t want to stay there for the next 40 years.  It’s not going to do anything.  The end game is going to be the same.\nI have great respect for all of the people that you named.  And they have their opinion, and a lot of people do.  And I could also name many more than you just named of people that totally are supportive.  You see the names coming out; people are extremely thrilled because they say it’s time to bring our people back home.  We’re not a police force.  They’re policing the area.  We’re not a police force.\nThe UK was very thrilled at this decision.  As you know, they’re over there — they have soldiers over there also.  And others.  But many people agree with it very strongly.  And I understand both sides of it.  I fully understand both sides of it.  But I campaigned on the fact that I was going to bring our — our soldiers home, and bring them home as rapidly as possible.\nI, we, all together, you — we defeated and took over 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate.  Everybody said that was going to be an impossible thing to do.  I did it, and I did it quickly because we have a great military now.\nWhen I took over our military, we didn’t have ammunition.  I was told by a top general — maybe the top of them all — “Sir, I’m sorry.  Sir, we don’t have ammunition.”  I said, “I’ll never let another President have that happen to him or her.”  We didn’t have ammunition.\nNow, we’ve captured ISIS.  We’ve done what we’ve done.  We had 50 soldiers in the area you’re talking about.  And I said, “We want to bring our soldiers back home.  It’s been a long time.”\nAgain, we were supposed to be in there for a — just a tiny spot.  Like, a 30- to 90-day period.  That was many years ago.  It’s time.\nQ    Mr. President, the Kurds themselves have lost thousands of fighters in battling ISIS.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s true.  And we’ve lost a lot of fighters, too.\nQ    Can you guarantee their safety?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re going to try.  If you look at some of the Kurds, as you know, that was — that’s a natural enemy of — of Turkey.  It’s — you know, specifically, as I said.  I mean, they have natural enemies.  They’ve been fighting each other for — somebody said, today — hundreds of years.  I mean, one historian said they’ve been fighting for hundreds of years.\nWe interject ourself into wars, and we interject ourselves into tribal wars and revolutions and all of these things that are very — they’re not the kind of thing that you settle the way we’d like to see it settled.  It just doesn’t — it just doesn’t work that way.  But hopefully, that’ll all be very strong and strongly done.\nWe’re spending tremendous amounts of money.  I can tell you, the two countries that are most disappointed that we’re leaving are China and Russia because they love that we’re bogged down and just watching and spending tremendous amounts of money instead of continuing to build our forces.\nWe have tremendous new weapons under development now.  We have weapons that nobody can even believe.  We’re going to be making some stops over the next four or five weeks.  Some we show, some we don’t show.\nBut we’ve rebuilt our nuclear.  We’ve renovated and rebuilt nuclear.  We’re building submarines the likes of which has — they’ve never been even thought of before, the genius of them.  Hopefully and hope to God we never have to use them.\nBut we are doing what we have to do.  But we’ve been there for many years.  Long — many, many, many years beyond what we were supposed to be — not fighting, just there.  Just there.  And it’s time to come back home.\nBut I can understand the other side of it.  But if you go by the other side, that means we should never, ever come home.  We should never, ever come home.\nAnd, you know, I have to sign letters often to parents of young soldiers that were killed.  And it’s the hardest thing I have to do in this job.  I hate it.  I hate it.  Afghanistan.  I signed one the other day — Iraq, Syria.  They get blown up by mines.  They get taken out by a sniper.  And I have to write letters to people.  And we make each letter different.  Each person is different.  And we make them personal.  But no matter what you do, it’s devastating.  The parents will never be the same.  The families will never be the same.  People are killed.  Many people are still being killed.  It’s going to go on that way for perhaps a long time.\nAnd we’re willing to do what we have to do, but there has to be an end game.  And if you stay, it’s going to be the same thing.  Eventually, you’re going to have to leave.  It’s going to be the same thing.\nSo, I think what we’re doing is the right thing.  A lot of people agree with me.  A lot of people agree with me.  And again, you go back and see my speeches, a big part of my speech and always — when I won what some people consider to be a surprise election — now I just see a poll that just came out where I’m up massively with independent voters.  I don’t know if it’s this or because of the hoax, you know, that’s going on with Nancy Pelosi and her — her friend, Adam Schiff.  He’s another beauty.  He got caught lying all over the place.  He doesn’t know what to do.  He’s a mess.  Right now, he’s a mess.  And everybody knows it.  Just all you have to do is a little good reporting, you’ll see he’s a total mess because he got caught.\nBut, you know, we have to do the right thing for our country, whether it — whatever it may be.  And I just think that’s the right thing.  I respect both opinions.  The problem with the other opinion is:  When do we leave?  When do we leave?  We’re going to stay there forever?\nYeah, Jeff.\nQ    Mr. President, the White House Counsel’s Office is preparing a letter to —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Yeah.\nQ    — to Speaker Pelosi about the impeachment inquiry.  What do you hope to achieve with that letter?\nTHE PRESIDENT:   Well, first of all, the impeachment inquiry is a scam.  The conversation that I had with the Ukrainian President Zelensky was a very good conv- — it was a very cordial, very good conversation.  The mistake they made — the opponents, the opposition, the Democrats, the radical Left, deep state, whatever you want to call them — they came out with a whistleblower report before they saw the conversation.\nHad they waited one day, Nancy Pelosi wouldn’t have made a fool out of herself, and she would have been able to say what I said.  Because when she saw it, she said, “This is not what the whistleblower said.”  I had a very, very congenial, nice conversation with a man that I like.  And he ran on corruption.  Because, as you know, Ukraine is known as a very corrupt country — one of the most in the world, shockingly, because I know Ukrainian people.  It’s surprising to me.  But it’s known as one of the most corrupt countries.\nAnd under the past leadership, it was having a lot of difficulty.  This gentleman — the current President, the new President — ran on the basis of anti-corruption, as you know.  I think it was his single-biggest thing.  And we had a great conversation, but it wasn’t reported that way.  The only reason I would have released a letter — because I think it’s terrible to have to release a letter that you have with the leader of a country.  I think it’s a terrible precedent.\nBut the whistleblower report or whatever the news was, was so off.  It was so horrible.  I said, “I never said that.”  I said, “Let me see it.”  We have a stenographer report.  We have a very, very word-for-word report of what I said; I released it.  And almost everybody that read it said it’s either perfect or really very good.  But it’s a very normal, nice conversation.\nAnd when you see that the President of Ukraine, President Zelensky, said, “There was no pressure put on me whatsoever.”  His spokesman came out two days ago — said there was absolutely no pressure put on the President.  I didn’t tell him to say that.  There was no pressure put on him.  All you have to do is read the report.\nThe problem is, I released it a day after they had already made their big statements.  And again, it’s a big scam.  And I think Adam Schiff should be investigated for what he did.  He took to the great Chamber — Congress — and he made a speech.  And his speech was a fraud.  Everything he said was a fraud.  He went out as though I wrote it.  He defrauded the American people.  He defrauded Congress.  He defrauded himself and his family.  He made a speech as — it was a horrible speech.  I said, “What is this go- — what’s going on here?”  I think he’s having some kind of a breakdown.  Because he got up and made a speech that bore no relationship to what the conversation was.\nAnd I’ll tell you, a lot of people heard that speech and a lot of people thought that’s what I said because they heard his speech.  Because they’re not going to read a three- or four-page conversation.  They don’t have access to it.  But I thought it was one of the — I thought it was a terrible thing, where he’s going up speaking as the President of the United States, saying things that I never said.  And the meaning was horrible.  And the whole thought was horrible.\nAnd then, the whistleblower, he did — through his committee, through himself — he met with a whistleblower.  They never said that.  They never talked about it.\nAnd Nancy Pelosi knew all of this stuff.  I mean, she’s as guilty as he is because she knew all of that.  She knew everything about it.  And she didn’t do anything about it.\nAnd I’ll tell you what: They should really be looked at very strongly because what they did is unthinkable.  What they did to this country is unthinkable.  And it’s lucky that I’m the President, because I guess — I don’t know why — a lot of people said very few people could handle it.  I sort of thrive on it.  You know why?  Because — because it’s so important that we get to the bottom.\nWe went through the whole Mueller scam — two and a half years.  We went through that.  And I had three, four days where it was, like, over.  And then I’m walking into the United Nations, and they released it as I’m walking in, Mr. Ambassador.  I’m walking in.  I’m going to meet with — I won’t name, but one of the top leaders of the world.  And I see up on the screen and people start screening about this scam called “impeachment.”\nYou can’t impeach a President for doing a great job.  You can’t impeach a President for having the lowest and best unemployment numbers that we’ve had in 51 years.  You can’t impeach a President for tax cuts and regulation cuts and creating — and even the Ambassador would say — the strongest economy in the world.  We have the strongest economy in the world.\nThis is a scam.  And the people are wise to it.  And that’s why my polls went up, I think they said, 17 points in the last two or three days.  I’ve never had that one.  I’ve never had that one.\nSo, I think it’s very sad for our country.  I think it makes it harder to do my job.  But I do my job, and I do it better than anybody has done it for the first two and half years, based on results.  I mean, you look at not only the unemployment numbers — look at the employment numbers, Jeff.  We have — we’re up to almost 160 million people are working.\nAnd now, today, we’ve signed the deal with Japan, which is such an honor.  And you have a great country — a great, great country.  And to have you partake in our agricultural product and digital is a real honor for me.\nSo thank you very much for coming all this distance and — to be here.  And I look forward to seeing you for many years to come.  Please, again, wish Prime Minister Abe a happy birthday.  He’s a very special man.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nEND\n4:54 P.M.

        "text": "Tyson Foods Inc.Goodlettsville, Tennessee\n1:40 P.M. CDT\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, hello, Tennessee! (Applause.)   And I want to — I want to thank my friend, Secretary Sonny Perdue.  He was a governor who transformed the state of Georgia.  And I got to tell you, other than my friend who I work with every single day, there is no greater champion for agriculture in America than the 31st Secretary of Agriculture for the United States of America.  Join me in thanking Secretary Sonny Perdue.  He is an incredible champion.  (Applause.)  Stand up, Sonny.  Take a bow.  (Applause.)\nTo Mr. Secretary, to your governor, to the members of Congress, to distinguished guests, but most of all, it’s a joy to be here at Tyson with Noel White and the men and women of this great company — a legendary American company that sets the pace, that packages the food that feeds America and feeds the world.  Congratulations, Tyson.  Give yourselves a big round of applause.  (Applause.)  Great.  It’s true.\nIt really is great to be back in the Volunteer State.  And it’s also a special honor and a joy for me to be here with an American that I’ve really come to admire — him and his family — as someone who built a successful career in business, who’s a man of integrity, who came to be known for his values and his vision.  He’s a lifelong Tennessean.  But he stepped forward not long ago to help lead this state as your governor, and he’s already making an incredible difference in the lives of people across Tennessee.  Would you join me in thanking Governor Bill Lee for doing a great job for the people of Tennessee?  (Applause.)  This state and this country are proud, Bill.\nAnd thank you all for that.  It really is great to be here with so many friends.  I’m going to mention a few more of them along the way.  But before we get started, allow me to bring greetings from another friend of mine.  I was talking to him on Air Force Two, right when we were coming in for a landing.  He’s a man who loves the state of Tennessee and has been fighting to keep all the promises that he made to the people of Tennessee in 2016.  I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.  (Applause.)\nAnd thank you all.  Thanks for the wonderful, warm welcome.  It’s — it really is great to be here.  Great to be here with so many with great Americans, and standing and having a chance to walk through a great American company.\nIt’s amazing to think, now going on almost 100 years, Tyson Foods has been an inspiring story of the American Dream.  It’s remarkable to reflect on the fact this company, I’m told, started with one man from a small town in the depths of the Great Depression.  He moved his family to Arkansas in a beat-up old truck with only a nickel in his pocket and half a load of hay.  That’s impressive.  (Laughter.)\nBut John Tyson started hauling live chickens to cities like Kansas City, St. Louis, and Chicago.  And in a few years, he opened his own chicken hatchery and feed business, and the rest is history.\nNow, a little more than 90 years later, one out of every five pounds of chicken, beef, and pork sold in America is produced by Tyson.  That is a story of the American Dream.  (Applause.)  Wow.\nAnd as Noel and I were talking — because of the extraordinary success of this great company, Tyson supports more than 10,000 farmers and has created more than 100,000 American jobs.\nAnd, of course, Tyson exports its — all of its goods around the world, feeding the world as well.  And I was pleased to hear today that Tyson is growing.  In fact, as we speak, Tyson is building another poultry facility in Western Tennessee that, I’m told, is going to support 70 farmers and create another 1,500 jobs right here in the Volunteer State.  Thank you, Noel.  (Applause.)  Governor Lee is smiling about that news.  (Laughter.)\nBut I’m here today because we’ve got work to do, men and women.  I’m here today on the President’s behalf because we’ve got an incredible opportunity in front of us.  As I stand before you, we have before the Congress of the United States what, once it is approved, will be the largest trade deal in American history.  So I came to Tennessee today to say it’s time for Congress to pass the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and pass it this year.  (Applause.)\nSo we’re going to talk about trade today, which Tyson knows just a little bit about — exporting, as it does, literally all over the world, supporting jobs across Tennessee and across America.  We’re going to talk about a great opportunity for Tennessee workers and Tennessee businesses.  But before that, let me reflect on the progress we’ve made because of the confidence the people of Tennessee placed in this President and our administration back in 2016.\nYou know, when I think of the last two and a half years, there’s only one way I can describe it.  It’s been two and a half years of action.  (Applause.)  Two and a half years of results.  (Applause.)  It’s been two and a half years of promises made and promises kept.  But we’re just getting started, Tennessee!  (Applause.)\nI mean, when you think of what this President has accomplished with our strong allies in Congress, it’s truly remarkable.  At a time when too many in Congress have spent the last two and a half years on endless investigations, trying to overturn the will of the American people in the last election, I know the American people are encouraged to see that this President, this Vice President, and this administration will never stop fighting for the policies that Tennessee said yes to in 2016.  (Applause.)  A strong national defense, secure borders, our God-given liberties, and jobs, jobs, jobs.  (Applause.)  That’s what we’re fighting for.\nBut I’m here to say that Tennessee and America are now looking to this Democrat majority in the Congress to do their job — to do a job for the American people.  It’s time for Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress to set politics aside and pass the USMCA.  It’s a win for Tennessee and a win for America.  (Applause.)\nYou know, I really believe the American people don’t want more partisanship; we want more jobs.  We don’t want more resistance; we want more results, more trade and more exports.  And that’s what will come when we approve the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\nAnd when we pass the USMCA, I’m proud to report that we’re going to be building on an incredible amount of progress that the American people have accomplished over the last two and a half years.\nIt’s amazing to think, after eight years of the weakest post-recession economy since the Great Depression, the American economy is booming.  The American economy has come roaring back because President Donald Trump has kept the promises he made to Tennessee to revive this economy.  (Applause.)\nThink about it.  I mean, the President said we could revive the economy if we simply put commonsense, free-market principles into practice; if we said “yes” again to the timeless American principles and practices that have always revived our free enterprise system.\nRight after we were elected, we went right to work.  We cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms.  This President has actually signed more bills, rolling back federal red tape already, than any President in American history.  (Applause.)  We unleashed American energy, and I’m proud to report there’s an energy renaissance happening across this country.  And this year, for the first time in 75 years, America will be a net-exporter of oil.  (Applause.)  We’re on the road to energy independence.\nAnd in the midst of all of that, this President also pledged to fight for free, fair, and, what he likes to call, reciprocal trading agreements with our trading partners.  And we’ve been doing just that.\nThe results — I don’t have to tell you, in a prospering company like Tyson — have truly been remarkable.  Since Election Day 2016, businesses large and small across this country, in the city and on the farm, have literally created 6.5 million new jobs.  That includes 130,000 jobs right here in the state of Tennessee.  (Applause.)\nIn fact, we just confirmed on Friday that unemployment has now hit a 51-year low, and it’s the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans.  The American Dream is working again for every American.  (Applause.)\nAnd since President Trump was elected, the average American household has literally seen disposable income go up by more than $5,000 a year.  And maybe most importantly to the President and me is that wages are rising at their fastest pace in a decade, and they’re rising most rapidly for blue-collar, hardworking Americans.  The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more.  (Applause.)\nNow, all that didn’t just happen.  It happened because of the policies that Tennessee supported, because of our allies in Congress who came alongside this President as we were busy cutting taxes, rolling back red tape, unleashing American energy, and fighting for fair trade deals.  They helped us put in place these policies that really revived the American economy.\nBut what really brought the economy back was all of you.  It was that men and women — hardworking Americans in businesses just like Tysons — seized on the opportunities.  You expanded freedom in the free market across this country to create jobs and opportunity.\nI mean, the truth of the matter is — the Governor will back me up on this — the people of Tennessee and America are the greatest workers in the world, and our businesses can compete with any business anywhere.  (Applause.)\nBut it’s all about the people.  And Noel and I were talking about what a great team you have here.  People like, I heard, someone who actually served alongside our armed forces overseas in Iraq.  He’s a man who grew up in Baghdad, and, after helping our troops in Operation Iraqi Freedom, he came to this country.  He was actually an interpreter in Iraq.\nAnd once he arrived here, he got a job with Tyson.  Within a year, I’m told, he was promoted to management, and he’s been promoted several more times in the 10 years that has followed.  And now, he’s an operations manager here at this facility, leading more than 1,600 employees every day.  So would you would join me in a big round of applause for Falah Al-Sadawi.  Where are you, Falah?  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  What a good man.  Thank you, Falah.\nAnd there’s another person I was told about when I got here — a woman who grew up in a small town in Cuba.  She had dreams of someday coming to America, enjoying the fruits of freedom.  Twenty years ago, she fled the Castro regime in Havana and lived her dream coming to the United States.   A few years after that, she was hired by Tyson and given the opportunity she’s had in this company.  And now she’s actually been promoted to production supervisor.  So would you join me in another big round of applause for somebody out there living the dream here at Tyson: Lisette Martin.  Where are you, Lisette?  (Applause.)  Proud of you.\nWe’re so grateful to Falah, we’re so grateful to Lisette, for their example, for their courage, and for their incredible professionalism here at this company.  And — but I mentioned each one of them, frankly, because they’re just emblematic of all of you.\nI mean, the truth of the matter is that all the employees here at Tyson show every day that, as long as the playing field is level, American companies and workers can compete and win anywhere in the world.  So give yourselves a round of applause, Team Tyson.  (Applause.)  You’re the best.\nBut the President and I understand that opening up markets around the world is critical to the success of companies across this country — and most especially, it’s true in agriculture.  That’s why, since the first day of this administration, President Trump has been working to open up markets around the world.\nWe negotiated a new trade agreement with South Korea. And earlier today, we announced that the Secretary of the Treasury and our Trade Representative are going to welcome a Chinese delegation, led by the Vice Premier, to continue negotiations this week.\nBut the President is going to continue to stand strong.  We’ve put China on notice that the era of economic surrender is over.  (Applause.)\nAnd I promise you — I promise you, this President is going to continue to stand firm, not just to open up markets to our goods in china, but to have China once again — “finally,” rather — agree to embrace the international rules that govern commerce and protect American property and assets.\nNow, later this afternoon, there is also some good news.  I think, before I leave Tyson today, the President is going to have signed two new agreements with Japan that will expand not only digital trade, but will expand agricultural exports by billions of dollars a year to Japan.  (Applause.)\nAnd we’re in discussions with the European Union.  Once the UK makes its way through Brexit, we’ll be negotiating a free trade agreement with them.  So we’ve been very busy opening up markets.\nBut the USMCA is what brought me here today.  Because the truth is, in negotiating the USMCA, the President did negotiate the largest trade deal in American history.  And it’s a win for agriculture, it’s a win for Tennessee, and it’s a win for America.  And I came here today to call on the people of Tennessee to join us in this cause and let your voice be heard.\nThe truth is, according to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA is projected to add $68 billion to our economy and create 176,000 new jobs.  And that’s just in the early going.  It’s also estimated the USMCA would increase annual American agricultural exports by $2.2 billion.\nNow, I’ve got to tell you: The numbers are impressive, but I think all of you here at Tyson know that means — that means jobs, that means prosperity in this company, in this state, in this nation.  That’s why I’m traveling all over the country and the President is making the case that for the sake of the American farmer, for the sake of American business, we need Congress to pass the USMCA.  (Applause.)\nNow, the USMCA is also going to expand access to Canada’s market for poultry, which is something Tyson knows more than a little bit about.  Under the agreement, Canada would actually increase access to imports of American chicken by 10,000 metric tons within the first six years, and then increase it by one percent for the next 10 years.\nIn addition, it’ll allow the United States to export up to 1,000 metric tons of turkey products every year for 10 years, and potentially a lot more than that.\nAccording to one estimate, poultry meat exports to Canada would increase by more than $180 million, or nearly 50 percent, within the six years after USMCA becomes law.  And this is an extraordinary statement about what this is going to mean to producers and to companies just like Tyson and to all of the tens of thousands of Americans that are employed in this industry and around it.\nI mean, Tyson has a lot to gain in the USMCA.  And, I mean, Mexico is actually, I’m told, Tyson’s top export market overall.  And so, I wanted to come here and make sure all the good people working at Tyson knew just how important and how good this agreement would be for your industry.  It’s good for Tennessee, too.\nI mean, Tennessee already exports more than $7.8 billion in goods and services to Canada today.  And under the USMCA, the Governor and I are confident that that number is only going to grow, which is going to create even more jobs, more opportunity, and more prosperity right here in Tennessee.\nAnd so, for the thousands of men and women of Tyson, for millions of citizens across Tennessee, and for America, we need to get this done; we need to pass the USMCA.  (Applause.)\nAnd I’ll tell you what: This President is — he’s impatient for it.  (Laughter.)  Because for all of the progress our country has made, that’s just what this businessman-turned-President calls a “good start.”  I mean, the truth is, we need Congress to approve the USMCA and approve it this year because we want to keep the momentum in this economy.\nBut to make that happen — the reason I came to Tennessee today is because you all are going to be the difference.  I mean, Congress knows where the President stands.  Congress knows where I stand.  But I want to encourage each and every one of you, maybe even before the day is out, to let your voice be heard and talk about what this agreement would mean not just to this company and to your family, but to this state and this nation.\nI mean, I want to encourage you to reach out to our elected officials who represent us in Washington, D.C.  Tell them how this agreement is going to level the playing field.  Those numbers that I just gave you are just the beginning.  I mean, tell your elected officials how this agreement is going to lead to more jobs, more job security, more investment, right here in Tennessee.\nYou know, I served in Congress for 12 years.  It seemed longer.  (Laughter.)  But the one thing I know is the most powerful force in Washington, D.C., is not your cable news networks, right?  Not your social media.  Not your special interests groups.  The most powerful voice — force — in Washington, D.C., is the voice of the American people.  So reach out to everyone who represents Tennessee in Washington, and tell them the Volunteer State needs the USMCA, and we need it this year.  (Applause.)  You can be the difference.\nBut let me say, with a grateful heart — I’ll save you a nickel — you sure don’t need to call Senator Lamar Alexander or Senator Marsha Blackburn because they are leading the charge for the USMCA in the United States Senate.  (Applause.)  They are.  Two outstanding leaders; tremendously respected.  And they’re working the hallways, they’re working the floor of the Senate, and they’re working the airwaves of America, telling this story.  You just call them and tell them you appreciate it.\nAnd also, there’s a number of members of Congress that you don’t need to call, several of which are actually with us today.  They’re strong, principled conservatives who have been there every step of the way with this administration.  I’m going to name them one at a time and ask them to stand.\nCongressman Chuck Fleischmann, would you stand up?  This is a great, great voice for jobs and conservative values in Washington.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Congressman.\nCongressman David Kustoff.  Congressman, stand up.  Thank you for your strong stand.  (Applause.)  Thank you, David.\nCongressman John Rose has been there fighting the good fight to expand jobs and opportunities.  (Applause.)\nAnd Congressman Tim Burchett.  Stand up there, Tim, will you?  Thank you so much.  (Applause.)\nThese are four conservative champions in the House of Representatives.  They’ve been fighting for the USMCA.  And everyone in Tennessee can be proud of this group of congressmen.  Give them one more round.  This is a group of stars.  (Applause.)\nBut there are a few members of your delegation that you could call.  (Laughter.)  You know, and I kind of always had the view, when I was in Congress, that, you know, if you’re part of a delegation from a state, you kind of represent everybody in the state, right?  You’re elected to a district, but you’re part of your state’s delegation.\nSo, right after you get done thanking the people that are standing with us, why don’t you call Congressman Jim Cooper and call Congressman Steve Cohen, and tell them Tennessee needs the USMCA, and we need it this year.  (Applause.)\nAnd while you reach out to them directly, make sure — you know, let your voice be heard.  I mean, send a letter to the Nashville Tennessean.  Call a local talk radio show.  Because I just really do believe, when the American people let their voice be heard — I used to call it the “gale force wind of do something.”  When that hits Capitol Hill, Congress gets off the dime.  And that’s what we need to have happen.  For the sake of our economy and for the sake of our future prosperity, we’ve got to get it done.\nMake no mistake about it: Your voice — your voice will make a difference.  So let your voice be heard.\nNow, listen, I want to thank you for coming out today.  I look forward to saying hello to as many of you as time permits.  And I truly am grateful — I’m grateful for the warm hospitality today.  I really am.\nAnd while I’m at it, can I just say, on behalf of myself and my family, to the people of Tennessee: Thank you for the privilege of being your Vice President.  Thank you for the confidence you’ve placed (inaudible).  (Applause.)  It’s the greatest honor of my life.\nAnd it’s hard for me to describe the privilege that I feel in this role, and the confidence the people of Tennessee placed in this President and in his Vice President.  And I never want to miss the opportunity to pay a debt of gratitude to each of you.\nAnd I promise you: Not only am I grateful, but you also have my promise that the President and I are going to keep on fighting.  We’re going to keep on fighting for all the things that Tennessee voted for this President to do.  Things that we’ve gotten done already that have revived this economy.  We’ve stood by American agriculture.  We’ve rebuilt our military.  We’ve appointed more than 150 conservatives to our federal courts at every level.  (Applause.)  America is standing strong and America is standing tall again, and we’re going to keep fighting.  (Applause.)\nAnd I have faith that our best days are ahead — not just for Tennessee, but for all of America.  Even in these divided times, I’m absolutely convinced — I’m absolutely convinced that as we continue to deliver on the timeless ideals of the American people, that the American people are going to keep standing with us.  But we got to stay in it.  We’ve got to stay in the fight.  We’ve got to keep building on the momentum.  That really is what today is all about.\nAnd we’ve got to have faith in each other.  And I think, if I can say, it’s something that Bill Lee and I connected on early on, that we’ve got to have that other kind of faith too.  (Applause.)\nYou know, I — it seems like you turn on the television anymore and there’s so much emphasis on what divides us in this country, but I’ll always believe that there will always be more that unites us in these United States than could ever divide us.  And chief among those things is faith.\nI mean, everywhere I go — I heard it today when I got off the plane at the airport — people reaching out and grabbing a hand, people from every walk of life just telling you: “Tell the President and you, we’re praying for you.”\nI mean, this is a believing nation.  And on that foundation, I think we can be confident that whatever challenges we face today, we’ll find our way through as Americans to an even brighter future for our children and our grandchildren.\nAnd I can’t help but think of how many times in that book I try and open every morning that they talk about the farmer.  And I looked at a verse in James, Chapter Five, that said: Consider the farmer who patiently waits for the land to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting for the rain in the fall and in the spring, and you too must be patient and have courage.\nSo in these challenging times, let’s consider the farmer.  Let’s continue to advance policies that will create prosperity for the farmer.  But let’s also be inspired by the steady example of faith and perseverance that has always been and will always be emblematic of the farm.\nSo I want to thank you for the opportunity to be with you today.  And I’m absolutely convinced that with your continued support, with your help and your voice, we’ll get the USMCA passed into law.  We’ll continue to build on the momentum in this economy, making America more strong and more secure.  And with President Donald Trump in the White House, and with God’s help, we will keep America great.  (Applause.)\nThanks, everybody.  God bless you.  God bless Tennessee.  And God bless America.\nEND\n2:11 P.M.

        "text": "Pontchartrain Convention & Civic CenterKenner, Louisiana\n1:31 P.M. CDT\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, hello, Louisiana!  (Applause.)  Thank you for that warm welcome.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  Four more years!\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  We love you!  (Applause.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you for the choice Louisiana made in 2016.  And I know Louisiana is going to give President Donald Trump four more years in 2020.  (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you for that warm welcome.  It’s great to be here with so many friends.  Thank you for that enthusiastic — enthusiastic response.  But we’re here to do some business, Louisiana.  We’re here to get some work done for the Republican cause, but let me thank a few people first.\nWould you all just join me in thanking a principled conservative who’s emerged as one of the most respected voices in the United States Senate?  My great friend, Senator Bill Cassidy.  (Applause.)  And Bill and I are here.  We’re here as a part of this Louisiana Republican Unity Rally, because Republicans are unified in Louisiana.  We’re going to elect a Republican governor to Baton Rouge.  (Applause.)\nNow, we gather here because the time has come for every Republican in Louisiana to step up.  The time has come for every Republican to step out and vote to send a Republican governor to the statehouse.  After all, I ran into some great Republican women at the airport when I arrived and they were all wearing buttons that said, “Happiness is a Republican governor,” Louisiana.  (Applause.)  (Laughs.)  You guys are great.\nIt really is a joy to be with you today.  Thanks for coming out on — even on an LSU football game day.  (Laughter.)  It really says a lot about your commitment to this state.\nIt’s great to be here with so many friends.  Let me mention a few.  Another great conservative who represents this state with distinction every day, serves in the chamber I served in for 12 years, Congressman Garret Graves.  Thank you so much for your strong stand.  (Applause.)  And another principled conservative who represents all the ideals that make Louisiana great, Congressman Mike Johnson.  Thank you, Mike.  (Applause.)  You have a great delegation in Washington, D.C.  And today, here, it’s rounded out by Congressman Clay Higgins, who does a terrific job.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Clay.  That’s a strong team.\nLet me also thank your Secretary of State, Kyle Ardoin. (Applause.)  Mayor Ben Zahn, from here in Kenner.  And also, I want to thank Chairman Louis Gurvich and the whole state party team.  I think they had two days to put this thing together and got all these great people out.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Great job.  (Applause.)  We’re on our way to victory.\nBut it’s great to be in Louisiana.  To be honest with you, this is such a special state.  But next Friday, they’ll be celebrating in Louisiana even just a little bit more when the Little League World Champion River Ridge team comes to the White House.  (Applause.)  Congratulations, River Ridge.  Wow.  How great is that?\nBut what brings us here today is a great opportunity for Louisiana and a great opportunity for the people of this state to vote today — to vote a week from today to make sure that you have strong Republican leadership, not just in the White House — like you voted in 2016 — but in the statehouse.\nAnd so, it’s my great honor to be here with two great Republican candidates, one of whom I know will be the next governor of Louisiana.  Would you join me in thanking a successful businessman, a job creator, a strong advocate for limited government who stepped up to lead Louisiana: Eddie Rispone.  Thank you so much, Eddie.  Thanks for stepping up.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Eddie.\nAUDIENCE:  Eddie!  Eddie!  Eddie!\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  And another good man — another good man vying for the same office: a strong conservative, lifelong Louisiana, a principled conservative who I’ve come to know personally.  He’s a member of the Army National Guard, and I can tell you, he’s already emerged as one of the great champions for our armed forces on Capitol Hill.  Join me in thanking congressman and doctor, Ralph Abraham.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Ralph.\nI’m here because I’m for them.  (Applause.)  And give them both another big round of applause, will you?  These are two outstanding men.  (Applause.)  Thank you so much, Eddie.  Thank you, Ralph.  Thanks for stepping up for the state you love.  Thanks for stepping up.\nAnd I’m here because they’re both right for Louisiana.  But before the polls close today, vote Republican, Louisiana.  (Applause.)  Louisiana deserves a Republican governor in the statehouse.  (Applause.)\nAnd while we’re at it, let’s make sure we reelect Billy Nungesser as your lieutenant governor.  Thank you, Billy.  (Applause.)\nSo I’m here with some great friends and here with all of you.  But before I get started, let me — let me bring greetings from another friend of mine.  I told him yesterday, after we finished up a great event in the East Room, that I was headed to Louisiana, and I think he looked just a little bit jealous.  (Laughter.)  So let me bring greetings from a man who loves the state of Louisiana and has been fighting to keep the promises that he’s made to the people of this state.  I bring greetings from President Donald Trump.  (Applause.)\nWe love Louisiana.  Louisiana said yes to President Donald Trump in 2016.  (Applause.)  And I’m here because President Trump and I need Louisiana to say to the same kind of strong conservative leadership in next week’s election.  We need Louisiana to send a Republican to the governor’s office in 2019, and we need Louisiana to vote for four more years of President Donald Trump in 2020.  (Applause.)\nBut it all starts here and it all starts now.  You know, after two and a half years of endless investigations, where the Do-Nothing Democrats have tried to overturn the will of the American people, I can tell you firsthand, Louisiana: President Trump has never stopped fighting for the agenda the people of Louisiana voted for, and we never will.  (Applause.)\nIn fact, if you look at the last two and a half years, I think there’s only one way you can describe it, because of the confidence the people of Louisiana placed in us: It’s been two and a half years of action.  (Applause.)  It’s been two and a half years of results.  (Applause.)  It’s been two and a half years of promises made and promises kept.  But we’re just getting started, Louisiana.  (Applause.)\nThat’s why we need strong Republican leadership in the governor’s office and we need four more years of President Donald Trump.  (Applause.)  It all works together.\nBut think about the progress that we’ve all made together: After the weakest economic recovery since the Great Depression — eight years where the most powerful economy in the history of the world didn’t grow by more than 2 percent — President Trump knew we could do better.  He promised to cut taxes, roll back regulations, unleash American energy, fight for free and fair trade.  And that’s exactly what this President has done.\nWe passed the largest tax cuts in American history.  (Applause.)  This President has rolled back more federal red tape than any President in the history of this country.  We launched an American energy renaissance.  And this year, America will be a net exporter of oil for the first time in 75 years.  (Applause.)\nWe opened markets around the world to U.S. goods.  And this President put China on notice: The era of economic surrender is over.  (Applause.)  And soon, with the strong support of Senator Bill Cassidy, and your delegation in Congress, we’re going to pass the largest trade deal in American history.  The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement is ready to go.  (Applause.)\nAnd the result of all that: The American economy is booming.  Just yesterday, we announced that since Election Day, businesses large and small, like those here in Louisiana, have created nearly 6.5 million new jobs, including 16,000 right here in your state.\nThe unemployment rate is at a 51-year low.  And thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump and our allies in the Congress, more Americans are working today than ever before in American history.  (Applause.)\nAnd this President also promised to rebuild our military, after years of budget cutbacks, to restore the arsenal of democracy.  And I can tell you, as a proud father of a United States Marine — (applause) — I couldn’t be more proud to serve alongside a Commander-in-Chief who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and their families.  President Trump has signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan.  (Applause.)\nAs the President has said, thanks to the investments that we’ve been able to make with strong allies in Congress, “Our active-duty personnel are now the best-equipped, best-trained, and most…advanced fighting force in the history of the world.”  (Applause.)\nWe’re finally giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard the resources and the support that they need to accomplish their mission, and we always will.\nAnd with that renewed American strength, I’m proud to report, we’re standing with our allies and standing up to our enemies.  (Applause.)\nWe’ve brought the rogue regime in North Korea to the negotiating table.  Our NATO Allies are contributing more to our common defense than ever before.\nAnd our armed forces have taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists on our terms, on their soil, and this year, captured the last inch of territory controlled by the terrorist, ISIS.  (Applause.)\nAnd under this President, we’ve not only stood with our military, but we’ve stood with all of you who served in our military.  And this President worked with the Congress, and we are finally giving our veterans access to the real-time, world-class healthcare that you earned in the uniform of the United States.  (Applause.)  Veterans Choice is now available for every veteran.  (Applause.)\nIn fact, I know there’s an awful lot of people in Louisiana who served in our military.  So if you have an opportunity, would you just mind — put your hand in the air if you served in our armed forces just so we can say thank-you one more time for your service to this country.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you for your service.\nAnd this President promised to support the men and women of law enforcement at every level, and we’ve done just that.  (Applause.)  You know, you all have seen it on the news; it’s — we live in a time when we’re actually witnessing disgraceful acts of disrespect against law enforcement officers.  But I’ll promise you, this President, this Vice President, this party, and the American people will always stand with the men and women who serve on the Thin Blue Line.  (Applause.)\nYou know, when I arrived in Louisiana earlier today, I was reminded of the risks and the sacrifices that men and women in uniform, and their families, face every day as they protect our families.  I had the great privilege to meet the family of a local hero who fell in the line of duty on September 20th.  He left behind his wonderful wife Tracy, their seven children, including three who serve in the United States Marine Corps.\nThe captain was a leader in law enforcement and in his community.  He was deeply respected by all who served with him throughout his 30 years in law enforcement.\nAnd as I told Tracy and his family today, America will never forget or fail to honor the service and sacrifice of Mandeville Police Department Captain Vincent Liberto, Jr.  (Applause.)\nI’m so honored when I arrived here at this event to hear that his family is with us today.  Would you all just — would you all just show his family just how much we appreciate and love you and are grateful for all your husband and your father has done for this country?  (Applause.)  Thank you all for that.  And, Vin, you honor us by your presence today.\nThis President also promised and recognized that a nation without borders is not a nation.  The President prom- — President Trump promised to secure our border and end the crisis of illegal immigration.  And President Donald Trump is delivering.  We’ve made historic investments in border security, Mexico is doing more than ever before, apprehensions on or border are down by two thirds, and we’ve already started to build that wall on the southern border of the United States.  (Applause.)\nAnd in support of the rule of law, this President also promised, back in 2016, that he would appoint strong and principled conservatives to our federal courts at every level.  And once again, President Donald Trump delivered.  (Applause.)\nAs I stand before you today, this President has appointed more than 150 principled conservatives to our courts at every level, all of whom will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution — (applause) — like the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, and the right to keep and bear arms in the Second Amendment of the Constitution.  (Applause.)\nI’ve met the — I met a lot of these judges; they’re incredible men and women.  And I didn’t even mention Justice Neil Gorsuch or Justice Brett Kavanaugh.  (Applause.)\nSo we’re standing for security and prosperity.  We’re standing for the rule of law and our constitutional liberties.  And President Donald Trump has been delivering because we’ve had partners in the Congress and in statehouses around the country.  And it’s really why I jumped on a plane to come out and be with all of you today, because it matters.  It matters for the issues that we care about and it matters for our values.\nAnd I can’t tell you — I couldn’t be more proud to serve as Vice President to a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life.  (Applause.)  Am I right?\nAt a time when leading Democrats running for president advocate for late-term abortion and even defend infanticide — just yesterday, the Supreme Court agreed to hear Louisiana’s strong pro-life law, and they’ll make the decision this year.  Thank you, Louisiana.  (Applause.)  Thank you for your stand.\nAnd I’ll promise you, under this President and this Vice President, this party we will always stand for the unalienable right to life.  (Applause.)\nSo in just two and a half years, America is winning again.  And under President Donald Trump, we’ve made America great again.  (Applause.)\nBut to keep America great, we’ve got work to do.  And you all are about that right here in Louisiana, today.  Early voting ends today and then you’ll be back at it a week from today.  And I’m grateful for the enthusiasm I see here and that I hear about all across the state.\nI mean, we got work to do, men and women, but for starters, every Republican in Louisiana has to get out today, or a week from today, to send a Republican to the statehouse as your new governor.  (Applause.)  It’s got to happen.\nYou got two great choices.  And with strong Republican leadership at the helm in Louisiana, I know Louisiana is going to do your part.  You can do your part this year to set the stage for a great victory next year when we give President Donald Trump four more years in the White House.  (Applause.)\nI mean, I can tell you all — you all get him, right?  Isn’t he something?  He’s really something.  Some people think he and I are kind of different.  (Laughter.)  But I’ll tell you what: We’ve become very close friends.  And I can tell you firsthand, the man I serve with every day — we have a President who loves this country, who never quits, who never back downs.  He believes in you.  He fights for you.  And President Donald Trump believes in freedom.  (Applause.)  It’s what you got.  Believe in freedom.\nThen you’ve got these Do-Nothing Democrats who’ve spent the last two and a half years on endless investigations, and they’re at it again.  After two years of investigations, it found no collusion, no obstruction.\nLast week — you all saw it in the news — the Do-Nothing Democrats — Do-Nothing Democrats launched a partisan impeachment inquiry in a blatant attempt to overturn the will of the American people in the last election.  But I think you all see through it.  The American people see through it.\nAnd I’ll make you a promise: Whatever the Democrats and their allies in the media want to spend their time doing, President Donald Trump and I are never going to stop fighting for the agenda that Louisiana voted for in 2016.  (Applause.)\nI mean, the choice — the choice here in Louisiana this week and next year couldn’t be clearer, but the stakes couldn’t be higher.\nI mean, just look at all those Democrats running for President.  I mean, I watched that last debate.  I mean, those people were standing far on the Left, I thought that stage was going to tip over.  (Laughter.)  Didn’t you?  I mean, when they aren’t talking about a government takeover of healthcare, they’re talking about open borders.  When they aren’t talking about higher taxes, they’re talking about taking firearms away from law-abiding citizens.\nI mean, the truth is, the Democratic Party today is dominated by left-wing radicals who want policies like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All and sanctuary cities and free healthcare for illegal immigrants.\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  And worst of all, they advocate an economic system that’s impoverished millions of people around the world and robbed the liberties of generations.  And that system is socialism.\nYou know, I never thought I’d live to see the day that one of the two major parties in this country actually openly advocated a system so antithetical to the principles — economic principles and liberties as socialism is.\nBut I think you all in Louisiana know: It was freedom, not socialism, that gave us the most prosperous nation in the history of the world.  (Applause.)\nIt was freedom, not socialism, that ended slavery, won two World Wars, and stands today as a beacon of hope for all the world.  (Applause.)\nThe moment America becomes a socialist country is the moment America ceases to be America.  So it falls on all of us, on this occasion in Louisiana this year, and all of next year, to say as the President said in his State of the Union Address, with one voice: America will never be a socialist country!  (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE:  USA!  USA!  USA!\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  And you got an opportunity, folks, before the polls close today and a week from today.  I mean, if you’ve had enough of the Do-Nothing Democrats, vote Republican.  (Applause.)\nLouisiana, if you want to send a message to Washington, D.C., send a Republican governor to Baton Rouge.  (Applause.)\nMen and women of Louisiana, you have a chance to send a message that Louisiana supports Republican leadership in the statehouse and Louisiana supports President Donald Trump.  (Applause.)  So let’s do it.  Let’s send the message.  That’s what we got to get done, and it’s going to take all of us to do it.\nAnd, Louisiana, I know you got your work cut out for you, but there’s still time left today.  I mean, you got two great candidates for governor, but I need you to do just a couple of things and then I’m — I’m going to have a chance to meet as many of you as time permits.\nAnd while I’m at it, can I just — on behalf on my wife Karen and our family, can I just say to all of you here in Louisiana, thank you for the privilege of being your Vice President.  It is the greatest honor of my life.  (Applause.)  Thank you.\nBut before I leave, I’m going to give you an assignment, okay?  So if you’re taking notes, get ready.\nNumber one, vote, Louisiana.  Vote Republican in the governor’s race.  (Applause.)  I checked before I got off the plane; early voting ends today at 6:00 p.m.  That means you got about three hours and three minutes.  You could leave here, you could go to the Jefferson Registrar’s Office, 408 Minor Street.  Mayor, right here in Kenner, right?  Not hard to find.\nAnd when you vote, remember: Friends don’t let friends vote alone.  Grab a friend and head out to vote today, and vote Republican in the governor’s race.  (Applause.)\nSo, if you’re taking notes, remember: Vote.  All right?  Bring a friend.  Right?\nAnd number three, every day between now and when the polls close a week from today, just go tell the story.  Tell the story of what we’ve accomplished by having strong Republican leadership, from the White House to the Capitol, representing Louisiana.  Tell people what more we can accomplish with strong Republican leadership in the statehouse.  I mean, the simple truth of the matter is: Elections have consequences.\nThe people of Louisiana said “yes” to President Donald Trump in 2016, and you paved the way to make America great again.  But now you have an opportunity to tell your neighbors and friends that Louisiana has an opportunity today and a week from today to vote Republican for governor in Louisiana and pave the way to keep America great!  (Applause.)\nSo go tell your neighbors and friends.  Tell them what they’re not hearing on most of their major cable television stations every day.  I mean, tell them we cut their taxes, right?  Tell them we rebuilt the military.  Tell them we’re standing for all the God-given liberties that the people of Louisiana and America cherish.  Tell them we put — tell them we’re building that wall.  (Applause.)  Tell them we put Washington, D.C. back to work for them, not the other way around.  Tell them that you need the same kind of leadership in Baton Rouge in the governor’s office.  So, vote Republican. (Applause.)\nYou know, because I’ll always believe when I think back on 2016, Senator, I’ll always believe that what made the difference was all of you, in this state and in states all across the union, that people were talking to one another.\nYou know, I hold the view that the most powerful media in this country is now, and always has been, not your television, your radio, not your mail pieces, not your social media, but it’s word of mouth.  It’s when someone who knows you and respects you hears from you about a worthy candidate or a cause that’s important to them.\nSo I want to encourage you to let your voice be heard and just tell them — say, “You know, I went out on Saturday afternoon.  I watched the score on my phone.  I attended this rally, I ran into Mike” — (laughter) — “and he told me it was absolutely vital that we have Republican leadership in the statehouse, and that by electing a Republican governor in 2019, Louisiana can do more than its share to set the stage for a great victory in America in 2020.”  So go tell them!  (Applause.)  Go tell them what we’ve done.  (Applause.)  Tell them that how they vote, Louisiana, this week will make a difference for this state and this nation.\nAnd, finally, before I leave, I’d ask one other thing if you’re of a mind.  If you occasionally bow the head and bend the knee, I think the next week, the next year, would be a good time to do that.  You know, it seems like — it seems like many in the media focus on more on what divides this country than what unites us.  But I’ll always believe that there will always be more that unites the people of these United States than will ever divide us.  And chief among those things is faith.\nAnd so I’d encourage you as I close: While I’m here to tell you you’ve got two great candidates and I need you to get out before the end of the day, or a week from today, and vote Republican for governor, I’d just encourage you to avail yourself of that wellspring of strength that Americans have always turned to in much more challenging times than we could ever imagine.\nBecause I always believe that those ancient words that Americans have clung to throughout our history are just as true today: that if His people, who are called by His name, will humble themselves and pray, He’ll do like he’s always done through the long and storied history of this great nation.  He’ll hear from heaven, He’ll heal this land, this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  (Applause.)  So pray for America.  Louisiana, pray for America, because it’ll make a difference.\nAnd as this campaign goes forward in the next week, I’m leaving here very encouraged and very excited.  And I encourage each one of you to go out and do your thing today.  If you haven’t voted yet, I told you — Mayor, did I give them the right directions?  Headed that way, open until six.  Or make it happen a week from today.\nBut I’m absolutely convinced, if the people of Louisiana will all step up and elect the kind of strong and principled leadership to the governor’s office in Baton Rouge, if we reelect great Republican leadership at every level across this country, that with President Donald Trump in the White House and with God’s help, we’re going to make Louisiana and America more prosperous than you could possibly imagine, we’re going to make Louisiana and America safer than ever before, and we’re going to keep America great.  (Applause.)\nThank you very much.  God bless Louisiana, and God bless America.  And let’s get out there and vote Republican!  (Applause.)\nEND\n2:05 P.M.

        "text": "East Room5:07 P.M. EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Boy, oh boy.  This is a group.  So — (applause).  So, I’ve been doing this for a long time.  That is the loudest I’ve ever heard anything in this room.  (Applause.)  You just broke the record.  Unbelievable.\nWell, I want to thank you all.  And I have a lot of friends, but — (applause) — and this is a place.  1799 it was built.  1799.  Started off with number six — John Adams, President.  And so, it’s a long time.  It’s the White House, and we love it, and it’s an honor to have you.\nBut you really did — you broke the sound barrier.  I’ve never heard that.  I’ve never heard it quite like that, and I appreciate it.  We love you.  We love you.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  We love you!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  And I’m honored to welcome everybody and these incredibly talented and unbelievable, patriotic, young American leaders.  You’re going to be the leaders.\nSomebody — I would be almost willing to bet, maybe even willing to bet — somebody in that audience, right here, right in front of me, is going to be standing here someday.  I think so.  (Applause.)  (Inaudible.)  You’ve got a good shot.  You’re going to have a good shot.  You’ve done incredible work to get to this position, and I have tremendous respect for it.\nWe’re glad to be joined by our terrific Vice President, Mike Pence.  (Applause.)  And many of our Cabinet members are here.  They wanted to be here.  I told a couple of them, “Don’t have to.  Don’t worry about it.  What the heck.  These are my friends.”  They said, “No, we want to be here.”  (Applause.)  So we have a lot of our Cabinet members here.\nAnd to every young person: You represent America’s future.  You are the best and the brightest, the bravest and boldest, and someday you are going to be setting records like nobody before.  I’m telling you, I know it.  I know where’s it’s at.  I know where energy is, and you have the energy like very few people have the energy.  So I just want to tell you: Get out there.  Prove me right, please.  Okay?  (Applause.)  Prove me right.  I have no doubt you will.\nEach of you has come to Washington for the Black Leadership Summit because you have — (applause) — what it takes to achieve real change on your campuses and in your communities, and that’s what you’ve been doing, and that’s actually why you’re here.\nYou speak out for the values and principles that have made America the most exceptional nation anywhere on Earth.  And I will say this today: It’s greater than it ever was before — our military, our economy.  (Applause.)  We have the greatest economy in the world.  We have the greatest economy we’ve ever had.  Tremendous numbers just came out today.  You heard that.\nBut you stand up for the oppressive forces — and you do.  You stand right up to those forces in our country that demand conformity and control.  You refuse to be censored, you refuse to be silenced, and you will never back down.   (Applause.)  And don’t.  Don’t ever back down.\nYou’re the champions for free thought and free speech.  And I especially want to thank a friend of mine who is — I mean, first of all, you think he’s like 50, but he’s about 25 or something like that.  (Laughter.)  He’s a young guy.  I can’t — I can’t even imagine being so successful at such a young age.  What he’s done in so many ways — and, really, more importantly, letting young people know that they have a voice.  Charlie Kirk, from Turning Point U.S.A.  (Applause.)\nCharlie, you’ve done a fantastic job.  Fastest-growing organization of thought — of thought — in the country.  He is something.  Thank you very much, Charlie.  I appreciate your being here.\nAnd we’re also joined by a friend of mine — just got married — (applause) — just got married.  And Candace Owens — I watched her, and I saw her coming.  I said — you know, I’m pretty good at star power.  I look, and I say, “That’s a star.”  (Laughter.)  Every once in a while, I’ll see somebody.  You know, it happens about once every five years.  That’s all it is.  But I’ll be watching.  I saw Candace probably three, four years ago.  How long would it be, Charlie?  Four?  Maybe four.  I saw this woman on television.  I said, “Man, I don’t want to mess with her.  She’s tough.  She’s tough.”\nNow, I’m not allowed to say it — you know that.  I’m not allowed to say it anymore, but she’s also beautiful.  So, I’ll say that, too.  (Applause.)  Okay?\nIt’s true.  Under the #MeToo generation, we’re not allowed to say it.  So, all of you young, brilliant guys: Never ever call a woman beautiful, please.  (Laughter.)  You’re not allowed to do it.  And I’ve kept doing it, and I’ve never been told by that woman never to do it.  Just say, “Thank you, sir.”  (Laughter.)\nCandace, would you come up here, and say a few words?  Do you mind?  Come.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Candace.  Thank you.\nMS. OWENS:  You know what?  I was thinking: Every single President that comes into office, after two years, they look so much older.  He seems to be the only President that’s getting younger.  (Applause.)  Is he — I mean, like, he has somehow found a fountain of youth.  I think he gets up out of bed — it’s the fight.  He loves the fight.  He really does.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We have no choice.\nMS. OWENS:  We are — we are — we are so blessed.  And, listen, let me say this: The media — the audacity of them to think that they’re going to impeach our President.  (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nMS. OWENS:  No.  It’s not happening.  It’s absolutely not happening.  Not under our watch.  We need to make sure we fight for this man — the one man who is standing up for Black America, we are going to fight for, guys.  We have to keep it going.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Candace.  Thank you.  That’s so nice.  Outstanding person.  She’s another one.  You’re going to have to compete with her, too, for this position, I suspect.  (Laughter.)  Thank you very much.\nYou know, it’s sort of interesting.  It’s like: Do we have a choice?  We have to fight, right?  We have to fight.  We have to fight for everything, whether we like it or not.\nAnother man who has been so incredible — Ja’Ron Smith.  Where is Ja’Ron?  Is he around here?  Ja’Ron Smith.  (Applause.)  Man, have you done a job.  You’ve done such a great job, Ja’Ron.  At least come up and shake my hand, will you, please?  (Applause.)  Come here, Ja’Ron.\nYou know, he works with us, and he’s actually not — I always say he’s so elegant and so quiet and so nice.  They say, “You don’t know the real Ja’Ron.”  So I want to see that.  (Laughter.)  But what he does and the job he’s done on outreach and so many other aspects of our lives is incredible.  I want to thank you, Ja’Ron.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  I want to thank you for that.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.\nAnd Ja’Ron knows what I’m about to do because — a man who I met on Twitter, or, as we would say, “social media”; he is some piece of work, this guy — he was hitting Debra Messing like she never got hit before.  (Laughter.)  This crazy Debra Messing started messing with us.  And all of a sudden, I see this man on Twitter, and I see him all over.  And he was hitting her and I never saw anything like it.  (Laughter.)  I felt so sorry for her.\nAnd then, I look and I say, “Who is this guy?”  His name is Terrence Williams.  I look — (applause) — and I look and I said, “Well, you know, the way you look…”  And the first thing I look is, how many followers does he have?  And he had like 700,000 followers.  I said, “Whoa.”\nYou know, oftentimes I’ll be impressed by somebody.  I’ll look and they have three followers, they say.  (Laughter.)  I say, “We have to wait for him or her.”  But this guy has a following like very few people.  And I want to just thank you because I’m a fan of yours, also.  You’re a very successful guy.  Say a few words.  Please.\nMR. WILLIAMS:  Thank you, President Trump.  Thank you.  Yeah, let me — yeah, this is a little too tall for me.  (Applause.)\nFirst of all, I just want to say I love President Donald J. Trump.  (Applause.)  The media is attacking him.  But when they attack him, they are attacking us.  (Applause.)  Because he is out here fighting for us.  And they are harassing you, Mr. President, so they are harassing me.  (Applause.)\nAnd I want to say one more thing here.  A while back, President Trump said, when he was talking to the black community, “If you vote for me, what do you have to lose?” Because the do-nothing Democrats have done nothing for the black community.  2020 is around the corner and we have a lot to lose now because President Donald J. Trump has done so much for the black community.  Thank you, President Trump.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\nHe is something.  And he’s a talented, talented guy.  And when he started talking, I wasn’t — man, I watched it once.  I watched it twice.  And then I called the First Lady over.  I say, “What do you think of this guy?”  (Laughter.)  Thank you very much, Terrence.  We appreciate it a lot.\nWe come together at a time of extraordinary opportunity for our nation.  Thanks to our pro-American agenda, the economy is booming, wages are rising, and poverty is plummeting.  We have the best economy we’ve ever had, and believe me, we’re just getting started.  We have such potential.  Such potential.\nLast month, the unemployment rate dropped to the lowest level in over 51 years — (applause) — 3.5 percent.  People didn’t think they were going to see that a couple of years ago.  If I would’ve said that, the fake news would’ve said, “This guy is exaggerating.”  (Laughter.)\nWages are up by almost 3 percent in the last three years. When I was campaigning three years ago, and people were making less and less and less — they were making less three years ago.  You go back 20 years from then, they used to make more money with one job than they made with two or three jobs.  And now, for the first time in many, many years, wages are rising again.  (Applause.)\nThe unemployment rate for African Americans is at the lowest it’s ever been in the history of our country.  (Applause.)\nAnd African American youth unemployment — young, African American talented people recently reached the lowest rate ever recorded.  (Applause.)  So how do we lose that debate?  We’ll be up and somebody will say, “I’m going to do this.”  I say, “Folks, how old is your country?”  African American — the best numbers you’ve ever, ever had.  And I could go into plenty of other numbers.  For the first time ever, as an example, the most new hires of prime working age are minorities and women. (Applause.)  The African American poverty rate has reached its lowest level in the history of our country, so that’s good.  (Applause.)\nAnd they’re working hard, they’re finding jobs and they’re getting good jobs.  And if you don’t like that job, you can get another one because you have a lot of choice.  It’s like the military; we got them Choice in the VA.  They can go find another doctor.  They can go out — you know, by the way, just because a lot of people are vets — the vets were treated horribly.  You don’t hear that anymore.  You don’t hear it.\nNow, they’ll go out and find some vet somewhere in this country that isn’t happy.  And that person will become a star overnight, right?  (Laughter.)  But you don’t hear it anymore.\nBut we did a thing called Choice.  And that’s where people were waiting — our great veterans were waiting for two days, five days, five weeks, months to get a doctor.  Now they don’t  have to wait at all.  They go outside, they get a good doctor of their choice, and the doctor gives us a bill, we pay the bill.\nAnd you know, the least important thing is it actually costs us less.  That’s the least important.  The most important thing is we take care of our vets.  Our vets were dying waiting to see a doctor.  They’d go in — think of this.  I mean, many of you, you go see a doctor.  It’s not that big a deal.  They would go see a doctor and they’d be waiting on line for weeks.  And they’d be sick, but not bad.\nBy the time they saw the doctor, they’d be terminally ill.  And we don’t do that anymore.\nSo it’s a big thing.  They’ve been trying to get this approved by — for over, I guess, Mike, over 45 years, and we got it done.  We’re good at getting things done.  And how much sense does it make?  So, it’s good.  (Applause.)\nSo you have Choice, also.  You have choice in your jobs.  You don’t like your job, you go out.  We have a great economy.  You go out, get another one.  And it’s incredible how well you’re doing.\nOur agenda is lifting up citizens of every background, race, religion, color, and creed.  But while we are fighting every day to build up our nation, the far-left only wants to wreck, ruin, and destroy our nation.\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And you know better than anybody: For the last three years, Democrat lawmakers, their deep-state cronies, the fake news media, they’ve been colluding in their effort to overturn the presidential election — 63 million people voted — and to nullify the votes of the American people.  And many African American people voted for Trump even then.  Now they like me more, because I said I was going to do it and now I did it.  So you better vote.  (Applause.)  I said I was going to do it.  I said, “I’m going to do it.”\nAUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  But you remember, I’d make speeches and I’d go through a list.  I’d be talking about the African American community and I’d go through a list of worst poverty levels ever, worst crime ever, worst schools ever, worst this.  I’d go through 10 things.  I’d read off from a list.\nAnd at one big rally — I had 25,000 people — I said, “Go with me.  What the hell do you have to lose?”  (Applause.)  Remember that, Candace?  I said, “What do you have to lose?  You’re doing the worst in every category.  You’re getting just — it’s terrible.  What the hell do you have to lose?”\nAnd I’ll never forget, I got off stage and my people came: “Sir, that wasn’t very nice.”  I said, “No, it’s true.”  What do they have to lose?  And you went with me, and I did get a good vote, I have to say.  You went with me, and now you have the best employment numbers you’ve ever had, the best numbers, the best poverty numbers.  So, it’s good.  (Applause.)\nBut the radical Democrats are willing to do anything to smear anyone and to lie about everything in their craven quest for power and money and other things, I guess.  (Laughter.)  I don’t want to tell you what those other things are, but they’re not good.  Although, maybe when the cameras shut off, we’ll talk.  (Laughter.)\nThey’re trying to steal your vote.  They’re trying to steal your voice and steal your country.  They’re trying to steal your country.  And they don’t have what it takes.  “Shifty Schiff.” How about “Shifty Schiff”?\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  He got four Pinnochios today in the Washington Post.  He lies like a son of a gun.  He’s been lying for three years.  (Laughter.)\nBut we will never let that happen, where they take away your country.  We will uphold the sacred principle of government by and for the people.  That’s you.  The corrupt forces in Washington — and they are corrupt — and that includes the media, because large parts of the media — not all of it.  You have some great journalists, reporters.  But large portions of the media are corrupt, perpetrating these hoaxes like never before.\nThe very same people who have made a living selling out American workers to foreign countries.  They were closing the factories.  You’re losing your jobs.  They leave our country, they make the product, they sell the product in.  No tax, no nothing.  So we ended up with empty factories and no jobs, by the thousands, by the tens of thousands, and jobs by the millions.\nThese are the same bought and paid-for politicians who let special interests write the laws, who push trade policies to enrich foreign nations, and who beg far-left judges to rewrite the Constitution of the United States to impose their their own extreme ideology.\nNo one in America has been hurt more as a result of the Democrats’ corrupt leadership and socialist policies than our nation’s African American communities.  It’s true.  That’s true.  It’s true.  For a hundred years — for a hundred years, African Americans have gone with the Democrats.  Has it worked?\nAUDIENCE:  No!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Has it worked?  For — actually, I guess, Candace, it’s even more — but a hundred years.  And you look at what’s going on in the cities run by these crazy left Democrats, and what’s going on is not good.\nMy administration is fighting with everyone, and all our heart — (laughter) — to reverse the pain inflicted by Democrat leaders and to deliver hope and opportunity and prosperity for all Americans, but for African American communities all throughout our land.\nTogether, we will express the corruption, we will defeat the socialists, we will defraud.  And I tell you what: We will do what we have to do, but we will stop defrauding all of the people in our country, because they’ve defrauded the people in our country.  We’ll defend democracy.  And, yes, we will drain the swap.  But that’s what we’re doing.  (Applause.)\nAfrican Americans built this nation — (applause) — you built this nation.  You know, you’re just starting to get real credit for that, okay?  I don’t know if you know that.  You’re just starting to get — you built the nation.  We all built it.  But you were such a massive part of it — bigger than you were given credit for.  Does that make sense?  Right?  (Applause.)  But with Candace around and Terrence, that’s not going to happen for long.  (Laughs.)\nBut through generations of blood, sweat, and tears and — you deserve a government that defends your interests, protects your families, and cares for our own citizens first.  (Applause.)\nYou know, at the border, where they want the open policies — they want open borders.  They don’t want walls.  They actually do want walls, but because I want it — you know, I know how I can get the wall.  If I announce tomorrow, “I don’t want a wall,” the Democrats would come out in favor of the wall.  (Laughter.)  I should’ve thought of that two years ago.  But the wall is being built.  It would’ve been a lot easier.  “We don’t want the wall.”  “We want the wall.”  I say, “All right, go ahead and build.”  (Laughter.)\nOur philosophy is grounded in the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that unite all Americans.  And we really have been united.  It’s been an incredible thing.  A lot of great things have been happening.  You don’t necessarily see it at the top of government, where the hatred is tremendous — the hatred toward us.  And a lot of it is because of the success.  We’re having such success.  We’re showing them what’s going on — when you look at your unemployment numbers, how great they are.  The best in history.  You look at your employment numbers.  You look at the poverty numbers.  You look at all of the things that have been so beneficial, it’s driving them crazy, because they never produced numbers like that.  And they’re losing African American votes, and they can’t do that.  They just can’t do that.  They haven’t done anything for you.  They haven’t done anything. A hundred years — they haven’t done anything.\nAt long last, you have a government that puts Americans first, puts you first, puts your families and your communities first.\nWe’re adopting “Buy American” trade policies to stand up for our workers.  Our tax and regulatory reforms are stopping the outsourcing of jobs, where they outsource all your jobs to other countries, and keeping businesses in America where they belong.  And keep your jobs where your jobs belong.  We’re fighting every day to secure our nation’s borders and to achieve an immigration system that prioritizes American families, wage-earners, taxpayers, and people that can help you and can help our country.\nTo keep our cities safe, we’re supporting the brave men and women of ICE, and Border Patrol, and law enforcement.  (Applause.)  And you’d be amazed at how many African American people come up, and they have people living near them that are brutal killers.  They’re killers.  But you’re tough; you fight back.  But sometimes you don’t win those fights, because these guys are tough, too.  They shouldn’t be in our country.  And it’s really amazing to see what some of our law enforcement does and how much they love you.  And that’s the fact.  That’s the fact.  And we’re lucky to have them.\nTo revitalize distressed neighborhoods, we created something that I’m very proud of.  Tim Scott, South Carolina.  (Applause.)  You know Tim?  (Applause.)  Tim Scott has to get a lot of credit.  He came to me with Jared, and he said, “So, we’d like to do Opportunity Zones.”  I said, “What’s that?”  But once he told me, I said, “Maybe that would work.”\nAnd I think, Jared, it’s one of the great — it’s one of the great unknowns of the successes that we have.  Thousands and thousands of zones in inner cities and poor neighborhoods.  Tremendous investments going in.  Tremendous jobs are happening. Revitalization is happening.  It’s been incredible for the African American community.  I don’t think there’s ever been anything.  It’s early yet.  It’s a year and a half.  But, Ja’Ron, I don’t think we’ve ever had anything quite like it.  And people don’t like writing about it because they don’t want to give the Trump administration credit.  But I’m used to that.  I’m used to it.  You got to get used to it.\nYou know who knows, though?  The people know.  The people know.  But because no —\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  Thank you.  (Laughter.)\nBecause, really, no American community is going to be left behind.  Any community.\nTo help former prisoners get a second chance at life — (applause) — we passed groundbreaking — and this is with liberals and conservatives — some of the most conservative people in the Republican Party were so in favor of it.  Senator Lee — Mike Lee, of Utah, great guy.  Senator Grassley, great guy — Iowa.  So many people.\nCriminal justice reform.  Everybody said it couldn’t be done.  And a group came to my office, “Sir, please.  Please, would you help us?”  These were liberal people.  And I said, “I will.”  Van Jones was one.  Nice guy.  I wouldn’t say treats me too good, but that’s okay.  (Laughter.)  Van Jones.  And he said, “Sir, we need your help.  We can’t get five senators.  We can’t get this, we can’t get that.  We need your help.  We need your help.  Please, sir, help me!  Please, help me!”  (Laughter.)\nI said, “I can get you those five senators.”  And I called five or six or seven, to get the five.  Sometimes you have to call a little more than the five if you want to get the five, right?  You’ll learn.  (Laughter.)  A couple said, “Could I take a pass on this, sir?”  But I got five people.  Right, Jared?  And we got the vote, and people were shocked.  And nobody else could’ve done it.\nAnd they’ve been trying to change this for the African American community, for the Hispanic community, for other communities, but, really, the African American and Hispanic communities, by far, benefitted the most.  And they’ve been trying to do this for decades.  It started with the Clintons.  It was not good.  Right?  Remember when she ran and she —\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, remember when she ran and she had that young African American woman who was tough?  Maybe it was Candace.  Could that have been you, Candace?  (Laughter.) But — no, I don’t think so.\nBut I remember how she was so angry at Hillary Clinton.  But they passed that.  And it was horrible for the black community, for a lot of communities, but in particular black and Hispanic and some others.  And I said to a senator, “It’s a great thing.  We got to do it.”  People are in jail for 40, 50, 60 years for a crime that isn’t even a crime today.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  Right!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right?  Isn’t that right?\nAUDIENCE:  Yes!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Our friend, Jared — we have number of them, but we helped a couple of our friends — a lot of our friends now.  We pardoned certain people.  Who you would say, Ja’Ron?  Who would you say in particular?  Go ahead.  Give me a couple of names, because we had — you know, who I’m talking about?  Alice.  Right?\nPARTICIPANT:  (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We had a woman — Alice Johnson.  We had a woman, Alice Johnson, who was this lovely woman, and she was in for about 22 years already.  I mean, she’s served 22 years, and I think she had another 25 or 26 to go for making a phone call.  And, look, she admits she did wrong.  But, today, it would be a slightly different — like, maybe not enough, to be honest with you.  But it would be very different.\nSo she was in and she was a wonderful woman, and Kanye West came and Kim came, and they said, “President, could you do this?”  I said, “Do what?”  (Laughter.)  “Do what?  What are you talking?”  “A woman has been in jail for 22 years.  She’s got another 28 to serve, I think.  Something like that.”  Think of that.  And she’s got another 28 to serve and she’s a great woman and she’s a wonderful woman.\nAnd I — I get along with Kanye for a long time.  You saw the way he — when he was with the White House; he puts the hat on.  (Laughter.)  I think for one day I went up through the polls like through the roof.  I’ll tell you.  (Laughter.)  He is — with the African American community, they like Kanye and they like Kim Kardashian.\nAnd we pardoned her and we worked it so that she was going to be able to get out — a form of a pardon, where she could get out.  And she came out.  And I’ll never forget the scene: She comes out of this big prison — mean, mean prison.  Not too many of them are nice, right?  (Laughter.)  But she comes out through the doors, and there are her children, but her children are now very grown.  Big strong guys, beautiful women, beautiful — just a big family.  And they just embraced.  They just embraced.  And it was on television all over.  And the love, it was just incredible to see.  And the tears — and they were just like one.  It was incredible to watch.\nAnd I said, “We have to do it with others.”  And you called Alice, I know that, Ja’Ron and Jared.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Come on.  Give — give those names.  They’re great —\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  So you got (inaudible).\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  You have Brenda (inaudible).\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right, Brenda.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  You have, Matthew as well.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  You got Keith (inaudible).\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Right.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  But also, prosecutors are now sending them letter to try to overturn what you’ve done.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.  The prosecutors are doing things that they weren’t doing before, right?  That’s right.  Thank you very much.  That’s great.  Boy, that was a — you have a good memory.  That’s very good.  (Laughter.)  Huh, because you work with it, right?  It’s from the heart.  When it’s from the heart you always remember.  That’s great.\nAnd we have many others.  And we’re going — like we’ll going to Alice, and we’ll say, “Alice, who knows better…” because you can’t let everybody out because, frankly, some are going to be there and they deserve to be there.\nBut we say, “Alice, who else do you think in that prison — you grew up, you were there for so long — 22 years — who else do you know that should be let out?”  And she gave us some names.  And not even that many names, but she gave us four, five names.  And I guarantee you those are great people.  They’ve been in there also for many, many years.  And they got to be friendly.  And afterwards — she’s smart.  After all those years, she knows the good.  And I have no doubt that it will work out.  And we’re getting them out now.  We’re in the process of getting them out to be with their families.  (Applause.) So it’s great.  It’s great.  It’s been a great thing.\nBut I did want to say — so Van Jones was on about two weeks ago and he came to me and — I’m telling you, he was so nice.  He was sitting right there when I was doing it.  And I said, “Thank you, Van Jones.  Thank you.”  This one, this one, that one, that one.  And that was it.  And he came up to me, thanked me.  And that was it.\nThen, about three weeks ago, I saw him on television.  I don’t watch his show too much, neither do too many.  (Laughter.)  But I’m watching him and he gets up and he goes, “I want to thank a number of people, because we did something this year that was undoable.  They said it couldn’t be done.  We passed criminal justice reform.”  Okay?  (Applause.)  Van Jones said it.  “And I want to thank Reverend Al Sharpton.”  Well, he wasn’t nowhere.  He was nowhere to be found.\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Just so we know, I’ve known him for a long time.  He used to love me.  We used to go to fights together with Don King.  Don King is a friend of mine.  Don King endorsed me.  And Don Kin and Al Sharpton get along.  We used to go to fights together, and he liked me until I ran and succeeded in politics.  Then it wasn’t to his benefit.\nBut, look, Al is a con man.  We all know that.  (Applause.)  Just a con man.  He’s a con man.  And he scared NBC into giving him a show.  You know, they don’t want to have any trouble.  But he’s a — just a, sort of a third-rate con guy.  (Laughter.)\nBut here’s Van Jones.  (Laughter.)  Here’s Van Jones.  Van Jones: “I want to thank Al Sharpton.  I want to thank all of these people.”  He’s naming people I never heard of.  The only one he didn’t mention was me.\nAnd then it got worse.  You ready?  Candace, listen to this.  (Laughter.)  Terrence, are you listening? (Laughter.)\nSo he named these people — a lot of people — standing at the end of a show.  “I want to thank — because this was the greatest year we’ve ever had.  We got criminal justice reform.  I want to thank this one and that one and that one and that one.”  I never heard of any of them.  And I kept waiting for my name.  (Laughter.)\nI said, “Darling, come over here.  I’m going to have a great, really, little name mention.”  (Laughter.)  “Yes, darling.”  The First Lady — how good is the First Lady?  So she came over.  (Applause.)  And I kept waiting, and I kept waiting, and then he named a lot of people.  That was the end.  I said — I was a little embarrassed in front of my wife.  I said, “He didn’t name me.  I’m the one that did it.”  (Laughter.)\nI called up Jared.  Right, Jared?  I said, “What the hell is this?”  But before that — (laughter) — he did have one other thing to say.  This was three weeks ago.  He said, “And I have one thing to say that we have to do.  We must defeat this President.”\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  “We have to defeat President Trump.  And we have to work 24 hours a day to defeat President Donald Trump.”\nAnd I called Jared, and I said, “That’s terrible.”  Right?  Is that a true story?  And then he spoke to Jared and he apologized, didn’t he?  He apologized.  But I don’t accept those apologies, you know?  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  All right.  Should we get back onto script, okay?\nAUDIENCE:  No!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  “No.”  They say, “No.”  This is more inter- — they don’t want to go back onto — this is much more interesting.  We love you folks, okay?  We love you.  (Applause.)\nVan Jones.  Van Jones, he’s another beauty.  Thank you very much, Van, for the wonderful acknowledgment.  I appreciate it.  (Laughter.)\nTo give every American child the best chance to reach the American Dream, we are fighting for school choice.  Very important.  (Applause.)\nSadly, Democrat lawmakers care more about catering to lobbyists and powerful teachers’ unions than they do about improving our schools for our children.  And Democrats care more about illegal immigrants than about their own African American constituents.  It’s true.  (Applause.)  They want to give healthcare to people that just walked into the country.  And for you, they don’t care.  The whole thing is crazy.  These people have gone absolutely nuts.\nWhile we’re fighting for the American way of life, the hard left and the radical left is working to trample the rule of law, erode individual liberty, and exert a far-reaching control over our lives.  Left-wing censors have launched an all-out campaign against free speech.  That is why they are trying to silence, de-platform, cancel, punish all of the proud conservative voters, all of the proud African American voices that know what’s happening and know how to become big, big, successful people, help other people.  They want to silence you.\nBut we know the patriots in this room will never be intimidated.  I know that.  (Applause.)  I know that.\nSo here, with us today, is Kearyn Bolin, President of the Texas State University — that’s a big deal — Turning Point USA Chapter, who has bravely defended the right to free speech.  And, Kearyn, would you please come up and say a few words?  Please.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  I thought so.  I love her hair.  (Laughter.)  You look great.  That’s beautiful.\nMS. BOLIN:  So, last year at my college campus, they did try to ban Turning Point from our campus.  So we fought strong and we prevailed.  The piece of legislation was completely unconstitutional, and we are still fighting strong on our campus.  So we’re still there.\nI just want to thank Donald Trump for everything you have done for us.  We are so incredibly honored to be here.  And you’ve done so much for this country, and thank you so much.\nI’d also like to thank Turning Point for giving me the platform and the confidence to fight for a right for freedom of speech.  (Applause.)\nIt hasn’t been easy and it will not be easy, but being a part of Turning Point and being able to see all of you accomplish so many of your goals and to help fight for the freedom of speech, it’s honestly amazing and it gives me so much hope.\nOur generation is playing a vital role in keeping our First Amendment rights, and we are going to continue to keep up that fight.\nSo all of you on your campuses or in high school — I know a lot of you are in high school — continue to fight for your right for freedom of speech because you know where you stand, and everyone else can know where you stand too.  So just keep up that fight.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you, Kearyn.\n(Gives kiss on the cheek.)\nAUDIENCE:  Aww!  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Kearyn.  (Laughter.)  I got to get the other cheek.\n(Gives kiss on the cheek.)  Now I feel better.  (Applause.)\nYou’ve done a fantastic job.  I appreciate it.\nIn order to protect the rights of our students, I signed an executive order making clear that public colleges and universities shutting down free speech will risk losing all of the billions and billions of dollars that we give them.  (Applause.)\nSo we’ll shut down their federal taxpayer dollars that go to them.  And then they shut down speech.  And they just choose whoever it is.  They’ll let somebody speak, they’ll tell other people you can’t speak, and then we’re supposed to give them, individually, hundreds of millions of dollars.  It doesn’t work that way anymore.\nI’ve also tasked my administration to explore every possible solution to stop social media giants from restricting your rights to speak your mind.  And, Candace, you had a problem with that, I know.  And other people have had a problem.  Some people in this room have had a problem.  Terrence, have you had a problem with it?  Huh?  Terrence has had a problem.  It’s incredible.  It’s incredible.  Yeah, no, a lot of people have.  But not the other side of the world.  The other side doesn’t have that problem.  Very rarely do they have it.\nWe must preserve the fundamental American rights that generations of Americans have sacrificed everything to secure.\nWith us this afternoon is Ben Okereke.  That’s a great name.  I love that name.  When Ben was 14 years old, he legally immigrated to the United States after suffering many hardships in Cameroon, which I hear is a beautiful, beautiful place.  Cameroon.\n(Audience member cheers.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Oh.  Wow.  (Applause.)  One person from Cameroon.  (Laughter.)\nTo give back to our country, he joined the United States Army and honorably served for four years — (applause) — as a very talented field artillery specialist.  A lot of talent, they say.\nBen, we salute your noble service.  And please say a few words.  Ben.  (Applause.)  Please.  All yours.\nMR. OKEREKE:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  And thank you, Charlie Kirk.\nFirst of all, Mr. President, we would like to thank you for everything that you’ve done for the African American community so far.  We thank you for criminal justice reform.  We thank you for the lowest black unemployment rate in this country, sir.  (Applause.)\nAnd finally, most importantly, sir, thank you for saving America and thank you.\nAUDIENCE:  Aww!\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  It’s all right!\n(Applause.)\nMR. OKEREKE:  Thank you.  Thank you.\nFinally, sir, thank you for taking down the fake news media, sir.  (Applause.)\nFinally, we want you to build a wall, sir.  (Laughter.)  Frankly, because we don’t oppose immigration, but we oppose — but we oppose illegal immigration.  So we want you to come to this country legally, if you’re going to come to this country.  (Applause.)  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Ben.\nMR. OKEREKE:  Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Ben.  And that’s from the heart.  That’s from the heart.  That’s what it’s all about.\nThe young leaders in this room remind us that true power in our nation is not found in government or hallways or anywhere; it’s found not in the media boardrooms.  It really is where the strength is.  It’s in our people.  It’s in your hearts.  It’s in your courage, your spirit, your faith, and your pride.\nTogether, we will defend the benefits and the beliefs that you want, and you have, and you’re entitled to; the traditions and God-given freedoms that make our country the greatest in the world — and even, I think we can say, right now, the greatest in the history of the world.  Just like your unemployment numbers — greatest in history.  That’s the greatest in history, also.\nYou are my friends.  I’m never going to forget you.  You’ve been incredible.  You’ve been incredible.  Whether it’s Ja’Ron — the job you do; or Charlie, I appreciate it; or Terrence; or Candace, you’re all special people.  Very, very special people.\nAnd you’re doing something very important.  I don’t even know if you know — maybe you don’t know.  And, you know, sometimes you’re so into something, and you just don’t really feel how important it all is.  What you are doing is so important for your community and for this country.\nWe will renew the values that unite our people as one America.  As one team, we will build up our nation, we will lift up our forgotten communities, and we will defeat any threat.  We will beat any challenge, we will overcome every obstacle, and we will achieve a glorious future of American greatness beyond our wildest dreams.  And that’s what you’re doing.\nTo everyone here today: Keep up the great work.  And I just want to say, from the bottom of my heart: God bless you.  God bless your families.  And God bless America.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nEND\n5:50 P.M.

        "text": "South Lawn10:43 A.M. EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So, the unemployment numbers just came out, and they’re the best numbers we’ve had in over 50 years.  The unemployment number is down to 3.5 percent.  So that goes way, way back.  We haven’t had numbers like this in a long time.  Wages are up by almost 3 percent.  That’s a fantastic increase for everybody out there working.  We’re very happy about those numbers.  The stock market is substantially up, as it was yesterday.  And our country does well.  Europe is not doing well.  Asia is doing poorly, to put it mildly.  And we continue to do very well; we’re the miracle.\nBut the unemployment numbers just came out: 3.5 percent unemployment.  And that is a tremendous number; the lowest in over 50 years.  So, very happy.\nAnd, I think, really, very important — again, I’ll say: Wages are up.  When I was running, wages were nowhere.  They were going down.  And people were having two and three jobs, and they were making less money than they made 20 years before.  Now wages are up.  So we’re very happy about that.\nOne other thing, having to do with Poland.  So, Poland is a country; great people.  We have a lot of Polish Americans living in the United States.  I’ve just signed — I will soon be signing — and sign certain preliminary applications.  We will be giving a full visa waiver to Poland.  That means that people from Poland can easily travel there, and people from here can easily go back and forth.  They can each — people from the U.S., people from Poland, can very easily go back and forth between the United States and Poland.\nSo, they’ve been trying to get this for many, many decades.  And I got it for the Polish people, in honor of the Polish people in the United States and in Poland.  So, we’re very happy with that.\nYeah.\nQ    Did you see Adam Schiff got four Pinocchios by the Post, this morning, for lying?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I heard Adam Schiff got four Pinocchios.  That’s good.  He should have gotten them two and a half years ago.\nThat’s a very nice question.  Let me shake your hand.  Come here.  That’s a very nice question.  That’s almost a surprise.  I figured that was a trick question, right?\nQ    Also, what does your letter to Pelosi say?  And when will you send it?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’ll be issuing a letter.  As everybody knows, we’ve been treated very unfairly, very different from anybody else.  If you go over not only history — I mean, if you go over any aspect of life, you’ll see how unfairly we’ve been treated.  We’ve done a fantastic job.\nEverything, to me, is about corruption.  We want to find out what happened with 2016.  And, as you know, there’s a lot of work going on, on that.  I don’t care about Biden’s campaign, but I do care about corruption.  His campaign — that’s up to him.  Politics — that’s up to them.  I don’t care about politics.  Politics, as I think I’ve made clear — and yesterday, somebody asked me a question, and I gave an answer — but always in the form of corruption.\nWhat I want to do — and I think I have an obligation to do it, probably a duty to do it: corruption — we are looking for corruption.  When you look at what Biden and his son did, and when you look at other people — what they’ve done.  And I believe there was tremendous corruption with Biden, but I think there was beyond — I mean, beyond corruption — having to do with the 2016 campaign, and what these lowlifes did to so many people, to hurt so many people in the Trump campaign — which was successful, despite all of the fighting us.  I mean, despite all of the unfairness.\nSo, we are looking at corruption.  We’re not looking at politics.  We’re looking at corruption.\nQ    Sir, what did you say to the Chinese about the Bidens, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know.  Somebody said that a long time ago.  Was that in 2017?  I don’t know.  You’d have to tell me when.  All I can tell you is this: When I speak to foreign leaders, I speak in an appropriate way.  If you notice, they don’t mention the call that I had with the President of Ukraine.  They don’t mention that because it was so good.\nThe only time they mentioned it was when Adam Schiff made it up.  You talk about Pinocchios — that should get 10 Pinocchios.  He made up — he made up a story.  It was a phony story.  Adam Schiff.  So, they don’t talk about that anymore.\nYou know, when this came out, it was “quid pro quo.”  Well, there was none.  Also, yesterday, the Ambassador — who I heard was tremendous and a tremendous person — he was 100 percent for what we’re saying.  A hundred percent.  And, if you look, he also said there was no quid pro quo.  That’s the whole ballgame.\nBut now the Democrats don’t bring that up anymore because they lost.  Look, they never thought I was going to release the phone call between the Ukrainian President and myself.  When I released that call, they were — they were jumping around like you wouldn’t believe.  They didn’t know how to respond.  And then they found out — and then they found out that the call itself was so bad for them.  It was a perfect call.  There was nothing — we hand that call out.  We’ve handed the call out to people, and they’d say, “Wow, this is incredible.”  We’re very proud of that call.  When I speak to a foreign leader, I speak in an appropriate manner.\nNow, we’re also doing trade deals with China and we’re doing deals with a lot of people for the country, so I’m not looking to insult people.  I can tell you that.  But we can probably find that out.\nQ    Would you be more willing to do a trade deal with the Chinese if they investigate Biden?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, it has nothing to do with it.  No.  No. I want to do a trade deal with China, but only if it’s good for our country.  And it could happen.  Because you know they’re very much — they’re very much coming over next week, as I understand it.  So I’d like to do a great deal with China, but only if it’s a great trade deal for this country.  One thing has nothing to do with the other.\nQ    Do you want the House to proceed with an impeachment inquiry at this point?  An official impeachment inquiry.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I wouldn’t mind because we have no rights.  They way they’re doing it, they’ve taken away our rights.  So, if they proceed — and, you know, they’ll just get their people.  They’re all in line.  Because even though many of them don’t want to vote, they have no choice.  They have to follow their leadership.  And then we’ll get it to the Senate, and we’re going to win.\nThe Republicans have been very unified.  This is the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country.  So we beat the one that started immediately.  We went through two years of Mueller, and that came out like a 10.  It came out perfect.  And a few days go by and they start this nonsense.  And this is just as ridiculous.\nSo the Democrats, unfortunately, they have the votes.  They can vote very easily, even though most of them, many of them, don’t believe they should do it.  And I do believe — I do believe that because of what they’re doing with Pelosi and their real leaders, AOC plus 3 — that’s their real leaders — I really believe that they’re going to pay a tremendous price at the polls.\nAnd we saw the first glimpse of it two weeks ago, in a great state, North Carolina.  We saw a great, great glimpse of what’s going to happen.  Because, in North Carolina, we had two races.  One gentleman, Dan Bishop, was down by 17 points with three weeks to go, and he won easily.  And the other man, as you know, Greg Murphy, was up by a very little bit and he won by a massive amount — I don’t know, someplace in the twenties.  Twenty percent or something.  Maybe higher.\nSo I think you got your first glimpse of what’s going to happen.  And the big key is that I have to campaign there.  But if you look at what happened in North Carolina — two races — we won both of them, and we won them easily.  And one was almost tied and the other one was a big, big lead, and that one turned and the tie became a landslide.\nQ    Mr. President, did Mitch McConnell make you any promises about a vote on impeachment in the Senate?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don’t know about Mitch.  I have a lot of respect for Mitch McConnell.  I know that; I saw his statements.  And he thinks that this is ridiculous.  He thinks it’s unfair.  I saw his statement yesterday that he put out where he read my phone conversation and he thought it was a wonderful conversation.  And it was.\nBut, see, the Democrats don’t talk about that anymore.  They try and go to other things.  These people are looking for anything they can get because they know they’re going to lose the election.  And we’re in election season now.  For them to be doing this now, it’s never been done.\nQ    The U.S. is speaking to North Korea in Sweden.  What do you expect?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  What?\nQ    The U.S. is speaking to North Korea in Sweden right now.  What do you expect?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So we’re dealing with North Korea.  They want to meet, and we’ll be meeting with them.  It’s probably being set up as we speak, but we’ll let you know.  But North Korea would like to do something.  Iran would like to do something.  We have a lot of countries in a very good position right now, despite the witch hunt, which hurts our country and it hurts America.  But Iran wants to do something.  North Korea wants to do something.  And China would like to do something.\nQ    Is the Justice Department investigating Joe Biden?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know that.  That, you’d have to ask.  Is the Justice Department investigating Joe Biden?\nQ    Yes, sir.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, that, you’d have you to ask Attorney General Barr.  But I can tell you, just as an observer, what I saw Biden do with his son — he is pillaging these countries, and he’s hurting us.  How would you like to have, as an example, Joe Biden negotiating the China deal if he took it over from me after the election?  He would give them —\nQ    Mr. President —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  He would give them everything.  He would give them everything.  How would you like to have that?  Joe Biden would just roll out the red carpet.  He would give them everything.\nSo, again, this doesn’t pertain to anything but corruption.  And that has to do with me.  I don’t care about politics.  I don’t care about anything.  But I do care about corruption.  And to have somebody take out a billion and a half dollars out of China, who’s totally unfit.  He’s unfit.  To have him get a billion and a half dollars, to have him — and now I’m hearing the number of $50,000 a month.  Now I’m hearing the number of $50,000 a month is very low.  It’s a much higher number that Biden’s son was getting per month.  The fact is it’s much higher.  And for him to — and for him, as a total — for him, as a totally unqualified person, to be getting hundreds of thousands a month is very, very (inaudible).\nSo, again, is the Justice Department investigating that?  I just don’t know.\nQ    Mr. President, do you think the Democrats have the votes?  Do you think the Democrats have the votes to impeach you?  Do you think you will be impeached?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think they follow the leader.  One thing with the Democrats — I give them credit for it — a lot of them don’t want it; you know that, you interview them.  A lot of them are in there — they call them “Trump districts” — where I won and then they won after when I wasn’t running.  But I’m going to win them big.\nIf you look at what’s happened with my polls, they’re through the roof.  You know why?  Because of this phony witch hunt.  If you look at what happened with the fundraising, we’ve set a record — the Republicans — because people are sick and tired of it.\nI got a call the other night from pastors — the biggest pastors, evangelical Christians.  They said, “We have never seen our religious or any religious so electrified.”  They are — they say they’ve never seen anything like it.  Churches are joining.  Hundreds of thousands of people.  And, you know, that’s to a large extent because of you and your partner, the Democrats.\nQ    But do you think it will pass the House, sir?  Do you think it will pass the House and die in the Senate?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think this.  I think this: We have great — we have a great relationship in the Senate.  I have a 95 percent approval rating in the Republican Party.  I believe the Senate — and I haven’t spoken to that many senators — but I believe the senators look at this as a hoax.  It’s a witch hunt.  It’s a disgrace.  Should have never happened.  Just like Russia collusion delusion should have never happened.  That was a witch hunt.  And just like that, should have never happened.\nSo I think in the Senate, I think they feel that the Republican Party has been treated very, very badly.  Now, in the House, they have the majority.  They all vote with AOC and plus three.  Nancy Pelosi is petrified of them.  I mean, she’s afraid she’s going to lose her position.  Nancy Pelosi will lose her speakership right after the election when the Republicans take over the House.\nQ    Sir, can we talk about the text messages that included holding off a visit to the White House?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  The one text message that I saw was just about the last text message.  Because I don’t know — I don’t even know most of these ambassadors.  I didn’t even know their names.  But the text message —\nQ    But what it included, sir, was a visit to the White House.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — the text message that I saw from Ambassador Sondland — who’s highly respected — was: There’s “no quid pro quo.”  He said that.  He said, by the way — it almost sounded like in general — he said, by the way, there’s “no quid pro quo.”  And there isn’t.\nNow, for Biden there would be.  But listen to this: There is no pro quo.  And that was the text message that I saw.  And that nullified everything.\nQ    Have you asked foreign leaders for any corruption investigations that don’t involve your political opponents?  That is, are there other cases where you’ve asked for corruption investigations?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You know, we would have to look.  But I tell you, what I asked for and what I always will ask for is anything having to do with corruption with respect to our country.  If a foreign country can help us with respect to corruption and corruption probes, and that — I don’t care if it’s Biden or anybody else.  But if they can help us — if Biden is corrupt, if his son is corrupt.  When his son takes out billions of dollars — billions — and he has no experience; he just got fired from the Navy — when they do that, that’s no good.\nSo the only — just to finish your question — anything having to do with corruption, I actually feel I have an obligation to do that.\nQ    Including with Mr. Putin, sir?\nQ    Is someone advising you that it is okay to solicit the help of other governments to investigate a potential political opponent?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, I don’t say anything is okay.  I’ll tell you what’s okay.\nQ    Is someone advising you that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Here’s what’s okay: If we feel there’s corruption, like I feel there was in the 2016 campaign — there was tremendous corruption against me — if we feel there’s corruption, we have a right to go to a foreign country.\nAnd just so you know — just so you know, I was investigated.  I was investigated.  Okay?  Me.  Me.  In my campaign — I ran, I won.  I was invest- — you won’t say that, will you?  I was investigated.  I was investigated.  And they think it could have been by UK.  They think it could have been by Australia.  They think it could have been by Italy.  So when you get down to it, I was investigated by the Obama administration.  By the Obama administration I was investigated.  So when these people talk —\nBut as far as I’m concerned, what I want to look at and what we want to investigate: anything having to do with corruption.\nQ    In your view, Mr. President, do you view China as an ally, a partner, or an adversary?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I view China as somebody we’re trying to make a deal with; we have a very good chance of making a deal with.  We’ve had good moments with China.  We’ve had bad moments with China.  Right now, we’re in a very important stage in terms of possibly making a deal.  If we make it, it will be the biggest trade deal ever made — if we make it.\nBut I view China as somebody that we deal with on the world stage.  I would like to get along with China if we can.  And if we can, that’s great.  If we can’t, that’s okay, too.\nBut what we’re doing is we’re negotiating a very tough deal.  If the deal is not going to be 100 percent for us, then we’re not going to make it.\nAnd I will — and I will say this.  I will say this.  I will say this: China very much wants to make this deal.  China is getting killed.  The tariffs are killing China.  What’s happened is they have now 3 million loss of jobs, their chains are broken up.  If you look at their supply chain, which is a disaster — companies are going to other countries, including us.  China, right now, is a total disaster.\nQ    Mr. President, does a trade with China have anything to do with an investigation into Joe Biden?  And will you ask Xi to investigate?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, no, no.  Let me tell you: I’m only interested in corruption.  I don’t care about politics.  I don’t care about Biden’s politics.  I never thought Biden was going to win, to be honest.  I picked somebody else a long time ago.  And we’ll see what happens.\nBut I never thought Biden was going to win.  But I don’t care.  I mean, frankly, if he won, I’d be very happy.  I think he’d be an easy opponent.  But I never thought Biden was going to win.  I don’t care about politics, but I do care about corruption.  And this whole thing is about corruption.  This whole thing — this whole thing is about corruption.\nThis is about corruption, and this is not about politics.  This is about corruption.  And if you look and you read our Constitution and many other things, we — I have an obligation to look at corruption.  I have an actual obligation and a duty.\nQ    Are you going to comply with the House subpoenas?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  What?\nQ    Are you going to cooperate with the House in this investigation?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I don’t know.  That’s up to the lawyers.  I know the lawyers think they’ve never seen anything so unfair.  They’ve never seen anything so unjust.  I’ve been President now for almost three years, and I’ve been going through this for almost three years.  It’s almost become, like, a part of my day.\nBut in the meantime, we have the best economy we’ve ever had.  We have the best job numbers we’ve had in 51 years.  The best unemployment numbers that we’ve had in a half a century.  The best numbers that we’ve ever had — African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, women — everything.  We have the best numbers that we’ve had in many, many, many decades.\nAnd you know what?  People understand that.  People are working.  They’re making money.  The — if you look at one very important number that was just announced: wages up 3 percent.  That’s unheard of.  That’s unheard of.  So, it’s a great thing.\nQ    What about other Democrats?  What about other Democrats?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I didn’t hear you.  Go.\nQ    Mr. President, when did you first get the idea to investigate the Bidens’ activity in Ukraine?  Who advised you to look into that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’re investigating corruption.  We’re not investigating campaigns.  I don’t care about his campaign.  As I said, I didn’t think — I didn’t think and I don’t think Biden is going to win.  All right?  I don’t think.\nAnd maybe to answer your question, when you say, “Who is going to win?” — I’d rather not make a prediction, but I do have a feeling about it.\nI didn’t think — because I’ve watched Biden over the years, and Biden is not the brightest person.  I never thought he was going to win.  I never felt he was going to win.  If you look at his other two campaigns, he was a one-percenter.  He got very few votes.  He got taken off of the garbage heap by Obama.  Obama took him off the garbage heap.  So it’s one of those things.\nBut I never thought that Biden — I didn’t think Biden was going to win.  I guess that everybody has a shot.  But I don’t think he would be, frankly, my toughest opponent.\nAnd just to finish off — just to finish off, I don’t think that he will win.  I didn’t think he was going to win, and I don’t think he’s going to win.\nQ    Joe Biden’s poll numbers are dropping pretty badly.  Elizabeth Warren’s are rising.  Bernie is sick.  What do you think about facing Elizabeth Warren?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s fine.  I mean, it’s fine.  She’s a socialist and maybe worse than that.  But we’ll see.\nI heard — I haven’t seen his poll numbers.  I haven’t seen Biden’s poll numbers.  Look, Joe Biden was never going to make it.  All right?  He was never going to make it.  He tried it twice.  He’s at 1 percent.  There’s a reason.\nWhen I announced, I went to number one, day one, and I stayed there the entire primary season.  I never was off center-stage.  I was never given credit for that, but that’s okay.  Except by Steve.  The only one that gave me credit was Steve.\nQ    Did you try to talk to Rouhani at the UN?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Who?\nQ    Did you try to talk to Iran’s President?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, they were trying to set up a meeting but he wanted sanctions lifted.  And I said, “You must be kidding.”  We had no interest.  Rouhani wanted a meeting at the UN.  We did talk.  I didn’t speak to him personally, but our sides talked.  He wanted sanctions lifted or partially lifted, and I said no.\nQ    (Inaudible) socialism in Venezuela for political campaign.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’re watching Venezuela very, very closely.  The people are suffering, and we are watching it very closely.  We’re also giving big aid to Venezuela.\nNow, one thing.  I’m now going to Walter Reed Hospital.  We’re going to be giving out five Purple Hearts to unbelievably brave young people.\nAnd I’m going to meet you — some of you are going over.  I don’t know.  I think some of you are going over.  So we could talk further over there.  Although, when we’re there, I would like you to respect the process.  We’re giving out Purple Hearts to very brave people, wounded warriors, people that have been — I mean, they’re just incredible people.  And I’m going to be back here in probably two hours.\nThank you.  Good job.\nEND\n11:06 A.M.

        "text": "Caterpillar, Inc.Green Valley, Arizona\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, hello, Arizona!  (Applause.)  It is great to be here.  What an inspiring place.  How about a big round of applause for the guys in the big trucks behind me.  What a tremendous — what a great job.\nTo Governor Doug Ducey, to Senator Martha McSally, to Jim Umpleby —\nPARTICIPANT:  (Inaudible.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  — who is a fellow Hoosier who actually went to college at a rival college — (laughter) — across the Hoosier State.  And most especially to the men and women of this great company.  Caterpillar is a legendary American company and its best days are ahead here in the Grand Canyon State and all across America.  Thanks for what you do.  (Applause.)  What a great team.\nAnd before I get started, let me also say what an honor it is to be here today with a man you just heard from, a man I just mentioned, and, frankly, someone who I hope you know is simply one of the best governors in the United States of America.  I can honestly say I was for Doug Ducey before it was cool.  (Laughter.)\nWould you join me?  Why don’t you all get on your feet and thank Governor Doug Ducey for all that he’s done for Arizona, for jobs and schools, and for quality of life?  Thank you, Governor.  (Applause.)  What a great guy.\nIt’s also a privilege to be here today with a great American leader — a woman who has dedicated her life to making this country better and more prosperous.  And now she serves in this administration as the Treasurer of the United States of America.  Jovita Carranza, thank you for your service to America and your stalwart support of the USMCA.  (Applause.)\nAnd finally, I know I’m going to say a little bit more about her in a little bit, but I have to tell you: My son is actually a fighter pilot in the Marine Corps.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  And so I’m a little partial to fighter pilots.  (Laughter.)  And I’ll tell you what — if you haven’t figured it out yet, Arizona — she served in the House of Representatives for you, and now she’s emerged already as one of the great leaders in the United States Senate.  Arizona has a fighter in Senator Martha McSally, and we are so grateful for your strong leadership on this issue.  (Applause.)   Thank you, Martha.\nAnd finally, let me bring greetings from a friend of mine who loves that state of Arizona — always be grateful for the support the people of Arizona have afforded us in that election in 2016.  He is a great champion of American manufacturing.  And he’s been working hard to bring manufacturing back since the day we took office.  I bring greetings from the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald Trump.  (Applause.)\nAnd I’m here on this breezy and cool day in Arizona — (laughter) — here in “football weather” — is that right? — just to speak to you on the President’s behalf, and really on behalf of the nation, to say we’ve got an incredible opportunity before us, Arizona.  As I stand before you today, Congress has on their desk the largest trade deal in American history.  And I came here to Tucson, I came to Arizona to say the time has come for Congress to pass the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and pass it this year.   (Applause.)\nWe’re going to talk about trade today — which Caterpillar is a global company, isn’t it?  Selling your products literally all over the world.  American excellence in high relief.  We’re going to talk about Arizona workers and Arizona businesses.\nBut before that, let me reflect on the progress we’ve made because of the confidence the people of Arizona placed in this President and our administration two and a half years ago.  I think there’s only one way you can describe the last two and a half years: It’s been two and a half years of action, two and a half years of results.  It’s been two and a half years of promises made and promises kept.  But we’re just getting started, Arizona.  That’s why we need the USMCA.  (Applause.)\nYou know, at a time when so many in Congress have spent the last two and a half years on endless investigations, trying to overturn the will of the American people in that last election, I’m glad to report to you today, as you’ve already heard from this podium, that there is bipartisan support for the USMCA.  But we need Speaker Pelosi to put the USMCA on the floor of the House of Representatives, and do it this year.  (Applause.)\nThe good news is that, even just yesterday, Speaker Pelosi said that House Democrats were, in her words, on a path to “yes.”  And we want them to keep going on that path.  Let’s get to “yes” on the USMCA and score a victory for jobs in Arizona and America.  Okay?  (Applause.)\nI mean, I think you all know the American people don’t want more partisanship; we want more jobs.  Right?  We don’t want more resistance; we want more results.  The American people want the USMCA to pass and to pass this year.  And I literally have been traveling all over the country — all over the country, Jim — telling this story.\nAnd everywhere I go I hear the tremendous support for the USMCA.  And I’ll make you a promise: Whatever goes on in Washington, D.C., this President, this Vice President, your senator, your governor will not be deterred.  We’re going to keep fighting for jobs.  We’re going to get the USMCA on the floor of the Congress.  (Applause.)  And we’re going to fight until we get it done.\nYou know, we’ve been fighting to keep the promises that President Trump made to the people of Arizona since day one.  I mean, this President promised to rebuild our military, and I’m proud to report that this President has already signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan.  He also promised — (applause) — thank you.\nHe also promised to revive this economy.  And we cut taxes for working families and businesses.  We rolled back red tape.  We’ve unleashed American energy and unleashed an American energy revolution.  And we’ve negotiated free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first.\nAnd I don’t need to tell you here in Arizona, which is a booming state, that the results have been remarkable.  Since Election Day 2016, businesses large and small across this country have created 6.3 million new jobs, including 200,000 good-paying jobs right here in the Grand Canyon State.  How about that?  (Applause.)  That’s great, Governor.\nUnemployment has hit a 50-year low.  And I’m proud to report — as we just began Hispanic Heritage Month all across this country, and I met with great leaders in the Hispanic American community before we left Phoenix this morning — we now have the lowest unemployment ever recorded for Hispanic Americans and African Americans.  The American Dream is working again for every American.  (Applause.)\nI mean, it is — it really is amazing.  And you need look no farther, Jim, than manufacturing to find proof of what’s happening in this economy.  Today, there are more manufacturing job openings in America than any time in the last decade.  In fact, there’s more job openings in manufacturing and across this country today than there are people looking for work.  And last year, we saw a record-high optimism among manufacturers and small businesses, and the most new manufacturing jobs created in more than 20 years.  Now, that’s real different from about three years ago.\nI remember the last President was talking about manufacturing jobs were gone for good.  And I’ve got to tell you: You know, I’m proud of that Caterpillar operation back in Indiana — just as proud as you are here in Arizona, Governor.  And you know, in Arizona, kind of like Indiana, we do two things well; you know, you make things and you grow things.\nAnd we had a President in the last administration who said, “What are you going to?  Are you going to wave a magic wand to get those jobs back?”  They’d actually lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs.  Well, we didn’t need a magic wand, we just needed President Donald Trump in the White House.  (Applause.)  Five hundred thousand manufacturing jobs created all across America, including nineteen thousand jobs right here in Arizona.\nIt’s not just been about more jobs.  It’s also been about better jobs.  I mean, since our Election Day in 2016, I’m proud to report the average American household has seen their income go up by more the $5,000 a year.  Wages are rising at the fastest pace in a decade.\nAnd what’s most exciting to the President and me — while we’d like to see everybody’s income rising, the truth is wages are rising most rapidly for blue-collar, hardworking Americans.  The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more.  (Applause.)  It’s true.\nI mean, we’re seeing success stories all across the country over the last two and a half years.  And for more than 90 years, Caterpillar has been one of America’s best companies.  And, Jim, you and your team are keeping that proud tradition alive.  I’m told Caterpillar — your machines are sold on six continents.  And the United States military is even using them on the seventh continent: Antarctica.  (Laughter.)  And I hope they don’t drive across any thin ice.  (Laughter.)\nCaterpillar’s success story is a — is really a part of the success of this country.  I mean, think about it:  Caterpillar’s machines were used by the Allies during World War Two.  They worked on some of the most iconic projects in American history, like the Golden Gate Bridge, the Hoover Dam, and widening the Panama Canal.  Caterpillar was there.\nIn an extraordinary legacy, you continue today with these new developments and innovations like we just saw with these trucks all behind us.  It really was amazing.  Jim had to point out to me which of the trucks had drivers and which ones didn’t.  And, Jim, I’m actually just kind of glad you didn’t make me stand down there as they were rolling around before you told me that.  But they did an incredible job.\nAnd with this booming economy, I’m also told Caterpillar sales have soared by 42 percent since 2016, and you created 3,000 jobs right here in the United States of America.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Caterpillar.\nBut I think Jim would be the first one to say results like that just don’t happen.  Sure, they’re a result of economic policies that allow companies like this one to keep more of what they earn and reinvest and be free of burdensome regulations.  Sure, that — there’s some credit that goes to opening up markets around the world to what you build here and what you make here.\nBut I know Jim would be the first to say it’s — it’s really about all of you.  And all of you, each and every day, practice the integrity, the craftsmanship, the hard work, and the ingenuity that makes these incredible machines become a reality.\nI mean, the truth is, Caterpillar is prospering, Arizona and America are prospering because of people just like you.  So give yourselves a round of applause.  Great job.  (Applause.)\nAnd there’s all kinds of individual stories.  I’m told there’s another Marine here, who actually was a veteran of the Illinois National Guard.  He served this nation as an anti-aircraft missile launcher technician and now he uses his technical skills gained in the uniform to help customers use Cat’s technology on mining projects all over the world.  He’s been with Caterpillar for 15 years.\nSo, for all he did in the uniform in the United States, and all he’s done to make this company such a great success, would you join me in thanking Justin Sanchez — Justin Sanchez.  Where are you, Sarge?  Stand up.  There you are.  (Applause.)  Thank you, Sergeant.\nI’m told there’s another veteran of the Air Force.  Martha, you’ll be glad to know — another veteran the Air Force.  Also, the Washington Air National Guard, specialized in avionic electronics and repairing preparing radars on A-10s —\nPARTICIPANT:  (Inaudible.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Very good — C-130s, K-135s.\nAnd now she tells the story of Caterpillar’s Surface Mining technology to employees around the world.  So would you join me in thanking her for her service in uniform and her service here?  Where’s Amy Madsen?  Staff Sergeant Amy Madsen, take a bow.  (Applause.)  Great job.  Amy’s got a fan club.  (Laughter.)  That’s great.\nAnd, you know, I recognized the two of them because, frankly, they’re emblematic of all of you.  In fact, in that aspect of their background, they’re like a whole lot of you gathered here today.  I’m told they’re not the only ones at Caterpillar who’ve worn the uniform of the United States.\nSo, how about if you’re a veteran, if you’re able to stand — if you wore the uniform of the United States, would you just mind standing up, letting us show how much we appreciate all you’ve done for our country. Let’s thank our veterans.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks for your service, all.\nAnd thank you all.  Congratulations.  I mean, the remarkable employees here today — like Justin and Amy, and like all of you — show that American workers can compete with anybody, anywhere in the world.\nAnd we’re doing it now today, but the truth is, we can do it even better if we open more markets around the world to what we make, what we manufacture, and what we export from here.  And the good news is the President’s been working on opening up markets around the world since day one.  We renegotiated a trade agreement with South Korea.  We signed the first phase of a new bilateral trade agreement with Japan.  And President Trump put China on notice that the era of economic surrender is over.  We’re going to defend American jobs and American workers.  (Applause.)\nBut closer to home, it brings us to the USMCA.  And I won’t belabor the point; you all know my opinion on it, right?  I mean, the truth is this is a historic agreement.  And it’s an agreement that — it’s a win for every American.  The truth is, according to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA, once it’s signed into law, is going to add about $68 billion to our economy.  And right out of the gate, we think it’s going to create 176,000 American jobs, including nearly 50,000 manufacturing jobs.  And that’s a conservative estimate.\nAnd we’re not just creating more jobs, but better jobs.  The ITC also says that when this trade agreement is passed, American manufacturing workers are going to get another raise, in addition to the wages that are rising already.  American manufacturing is working today.  American manufacturing is going to win even more when we pass the USMCA.  (Applause.)\nSo I want to encourage each and every one of you.  I want to encourage each and every one of you to let your voice be heard.  You know, I served in the Congress of the United States for 12 years before I became Governor of the state of Indiana, and I know that the most powerful voice — the most powerful force, rather — in Washington, D.C., is not one party or another, not some special interest or another, it’s not even the media.  The most powerful force in Washington, D.C., is the voice of the American people.  So, Arizona, let your voice be heard.  (Applause.)\nThis is a time for you to pick up the phone, send an e-mail, tweet, reach out to those who represent Arizona in our nation’s capital.  But I could save you — I can save you some money.  First and foremost, you don’t need to call Senator Kyrsten Sinema, because she’s been out there standing for the USMCA early on.  And you sure don’t need to call Senator Martha McSally.  She is leading the charge in the United States Senate for the USMCA.  (Applause.)\nBut I have to tell you, it’s time — it’s time to reach out.  It’s time to reach out to the rest of the delegation.  Martha was talking about the folks that represent you in Washington, D.C.  And it’s time for you to reach out and make a respectful phone call, and tell people,  You know, I was standing on a hillside outside Tucso- — Tucson and ran into Mike Pence” — (laughter) — “and a whole bunch of big trucks.  And he just told me that this USMCA would be a huge win, not just for the company that I work for, but really for Arizona, and for — and for everybody across this country.”  And just tell them that, you know, the time has come for Congress to set politics aside. The time has come for Congress to vote on the USMCA.  Just call them up and tell them that.  (Applause.)\nAnd you can start right here in Tucson.  You can start right here in Tucson.  Give Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick a call.  Tell her I told you to call.  And tell her you need the USMCA.  And tell her to go tell Speaker Pelosi that when the USMCA comes to the floor, she’s going to cast a vote for Arizona and she’s going to cast a vote for jobs.\nI mean, the truth of matter is that, if all of us will do all we can to send a clear message to our nation’s capital, we’re going to get this done.  We’re going to roll our sleeves up.  Even in these divided times in Washington, D.C., we have an opportunity, men and women, to do something that will be good for every American.  It’ll be something every American, whatever their politics, can rally behind.  So, let your voice be heard and we’ll get the USMCA done.  I promise you, Arizona.  (Applause.)\nSo, thanks for coming out today.  I appreciate it.  I actually skipped through some of my speech because I figured you’d appreciate it too.  (Laughter.)\nBut it really is an honor to be with you.  I have to tell you, for a small town guy from southern Indiana to be here in Arizona and serving as your Vice President is the greatest honor of my life.  So, can I just take this opportunity to say to the people of Arizona: Thank you for the opportunity of serving as your Vice President.  (Applause.)\nI’m grateful on behalf of myself and my family and — I already told the governor, that son of mine is going to be moving to Arizona before too long.  So — (laughter) — you’re going to have a Pence not too far from here, and we’re going to be proud.  We’ll be proud to fly in as quietly as we possibly can, Governor — to visit my son and wonderful daughter-in-law.\nBut I want to thank you for what you’ve done here.  This is an incredible company.  Jim, congratulations again on all your incredible success.  Governor, thank you for leading the state with such energy and conviction and such good-natured winsomeness that you have that’s all about you.  Thank you, Senator McSally for your — for your being a champion for all the people.  And thank all of you.  And thank you, Arizona, for the support that you provided to us and continue to support.\nAnd I promise you — I promise you not just on the USMCA — on behalf of President Donald Trump and I, we’re never going to stop fighting for everything the people of Arizona sent us to Washington to do.  We’re going to make this nation more prosperous than ever before.  We’re going to make this nation safer than ever before.  And I know, with your continued support and with the great example of the people of this company, and with God’s help, we’re going to keep America great.\nThanks, everybody.  God bless you.  God bless Arizona.  And God bless America.  (Applause.)\nEND\n",

Morse Performing Arts CenterOcala, Florida\n1:47 P.M.  EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  Special place.  Really special place.  But where I’m disappointed: I said, “We could have had 25,000 people if we did it outside.”  They said — (applause).  Did you see all the people outside?  They all want your seat.  That’s the way life goes.  (Applause.)  And you’re not giving it up.  I know you too well.  You’re not going to give it up.  Please sit down.  Let’s enjoy it.  Let’s enjoy ourselves.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  We love you, President Trump!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, you got tremendous crowds out there — thank you.  I love your leg.  Look at that, he has my name tattooed on his leg.  (Applause.)  How did you get to The Villages?  How do you get to The Villages?  Huh?  That’s great.\nBut I’m thrilled to be here in one of the most famous and thriving communities anywhere in Florida, and really anywhere in the world, as far as I’m concerned — The Villages.  (Applause.)\nIn fact, I was thinking about moving to The Villages, but I just couldn’t leave Mar-a-Lago.  I couldn’t leave it.  (Laughter.)  I got stuck at Mar-a-Lago.  I don’t know.\nBut this has been a great area for us, and it’s been a great part of our victory.  I don’t know if we got 100 percent, Ron, but it was pretty close, right?  Anybody in there didn’t vote for us, right?  No, we love it.  And we met the folks that built The Villages and that run The Villages, and they’re out here someplace.  And they’ve done a fantastic job.  Where are they?  Where — they’re here some place.  Stand up, please.  (Applause.)  What a job you’ve done.  Great job.  Great job.  And that was started with your grandfather and your father and you folks.  And what a great job you’ve done.\nYou know, in my old days, I would have been jealous.  Now I couldn’t care less about them.  (Laughter.)  It’s amazing.  It’s amazing how being President can do that to you.  (Laughter.)\nSo in my campaign for President, I made you a sacred pledge that I would strengthen, protect, and defend Medicare for all of our senior citizens.  And you see it’s under siege, but it’s not going to happen.  (Applause.)\nToday, I will sign a very historic executive order that does exactly that: We are making your Medicare even better, and we are not letting anyone — it will never be taken away from you.  We’re not letting anyone get close.  (Applause.)\nYou see these people on the other side?  These people are crazy, by the way.  They’re totally crazy.  (Laughter and applause.)  But they want to take it away and give you lousy healthcare.  It’s pretty incredible.  You want to keep your doctors, right?  Remember, with Obama — President Obama, right?  He said, “You can keep your doctor.  You can keep your plan.”  That didn’t work out too well for the people.\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  We’re trying to forget.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Twenty-eight times.  He said he’s trying to forget.  (Laughter.)  You better never forget, okay?  Never forget.\nAs long as I’m President, no one will lay a hand on your Medicare benefits.  And that’s what we’re here to do today.  (Applause.)\nThis order is the latest step in my administration’s drive to ensure the world’s best healthcare for all Americans.  Together, we’re creating a healthcare system that protects vulnerable patients, makes healthcare more affordable, gives you more choice and control, and delivers the high-quality care Americans deserve.  And that’s what we’re doing — we’re strengthening our healthcare system to a level that nobody thought would be possible.\nOur economy is booming.  We’re doing fantastically well.  I think it gets a little bit hurt by politics.  (Applause.)  But our country is so strong and our economy is so powerful that even politics, and even when you have the — the “Do-Nothings” — I call them the — really, the “Do-Nothing Dems.”  They can’t even affect it very much.  (Applause.)\nWe’ve created over 6 million new jobs since the election.  The unemployment rate has reached a 51-year low.  Two point — think of that.  Think of that.  (Applause.)  Then, soon, it’s going to be a historic number, like so many of the other numbers.\n2.5 million people have been lifted out of poverty.  That means more Americans that now have — and that’s what it’s all about — they have a great way of life.  They have affordable healthcare options and millions of seniors are enjoying better, healthier, and more prosperous retirements.  I should be retiring with you.  (Applause.)  I should be in this audience, clapping.  But I didn’t trust anybody to be standing here, because I know what you have.  (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  It’s true.  I didn’t trust anybody.  It’s very important.\nAnd nobody has done more in two and a half years — their first two and a half years — than what we’ve done.  Whether it’s Right to Try, whether it’s tax cuts — no matter what it is, nobody has done we’ve done.  Not even close.\nWe’re delighted to be joined today by a man who is really, really good at — he ran one of the largest drug companies, and really successfully, and I took him out.  Look, that’s where, you know, like — that’s where the money is.  Well, that’s where the knowledge is.\nHe ran one of the biggest, most successful companies.  I said, “Alex Azar, come on out.  I want to get you to be the top person in charge of this.”  I said, “So, let me ask you, how much bigger is this than the company you’re in?”  It’s like hundreds of times bigger.  It’s a monster.  It’s a monster.  And what a job.  Alex Azar, you know who he is.  Where is Alex?  (Applause.)  Wherever you are.  Alex, thank you.\nAnd he works with Administrator Seema Verma, who has been so incredible.  Seema, you have to stand up. What a job.  (Applause.)\nThey know the most intricate little quarter sentences.  You wouldn’t believe it.  I’d say, “What about this?”  And they’d tell me, “Unfortunately, it’s always like a little roadblock, but we figure our way around.”\nAnd somebody else who is going to be lowering your drug prices with us in a very, very short distance.  We’re going to buying them from a slightly different source.  A little bit unconventional.  A lot of people say I’m unconventional; sometimes you have to be unconventional.  (Applause.)\nAnd, Alex, when are we are going to let Governor Ron DeSantis and your incredible First Lady Casey DeSantis — when are they going to be — when are they going to be able to do what we want to do?  (Applause.)  Alex, when are they going to be able to do what we have to do?  “Soon.”  Alex says, “Soon.”  Because they’re going to have a big fat, beautiful surprise for you.  And that has been an incredible couple and a great governor, and the job they’re doing is phenomenal.  And I was honored to be very much involved in that campaign.  (Applause.)\nAnd if he was doing a lousy job, I’d probably just wouldn’t have shown up today.  (Laughter.)  But he’s doing one of the best jobs in the whole country.  Ron DeSantis.  (Applause.)\nAnd also helping Ron and Casey: Jeanette Núñez, your Lieutenant Governor.  Jeanette, thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks, Jeanette.  Great job.\nFlorida Attorney General Ashley Moody.  (Applause.)  Ashley, I saw you down there.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you very much.\nAnd a few warriors we have with us.  You know, Ron was one of our warriors.  He was in Congress and he was fighting the Russian hoax.  That was the Russian witch hunt hoax.  And he was so impressive that when he said, “You know, I’d like to run for governor,” I said, “I’d rather keep you right where you are because they’ll come up with another crazy idea.”  But I’m glad I did it.  And it worked out well.\nBut we have warriors back in Washington, and you have five of them right here.  Gus Bilirakis.  (Applause.)  Gus.  Where’s Gus?  Thank you, Gus.  Great job.  The legendary Neal Dunn.  (Applause.)  Neal, thank you.  These guys are warriors.  Ross Spano.  (Applause.)  Thanks, Ross.  Michael Waltz.  (Applause.)  Michael.  Great job he does on television.  All of them, they do a great job.  They’re defending us.  They’re not defending me; they’re defending us, because that was the greatest election victory maybe in history.  And they’re defending us.  (Applause.)\nAnd a man with one of the best names in the history of politics: Daniel Webster.  (Applause.)  What a name.  If I had that name, I would’ve been President 10 years ago.  (Laughter.)  Thank you.  Thanks, Daniel.  Thanks, everybody.  Great job.\nThey really are — they’re warriors.  They go back and they fight, and they fight corruption.  And it’s corruption, what’s going on right now.  When you see this going on, it’s pure corruption.\nAs we gather this afternoon, Medicare is under threat like never before.  Your know that.  You have people that are running for office who — if it ever happened, you will not be very happy here.\nAlmost every major Democrat in Washington has backed a massive government healthcare takeover that would totally obliterate Medicare.  These Democrat policy proposals may go by different names — they have all of these wonderful names like —\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  Wacko! (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’ll never end.  I’m sorry I smiled.  They’ll have me — the fake news is back there.  Look at all of them.\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They’ll say, “It’s terrible.  It’s terrible — the President’s smile.”  You know, they want me to admonish you.  Who said that?  “Lock her up.”  Stand up, please.  (Applause.)  I’m admonishing you.  Never ever say that again.  That’s okay.  Sit down.  (Laughter.)  He’s admonished, so now they can’t do their fake number on us.  Thank you.\nBut they may go by different names, whether it’s “single-payer” or the so-called “public option,” but they’re all based on the totally same, terrible idea.  They want to raid Medicare to fund a thing called socialism.  Any socialists in the room?  I don’t think so.  Not too many.  Anybody?\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No?  No?  Not too many in The villages.  You don’t — you’re not big on socialism down here, right?  These geniuses — these real estate geniuses that know we’re not — not too good.\nEvery one of these plans involves rationing care, restricting access, denying coverage, slashing quality, and massively raising taxes.  They want to raise your taxes.\nThey also want to have open borders, so the people can just come in and do whatever they want to do.\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And they have no idea who’s coming in, by the way.  They have no idea.  But, you know, when these countries — and now we’re getting along great with the countries.  Mexico gave us 27,000 soldiers guarding our border and the numbers are way down.  (Applause.)  Twenty-seven thousand.  I want to thank Mexico — the government and the President.\nCongressional Democrats’ extreme agenda would destroy our booming economy very quickly.  One of the most disturbing proposals from left-wing politicians involves draining your healthcare to finance the open borders that we just discussed.  That’s how they want to finance it.  Leading Democrats have pledged to give free healthcare to illegal immigrants.  They put foreign citizens who break our laws and endanger our country — they put them way ahead of American citizens like you who obey our laws.\nI will never allow these politicians to steal your healthcare and give it away to illegal aliens.  (Applause.)  And now, in New York, I hear they passed a new regulation that, if you use the word, “illegal immigrant” — did I hear correctly?  They want to charge you a fine of $250,000.  In other words, sell your home in The Villages because you happened to say, “We don’t like illegal immigrants pouring into our country illegally.”  We want people to come into our country legally, through a process.  And we’re all in favor of that.  (Applause.)\nAnd, by the way, the Fake News will cut that last part of the sentence off.  (Laughter.)  They’ll just put the first part.  And they’ll say, “Man, is he rough?  He’s too tough.  I can’t vote for him.”\nA nation must put its own citizens first.  My administration is standing up for American seniors.  (Applause.)  And we’ll always protect the Medicare benefits you earned and paid for.\nIn the last administration, Democrats slashed Medicare by $800 billion dollars to pay for Obamacare.  Not too good — Obamacare.\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Now one of their new proposals, backed by more than 130 Democrat members of Congress, would cost — listen to this number — $32 trillion dollars.  And that’s on the low side — $32 trillion, with a “T”.  We’re beyond the “B’s”, the billions.  And reduce Americans’ household income by $17,000 per year.  Is there anybody in this room that doesn’t mind losing $17,000 a year?  No?  In order to get lousy healthcare.\nThough they use many labels, all of the Democrat plans would devastate our healthcare system.  The fake moderates on the left are telling the same lies they did under the last administration.  But the last administration, frankly, was moderate compared to the maniacs that you’re hearing from today.  These are maniacs.  (Applause.)\nElizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren.  You know, when I used to hit her, I thought she was gone, Ron.  I thought she was gone.  She came up from the ashes.  She emerged.  (Laughter.)  Now, we’re probably going to have to do it again, because I don’t see Sleepy Joe making it, I’ll tell you.  (Laughter and applause.)  No, I thought she was gone.\nUnder this administration, we believe that every American family has a right of choice — you have a right to choose.  Choice.  So important.  Like what we did with the vets.  Choice.  Where they can go out and get a doctor instead of waiting in line for three weeks, four weeks, two months.  (Applause.)  Choice.  And you look at the doctor and you look at the plan that is best for you.\nThe truth is, there is no longer a moderate wing of congressional Democrats.  They’ve gone crazy.  They’ve been hijacked by the radical left.  I mean, these people on the left, these people are —\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  Wacko!  (Laughter.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:   (Laughs.)  Is that the same guy?  I think so.  (Laughter.)  I sort of like him.  I can’t admonish him again.  (Laughter.)  I think it’s the same guy.  Got a powerful voice.\nDemocrat lawmakers are not trying to build up the country; they only want to wreck and destroy all of the things that we’ve built up over the last three and a half years, four years, five years — (applause) — prior to us getting in here.  You look at the stock market numbers from the time of the election, from that November 9th date, go a date later.  Wasn’t November 8 — was that one of the great times?  Huh?  (Applause.)  2016.\nBut go a day later, and you look at the numbers in the stock market up way over 50 percent.  The 401(k)s are doing unbelievably well.  One of these people gets in — your 401(k)s are going to hell, the stock market is going to hell.  Frankly, I think — and I hate to say it — the country is going to go to hell.  (Applause.)\nThey’re consumed by rage and radicalism and insatiable lust for power.  Well, how about Justice Kavanaugh?  They talk about a woman — (applause).  They talk about a woman, about horrible things that he never even thought about.  Horrible, horrible things.  And the following day, they want to impeach him.  And then, the following day, she said, “No, I don’t remember anything.  I don’t remember that.”  And they say, “We don’t care.  We want to impeach him anyway.”  Now, what they’re trying to do is turn his vote liberal.  But he’s a much tougher guy than that.  (Applause.)  I hope.  (Laughs.)  He’s a much tougher guy.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  So are you!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you. Yeah, I better be.  I’ll tell you.  If I weren’t, I wouldn’t be up here right now.  With all that we have to put up with these people, we wouldn’t be here.\nDemocrat healthcare proposals would put everyone into a single, socialist, government-run program that would end private insurance for over 180 million Americans.  I’m sort of smiling to myself as I — as I go through these numbers.  And I’m dealing with people that I know.  I mean, I know the people in this room.  Those are the people.  I grew up with you.  When we were young, I grew up with you.  And now we’re sort of still young at heart, at least.  (Applause.)\nAnd that I’m even talking about socialism is like — it’s just — it’s sort of a weird feeling to be talking to you about “you don’t want to be socialist.”  And you’re probably saying, “Why is he wasting his time?”  (Laughter.)\nBut there’s a movement on.  And it’s not so easy to be beat them when they get up in a debate and they say, “We’re going to cut your college tuition to nothing.  We’re going kno- — knock off $1.6 trillion.  We’re going to do all these other things.  Everything is free, except for your taxes.”  Your taxes are going to go up at a level that nobody has even seen before and that won’t be nearly enough to pay for it.\nBut I’ll not let any of this bad stuff happen.  It’s very important that we win this race.  You know, when we won last time, I said, “That’s the most important election in our country’s history.”  Because we were ready to go over the edge.  (Applause.)\nAnd now our country is doing great.  But, you know, it’s like a plant — it’s like a tree.  It has to grab — those roots have to grab hold.  We still need more time.  We’ve done so much, but we need a little more time.  That thing has to grow and it’s got to get in there and then nobody is going to be able to take it down no matter what happens later on.  So important. (Applause.)\nIn America, we believe in freedom and liberty, not government domination and government control.  Today, standing in solidarity with our nation’s seniors, I declare once again that America will never be a socialist country — it will never be.  (Applause.)  Thank you.\nAUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You want to drive them crazy?  Don’t do “four more years.”  Say “eight more years.”  You’ll drive them crazy.  (Laughter.)\nOne of these crazy maniacs on a show was interviewing somebody — radical Left — and he goes, “You know he’s going to win, don’t you?”  Big show.  And the guy goes, “No, no.  We’re going to fight him.  We’re going to…”  “No, no, no.  He’s going to win.  And you know he’s never getting out.  You know that don’t you?”  (Laughter.)  “He’s not going to get out.  You know he’s…”\nAnd I thought, like — you know, he’s a comedian.  I thought he was like kidding and having fun.  He meant it.  (Laughter.)  These people are sick.  They meant it.\nAnyway — but, no, if you want to drive them crazy, just say “eight more years” or “twelve more years” — (laughter) — or “sixteen.”  Sixteen would do it good.  They would — (laughter) — you would really drive them into the loony bin.  (Applause.)\nAnd that’s why they do the impeachment crap, because they know they can’t beat us fairly.  That’s the only reason they’re doing it.  They can’t win.  They can’t win.  (Applause.)  If they won, it would be a sad day for our country.  It’ll be a sad, sad day for our country if they ever won.\nAmong those who would be hit hardest by the socialist takeover are 24 million seniors on Medicare Advantage — a lot of you.  One out of two Hispanic seniors, one out of three African-American seniors is enrolled in Medicare Advantage.  This very popular Medicare program — been around for a long time — allows private plans to compete to offer senior citizens the absolute best healthcare.  They want to destroy it.\nWhile many Democrat plans would eliminate Medicare Advantage, my administration is fighting to make it even better and much, much stronger. (Applause.)\nAnd thanks to our efforts, there are nearly 1,200 more Medicare Advantage plans today than there were just two years ago.  Think of that.  (Applause.)  Premiums have plummeted by 28 percent; they’ve gone down.  And they’re now at the lowest level in over 10 years.\nWith us today is Corey Spangler.  She lives just up the road in Summerfield.  Corey, please tell us some of what we’ve been discussing on Medicare Advantage and your plan, and how important it is to you.  Please, come up, Corey, wherever you may be.  Oh, Corey.\nMS. SPANGLER:  I’m right here.  (Laughter and applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Corey.\nMS. SPANGLER:  Okay.  My family came to America from Mexico when I was five years old because my father did not like the corruption and we had socialized medicine there.  He came to this country legally.\nAnd when I turned 65, I had some heart issues.  I went to the doctor.  They scheduled me with a cardiologist.  He scheduled me for a stress test on a Wednesday.  Pass — I didn’t — I failed that test.  So he scheduled me for a heart cath the next day.  I failed that.  They told me you need to have a bypass and I was going to have five bypasses done.\nThe following Monday, I was in surgery with my five pass — five bypasses, and I went home the following Friday.  This would never happen with Medicare for All.  I love my Medicare Advantage plan, because I can choose the doctor, when I need it, and get the care I need in a quickly manner.  And it wouldn’t happen with Medicare for All.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s beautiful.\nMS. SPANGLER:  Thank you, Mr. President, for saving my care — healthcare.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Corey.  (Applause.)\nI see a future politician there.  That was — (laughter) — boy, she was so like calm.  No nerves.  You know, sometimes I’ll see people, they get a little bit nervous.  Very good.\nWhat a job they’ve done.  Great doctors.  Did you choose your own doctor or you get lucky with a good doctor that was recommended?\nMS. SPANGLER:  They were wonderful.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They were wonderful.  That’s fantastic.  And you’re wonderful.  Thank you, Corey.  Appreciate it.  (Applause.)\nThe Democrat plans for socialized medicine will not just put doctors and hospitals out of business, they’ll also deny your treatment and everything that you need.  Government-run healthcare systems always end up imposing rationing.  You see what happens.\nYou look at Venezuela; take a look at that.  Fifteen years ago, it’s one of the wealthiest countries.  Now they don’t have food.  They don’t have water.  The hospitals are a disaster.  No electricity.  No anything.  It’s very sad.  And we’re helping the people as much as we can.  But we’re watching that whole situation — beyond this, we’re watching it very, very carefully.   We’re watching it very carefully.  And Cuba — we’re watching Cuba very carefully.  Very, very carefully.  (Applause.)\nBut as an example, under the United Kingdom’s single-payer system, patients wait 117 days to receive, as an example, a knee replacement.  One hundred and seventeen days.\nIn Canada, wait times for orthopedic surgery are over 270 days.  But currently in the United States, wait times for these surgeries are — we’ve speeded it up a lot — are typically less than two weeks.  Is that right, Alex?  (Applause.)\nAnd I have many people coming down from Canada, and I say, “What are you doing?”  They’re getting an operation of some kind.  “Why don’t you get it up there?”  They said, “There’s nothing like what you’ve been able to do in a short period of time.”  And we’re making it even better.\nWith us today is Charles McLaughlin, a 71-year-old Floridian and a Marine veteran of the Vietnam War.  Charles, please come up and tell us your story.  Please.  (Applause.)\nMR. MCLAUGHLIN:  Oh, man.  (Applause.)\nHello to The Villages!  What a great place you guys have here.  Wow.  I understand that approximately 60 percent of all of you are veterans.  I want to say thank you for your service.  (Applause.)  And to my Vietnam brothers and sisters: Welcome home.\n(Applause.)  Welcome home.\nMy name is Chuck McLaughlin, and I’m a Vietnam combat Marine.  I’m also a cancer survivor — Stage 4 style.  I know a lot about Medicare and the supplement.  I used it for breathing tubes, feeding tubes, stitches, staples, MRIs, PET scans, CAT scans, blood tests, hydration shots, chemo treatments, radiation treatments, six months of hypobaric chamber — to name a few.\nAnyone that’s cured, like me, loves their doctors.  Loves their doctors.  (Applause.)  I also want to say: My family, financially, would’ve been destroyed without Medicare.  Destroyed.  The facts are now (inaudible) the politicians on the left are pushing Medicare for All.  I say the result will be no Medicare at all.  It will collapse under the load — the load of the system.  It will overload of it.  The lines would be incredible.  Who knows?  I probably wouldn’t be here.\nAs far as free stuff, it may be free stuff, but it’s going to come out of somebody else’s pocket.  There’s no such thing as “free.”  Period.  (Applause.)\nIs the Medicare system perfect?  No.  But it worked for me.  Remember, I paid my share.\nJust a few thoughts: President Trump’s plan of Medicare Advantage will give me more flexibility for options to this system.  I can pick and choose my needs.  Secondly, a program that helps protect us seniors for a fair shake as our bodies fail us.  And number three, we must get rid of the waste and fraud that seems to be in the newspapers weekly.  Finally, thank you, President Trump, for all you do.  (Applause.)\nI want to personally thank him for what he does for our veterans.  (Applause.)\nFinally, and may God bless you and your family for loving America and giving us a renewed hope for our children and our grandchildren.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  What a great job.  Well, thank you very much, Charles.  And it’s incredible.  You’ve gone through a lot.\nMR. MCLAUGHLIN:  Yep.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You don’t look it.  (Laughter.)  He’s looking handsome to me, I’ll tell you.  (Laughter.)  Thanks, Charles.  That’s incredible.\nLike you, all of us today understand the truth.  Socialism is not about improving the health of American people; it’s about wielding power over the American people, taking things away from the American people.  (Applause.)\nIn a few moments, I will sign an executive order to strengthen Medicare for seniors, and very substantially.  I’ll provide Medicare Advantage plans with new tools and options, and it will help Medicare beneficiaries gain faster access to the very latest and greatest medical devices and therapies.\nMy order also pursues reductions in the unnecessary regulations that you don’t need, you don’t want to see — that never come into effect and that cost a lot of money — enabling doctors and nurses to spend less time on paperwork and more time with their patients that they love.  (Applause.)\nTo further protect seniors, we are taking action to stop fraud and to stop abuse.  It’s tremendous amounts of money saved with that.  And we’ll be able to put that money right back into what we want to have it to take care of you.\nI’m directing Secretary Azar to crack down on criminals, cheaters, and dishonest providers who rob Medicare of the funds you have and the money that you’ve paid into the system all of your lives.  Charles said it.  Charles said, “You know, I paid for it.”  He said he paid for it.  And now they want to say, “Let’s give it to everybody else.”  And it’s going to be gone in a very short number of years.  But you did pay for it.  You both paid for it.\nToday’s action is the only really great action that we can take.  It’s the only choice we have because this is going to be something that’s better than any place anywhere in the world.  It’s the latest of many important steps that we’re taking to dramatically improve healthcare for the American people.\nOur vision for the future of health in America has four crucial parts.  And we will protect vulnerable patients, number one.  We will protect those patients that are so terribly vulnerable.  We will deliver the affordability that you need.  Prices coming down.  As I said, prescription drug prices — first time in over 50 years, Alex, that drug prices have come down for the year.  (Applause.)  Your average prescription drug price — first time in 50 years — over 50 years.\nAnd we’re going to get them a lot lower.  And I think Ron is going to have some big surprises.  We’ll be announcing that pretty soon.  Some — for really, really big reductions.  People are already — they’re not even going to know what happened.  So that’s what we want.  (Applause.)\nAnd we’re going to give you options and control that you want.  And we will provide the quality you deserve.\nFirst, we’re protecting vulnerable Americans.\nWe have made a clear promise to America’s patients: We will always protect patients with preexisting conditions.  (Applause.)  The Republicans will always protect preexisting conditions.  (Applause.)\nTo stop families from being blindsided by outrageous medical bills — and this is something that is one of the most exciting things to me — I have challenged Congress to send a bill to my desk that stops the horrendous practice of surprise medical billing.  So many of you, you go in and you have something, and then you get a bill and you say, “How is it possible?”  And we’re going to end that practice.  That practice is not a fair practice.  (Applause.)\nAnd we’re also confronting the opioid and drug addiction epidemic that is plaguing too many American communities.  And thanks to our efforts — and we’ve worked so hard on it; the First Lady worked so hard.  Kellyanne Conway — where’s Kellyanne?  (Applause.)   Where’s Kellyanne?  Where is she?  Kellyanne, thank you.  Thank you, Kellyanne.  (Applause.)\nLast year, drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly three decades.  Early data shows that drug overdose deaths dropped 10 percent last year in the state of Florida.  Now, think of that.  That’s — you know, we’d like to better.  It’s a very, very tough situation.  And one of the things we’re doing with the “pain pills” — we can call them — we’re trying to find, and we’re really working hard and we’re funding a lot of research to find pain pills that aren’t addictive.  You go into to a hospital with a broken arm, and you come out and you’re drug addict.  And we’re trying to find, and we’re getting closer — I think we’re getting very close, actually — to finding painkillers that aren’t addictive.  And we’ll have that in the not-too-distant future.  (Applause.)\nAnd to care for our great veterans, we passed VA Accountability.  You know what that is, right?  This is where the great heroes and tough people — but — and, by the way, in their super prime, nobody touched them.\nBut they’re more vulnerable, and people would take advantage of our veterans.  You had sadists.  You had people that would rob them and rob the system.  You had some horrible people.   We couldn’t fire anybody.  They had, in Arizona, people that got stealing — they got caught stealing $400,000.  They couldn’t fire them.  So now we have VA Accountability.  You think that was easy?  They’ve been trying to get it for 50 years.  And I got it.  I’m good at getting things.  (Applause.)\nSo now, when they don’t take proper care of our vets, we say, “Jim, get the hell out of here.  You’re fired.  Get out of here.”  (Applause.)  We can fire them.  Get them out.  We get them out.  We don’t have to ask questions.  We get them out.  If they’re bad, they treat our veterans badly, we fire them.  That’s why you don’t hear about — you know, before me, every night you’d see these stories, these horror stories about the VA.  I haven’t seen one in a long time.  Now, I don’t want to wish it because the fake news will search the system — (laughter) — to find somebody that’s not happy.  “We found somebody.  We found a vet in Florida who isn’t quite happy with everything.  Let’s do a major story.”\nBut do you remember all of the bad stories that used to be about the VA?  Now you don’t see that because they have accountability.  We can fire bad people.  We fired a tremendous number of really bad people that should’ve been fired years ago.  (Applause.)\nI don’t like firing people, but I like firing people that don’t treat our vets great, that aren’t doing their job.  And they were protected, frankly, by the unions, and they were protected by civil service — very powerful.  Do you think it was easy beating unions and civil service?  Not too easy.  But I explained to them too.  I said, “This is good for all of us.  It’s good for America.”\nAnd the other, as I said, is VA Choice, where our veterans no longer have to wait for endless, endless hours, days — even months.  We’ve had cases where a person is on line — not bad; could be fixed up very easily with whatever treatment it may be — and they end up being terminal by the time they see a doctor.  That’s not happening anymore.  (Applause.)  Because now you go out, you find a great local doctor, we pay the bill.\nAnd, you know, it’s interesting, it’s totally less important but we also save a lot of money on that.  Hard to believe, we save a lot of money.  It’s much less expensive for us to do that than the other way, and it’s saving tremendous numbers of lives.  And we have great doctors, frankly, that need the business.  Not so bad.\nTo protect healthcare for our seniors and all Americans, my administration is taking strong actions to ensure that newcomers to our society do not drain our healthcare system, or burden the services that you depend on.  You see these people in California, the governor of California — “Come on in, everybody.”  Then you wonder why people are flooding our borders. “Come on in.  You have free education, free healthcare.  Everybody gets a Rolls-Royce.”  (Laughter.)  “Come on in.  Come on in.”\nYou know, to show you how corrupt CNN is, when I used that expression, they said, “The President wasn’t telling the truth.  He said they get a Rolls-Royce and they don’t.”  (Laughter.)  Ahh, they don’t get it, do they?  They never got it.\nSome idiot at CNN said, “You can’t win without CNN.  I guess we showed them.” (Laughter and applause.)  I guess we showed them.  (Applause.)  And their ratings are so low now that they are no longer the big difference at all.  They have really bad ratings.\nBut you know what is bad for our country?  When CNN — so often I go to a foreign country.  I go to a country.  I meet leaders.  And he said, “Why do they hate your country so much?”  I said, “Who?”  You know, CNN outside of the United States is much more important than it is in the United States.  And a lot of what you see here is broadcast throughout the world.  And we used to have Radio Free — I think Radio Free Europe and Voice of America.  And we did that to build up our country.  And that’s not working out too well.\nBut CNN is a voice that really seems to be the voice out there.  And it’s a terrible thing for our country.  And we ought to start our network and put some real news out there because they are so bad.  (Applause.)  They are so bad for our country.  They are so bad for our country.  I go out there and they say, “Boy, the media hates your country.”  And it’s just a shame.  It’s just a shame.  And we really are — we are looking at that.  We should do something about it, too.  Put some really talented people and get a real voice out there, not a voice that’s fake.\nWhen Americans are struck by natural disaster, like they were in Florida where I was with you, Hurricane Michael — did I do a good job, Governor?  Did I do a good job?  (Applause.)  Man.\nYour governor came to my office once a week.  He always needed more money — (laughter) — and I always gave it, right?  He didn’t stop.  I hated it.  I said, “Keep DeSantis.  I don’t want to see him anymore.”  (Laughter.)  But we always gave it, and you got it.  And your people worked so hard.  And FEMA and the military, they all worked with you.  The Coast Guard is incredible, what the Coast Guard has done.  (Applause.)  I think the Coast Guard has really done a great job.\nThe second part of our healthcare agenda is to promote the affordability of America’s needs.  Thanks to our focus on lower drug prices, the FDA approved more low-cost generic drugs in my first two years than ever before in the history of our country. Think of that.  Think of that.  (Applause.)\nAnd every time I’d see the folks over at FDA, I’d say, “Come on, fellas.  Let’s go.  Faster.  Faster.”  You know, don’t forget, when somebody was dying and we had a drug that looked like it was really good but it wasn’t going be approved for like four more years — it used to be 12 years and we brought it way down.  I mean, it’s too long.  But we brought it way, way down.  But a person is dying and they said, “No, sir, we can’t give that because it may harm the person.”  I said, “Wait a minute, you don’t understand.”  (Laughter.)  “A person is terminally ill, they’ve got four weeks to live, and you don’t want to give them a drug because you think it’s going to harm them?  I guarantee you I can get them to sign a document.”  (Laughter.)\nNow we got that approved — Right to Try.  And, by the way, miracles are happening.  Right?  Miracles.  (Applause.)  Miracles are happening.\nHopefully, it never happens to anybody in this room.  But, frankly, people would go to Asia, they’d go to Europe, they’d go all over the world seeking a cure, if they had money.  If they didn’t have money, they’d go home and they’d die.  But now they don’t have to do that.\nAnd it wasn’t easy because the drug companies didn’t want it because they didn’t want to have terminally ill because it looks bad on the percentage record, right?  The insurance companies didn’t want it because there are a lot of reasons.  You know what the reasons are.  Our government didn’t want it because they didn’t want to be sued by a patient that died that would’ve died anyway.  So I said, “Here’s what we do, folks: We sign an agreement.  And the agreement holds everybody non-liable.”\nWe took the drug companies and we created a separate list, so they’re not on that list — because it is, right?  It’s a problem.  And we took a separate list.  So now we have a totally separate list — confidential list — but they don’t get hurt by somebody that was so sick that this person may not make it.  And I got everybody to sign it and we were done.  It was pretty amazing.  And then we got it approved in Congress because of these five great congressmen back there, including Ron, who at the time was in Congress.  (Applause.)  Right?  With Greg and everybody, we got it done and we got the Senate to approve it.  And I signed it.  And I was really happy.  Right to Try.  Hopefully you never need it.\nWe also ended the terrible gag clauses that prevented pharmacists from telling you about cheaper options at the pharmacy counter.  Do you believe it?  I thought this was — I thought they were kidding me the first time.  Don’t forget, I’ve only been doing this for three years, okay?  So, you know.  (Laughter.)\nThese guys have been doing it a long time.  But they’re not allowed to talk to you about pricing.  I said, “Wait.  You’ve got to be kidding.”  And they weren’t.  But I got rid of that.  Now they can talk about pricing.  You can go out and price.  You can go to different places.  They have to be open and transparent.  That was a big deal.  (Applause.)  That was a big deal.  (Applause.)\nAnd all of these things, you know, they sound so simple; they’re tough to get.  They’ve been that way for many years for a reason.  You have very powerful lobbyists.  You have drug companies, frankly, that don’t want that.  Why would they want that, where you can negotiate price?  Why would they want a thing like that?\nMy administration is also working to require drug companies to disclose prices in their television advertisements.  And we’re almost getting to a point where we’re going to be able to get that.   So you’re going to know what you’re paying up front.  They can’t triple-hit you.  (Applause.)\nEssentially, we’re holding Big Pharma accountable.  And that’s okay; they do just fine.\nEarlier this year, we announced another groundbreaking action seniors have wanted for decades.  We will soon allow the safe and legal importation of prescription drugs from other countries, including the country of Canada, where, believe it or not, they pay much less money for the exact same drug.  (Applause.)  Stand up, Ron.  Boy, he wants this so badly.  (Applause.)\nNo, I mean, you go to some countries and the price is like 50, 60 percent lower — even more than that, I guess, Ron, in some cases.  And it’s 50, 60 percent lower — the exact same pill, from the exact same factory, from the exact same company.  And I say, “Why is it that in Europe — certain places, in particular — it’s 25 percent of what we pay back here?”  I said, “It must be a different manufacturer.”  “No, sir, it’s the same one.”  “Must be made in a different factory.”  “No, sir, it’s the same one.”  Everything is identical; they pay 25 percent.  We pick up all of the research and development.  We pick up everything like a bunch of, excuse me, schmucks.  (Laughter.)  Schmucks.  Right?  (Applause.)\nNot anymore, folks, because in a little while — (applause) — in a little while, your governor is going to be able to go out and negotiate until his heart is content.  And he’s going to go to Canada.  I know he’s gone there already and he’s looking at their pricing, and he’s going to some of the European countries and others, and he’s going to get his drug price down to a level that you can’t believe.  It’s going to be a great thing.  And we’ll see what happens.  It’s going to be very interesting.  (Applause.)\nAnd I have a feeling when that happens, the drug companies are just going to say, “We can’t have this.”  And they’re going to drop their price, I think.\nNow, they’re very smart.  They may go the other way, and if they do, don’t blame me, okay?  (Laughter.)  But I’m pretty sure you’re going to do fantastically, Ron.  You feel good about it?  Huh?  You better do good; otherwise, you’re making us both look bad.  (Laughter.)  You hear that, Casey?\nAmerican patients must no longer be forced to subsidize lower drug prices in other countries through higher prices in America.  That’s what we were doing.  We were paying a much higher price.  My administration will never stop fighting for lower costs for American patients and American seniors.\nThe third part of our healthcare vision is to provide the choice and control Americans want.  We eliminated Obamacare’s horrible, horrible, very expensive and very unfair, unpopular individual mandate.  A total disaster.  That was a big penalty.  (Applause.)  That was a big thing.  Where you paid a lot of money for the privilege of not having to pay a lot of money for the privilege of having no healthcare.  You paid not to have healthcare.  It was a penalty.  And how it ever held up in Supreme Court, I don’t know, but it did.  But we just got rid of it.  We just did it the old-fashioned way: We got rid of it.\nWe vastly expanded affordable insurance options, including association health plans, short-term plans, and health reimbursement arrangements — which are incredible.  And many of these options are up to 60 percent less expensive than “O-bomb-a-care.”  (Applause.)  Nobody got that.  (Laughs.)  Nobody got that.  That’s okay.  “O-bomb-a-care.”  I didn’t say “Obamacare.”  I said “O-bomb-a-care.”  (Laughter.)  President “O-bomb-a-care.”  He can have it.\nBut we’ve done a great job in running it.  We almost had it done.  We unfortunately had one vote — middle of the night — just when thumbs down.  That wasn’t good.  After years and years of campaigning — “repeal and replace,” right?  But we’ve done a great job because we get rid of the individual mandate.  And we’re running it better.  It’s still no good, because it’s too expensive.  The premium is way too high and all of the elements of it.  It’s just not good.  But we’re coming up with an incredible plan that if the Republicans take back the House, keep the Senate, keep the presidency, we’re going to have a fantastic plan.  (Applause.)  Right?\nFollowing my administration’s recommendation, Florida has taken an important step to lower cost and increase choice by repealing a misguided Certificate of Need law, used by hospitals to block competition.  We encourage other states to follow Florida’s example.  They’ve done a great job right here.  (Applause.)\nAnd I also signed, just recently, a revolutionary executive order requiring price and quality transparency.  And the man who’s really the leader in the world of this — it’s transparency.  You can pick your doctor; you can look at their records; you can see how well they did.  You can go and negotiate.  A man — what really sold me on it — the man who’s the best in the world at it, who we used, and we gave you the max plan.  Did we give that?  The max plan, right?  That’s the maximum plan.  We gave it to you.  And he said something that I loved.  He said, “Sir, this is more important and will go down as more important than any healthcare that you’ll ever come up with.”  And I said, “I like the sound of that.”  Now, who knows if it’s true, but I guess, from what I’m hearing, they’ve done it in certain limited areas and it’s phenomenal.\nAnd it’s really transparency.  And you’ll be able to negotiate all over the place.  And you’ll be able to pick everything you want, from the hospital to the doctor.  And it’s going to save you a tremendous amount of money.  And there are those that say it’s more important than even healthcare at a high — at a high level.\nAnd fourth, my administration is fighting to ensure the high-quality care that Americans deserve.  Americans have to get the highest quality.  So we have the highest quality that Americans deserve.\nOn behalf of 5 million Americans living with Alzheimer’s disease, I signed into law a $1 billion increase in funding for critical Alzheimer’s research.  And we’ve made a lot of progress.  (Applause.)\nAnd just one other thing I will tell you — because it even surprised me — but we’ve funded it now, and, within 10 years, our country will be AIDS-free.  Can you believe that?  AIDS-free.  (Applause.)  Tremendous progress has been made.\nAnd when we were talking about that, I said, “I don’t understand.  How does this…”  It’s like somewhat of a secret, but it’s incredible — the tremendous progress that we’ve made over the last few years on AIDS and AIDS research.  And we should be essentially AIDS-free.  Do you agree with that, Mr. Secretary?\nIn my State of the Union, I announced a plan to invest — (laughs) — she liked it — $500 million dollars in new treatments, and cures, and all of the things that we have to go through with our incredible children, in some cases, for childhood cancers.  It’s a tremendous problem.\nAnd to bring new hope to the nearly 100,000 Americans currently awaiting a kidney operation, I signed an executive order that will significantly increase the supply of kidneys available for transplant.  It’s such a big deal.  It’s so big.  You have no idea.  (Applause.)\nAnd we worked hard on that.  And, you know, what a lot of people don’t know — a lot of it is just the work.  The people die fairly quickly because it’s not — they could go on forever.  But it’s — it’s unbelievable amounts of work, going in all the time for step-by-step — what you have to do.\nAnd so, with kidney transplants, we’re making tremendous progress.  And we funded a lot of money toward it.  And I think it’s going to be a tremendous thing for people that are just literally suffering with something they can really do very well with.\nWe’re delivering better, fairer, and more affordable healthcare for all Americans, especially our cherished senior citizens.  And we will stop at nothing to deliver better healthcare for you and for your family.  I will never let you down.  You have been incredible to me and I will never ever forget you.  I will never let you down.  I promise that.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you very much.\nWe’re lowering the cost of prescription drugs, taking on the pharmaceutical companies.  And you think that’s easy? It’s not easy.  It’s not easy.  They come at you from all different sides.  I wouldn’t be surprised if the hoax didn’t come a little bit from some of the people that we’re taking on.  They’re very powerful.  They spend a lot of money — spend, I think, more money than any other group in the world actually, in terms of lobbying and lobbying abilities.\nAnd I wouldn’t be surprised if some of the nonsense that we all have to go through, but that I go through — wouldn’t be surprised if it was from these — some of these industries like pharmaceuticals that we take on because I want — I don’t care.  I did great.  I’ve had a great life.  I want to get drug prices down.  I don’t care about the companies I want to get drug prices down.\nI want to continue to give them the incentive to come out with new and better answers, but got to get drug prices down.  And they’ve made a fortune over the last 40 years.  They’ve made so much money.  And they’ve got the system wired.  Because everything you do, their stock goes up.  I said, “What the hell is going on?  Their stock just went up.”  They said, “Sir, it’s going to be wonderful.”  I said, “It’s not going to be wonderful.”  Let their stock go down a little bit.  But their stock goes up.  And what we’ve done is incredible.\nAnd, by the way, you have some incredible companies.  The answers that they — we — we want to keep them strong and powerful and wealthy, and we want them to con- — really continue to do that research.  But we got to get those prices down.  They’re far too high, especially when you compare them to other countries.\nAnd we want to ensure access to the doctors of your choice.  And every day, we are going to — as I said, we are going to defend Medicare like Medicare has never been defended again.  And it’s never needed the defense.  It’s always been incredible.  It’s something that worked and they want to destroy it.\nIn my administration, we know that Medicare is personal.  Great healthcare is about more time with the ones you love, more days with your grandkids, and more freedom to enjoy the most rewarding years of your life — or what should be, by far, the most rewarding years of your life.  You’ve worked hard.  You’ve worked so hard.  And you paid for it.  And you’ve got to enjoy it.  It’s about getting better when you’re sick, it’s improving your well-being, and it’s getting the treatment you need, right when you need it.\nThat’s why, in everything we do, we are defending the principles that made America the envy of the world and the American way of life the greatest in our history.  And our country has never been greater than it’s been right now.  Our military is the strongest it’s ever built — we rebuilt our entire military.  (Applause.)\nAnd even medical research is at a new level.  It’s at a level that we’ve never had it before.\nWe stand for freedom.  We stand for choice.  We stand for justice, and fairness, and accountability.  We stand for loyalty to our citizens, love for our country, allegiance to our flag, and long and healthy lives for our great seniors.  (Applause.)\nAnd with your help, we are going to continue building the best, most advanced, most cutting-edge healthcare system anywhere in the world.  We are going to expand our growing economy to make retirement easier, and better, and far more secure.  We’re going to defend American lives, American values, American families, and America’s glorious destiny.  There is no country like our country.  (Applause.)  We see and read things, but there is no country like our country.  Right?\nWith every ounce of strength and every bit of soul, we are going to protect Medicare for you — for everyone at The Villages, and for every senior across this magnificent land.\nYou are going to be protected in many ways — but you are going to be protected.\nThank you very being here.  Thank you for this incredible enthusiasm.  God bless you.  God bless our senior citizens.  And God bless America.  Thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you.\nOkay.  Should I do it?  (Applause.)  I’ll do it.  All right.\n(The executive order is signed.)  (Applause.)\nThank you everybody.  Here — grab these, fellas.  Pass them around.  The congressmen don’t want (inaudible), and I know that.  Here you go.  I love that.  I love that.  I love those guys.  “Bikers for 45.”  These guys.  (Laughter and applause.)  They’ve been there from the beginning, right?  Here.  Pass them around.  Pass these around, fellas.  Pass them around.\nCome here.  Attorney General, get over here.  Come on.  Get over here.  Lieutenant Governor, come on.  Please, both of you.  Come on up here.  They’re doing a good job, right?  Should we give them a pen?  I think so.  (Applause.)  Come on up here.  That’s great.\nI want to thank you all.  Really a special time.  And this is — this is very meaningful for me and for you and for everybody.  Thank you all very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nEND\n2:49 P.M.

        "text": "First Baptist Church of ScottsdaleScottsdale, Arizona\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you all for coming out.  It’s great to be in Phoenix at a time when this city, this state, and this nation are experiencing an economic boom, the likes of which the American people haven’t seen for a very long time.\nThanks to the policies that Senator McSally has supported throughout her career and Governor Ducey has been advancing here in Arizona, we’ve seen over the last two and a half years, 6.3 million jobs created.  Hundreds of thousands of jobs created here in Arizona.\nAnd as we started today celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month, it was a special joy to be able to reflect on the fact that more than 2 million of those jobs have gone to Hispanic Americans.  And particularly, Hispanic women have been winning in this economy almost more than any other individual group.\nTalking about the fact that under President Trump’s leadership, with our strong allies in the Senate and also at state capitols around the country, we’ve been able to cut taxes, roll back regulations at a historic level, unleash American energy, fight for the kind of free and fair trade deals that’ll expand jobs and opportunity in this country.  And the results really speak for themselves.\nBut as the President often says, for all of the progress that we’ve made — 6 million new jobs, a booming economy — that’s just what President Trump calls “a good start.”  And so I’ll be traveling with the Governor and Senator McSally down to Tucson today to make one more case for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.  And while we see Congress once again heading down the pathway of controversy and endless investigations, we believe the time has come for Congress to set aside politics and pass the USMCA.\nThe United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement was negotiated and finished roughly a year ago.  And ever since that time, Congress has been looking at it, studying it, discussing it.  Yet all the while, Mexico and Canada have both taken decisive steps to put what will be the largest trade deal in American history into effect.\nA conservative estimate of the impact on our economy is that USMCA will create more than 175,000 good-paying jobs all across this country.  And we really believe, in a very real sense, it also ends the incentive of American businesses to move south of the border, and also it protects intellectual property rights and deals with issues, even including the environment that previous trade agreements have never done in a significant way.\nThe USMCA is a win for American jobs.  It’s a win for American workers.  And I specifically want to thank Governor Ducey for being a national voice in support of the USMCA.  And we’ll be traveling to Tucson to make that case because we have tremendous momentum in this economy.  We’ve seen manufacturing come roaring back.  And in every aspect of this economy, we know the USMCA is going to continue to build on that momentum.\nSo it’s great to be here in Arizona.  We look forward to being back again and again.  And it’s also, finally, especially great to be here with Senator Martha McSally who is, in her own right, an American hero, a woman who made history in the Armed Forces of the United States, served with great distinction in the House of Representatives working with this administration, and, I can tell you, has already emerged as a preeminent leader in the Republican majority in the United States Senate.  And she has President Trump and my full support.  We look forward to standing with her all the way through a great day a year from this November in Arizona and around the country.\nQ    Mr. Vice President, sir, you alluded to a politics of endless investigations.  Perhaps you’ll forgive me for asking about it.  Can you say what you spoke about with President Zelensky when you met with him in Poland, and whether the Bidens came up — whether you mentioned the Bidens at all with him?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, as I said the day after that meeting, we focused entirely, in my meeting with President Zelensky of Ukraine, on the issues that President Trump has raised as a concern, namely the lack of support from European partners for Ukraine and real issues of corruption in Ukraine.\nBut the American people have every right to ensure that when we’re investing hundreds of millions of dollars to support the territorial integrity and the sovereignty and the security of Ukraine, that those dollars are being spent in a way that’s honest and represents a government free of corruption.\nThe good news is President Zelensky was elected last spring on an anti-corruption message.  And before the summer was out, he elected a large majority in his parliament also on a message of anti-corruption.  And when we spoke roughly a month ago in Poland, President Zelensky reported to me the literally hundreds of bills on corruption reform that his party was introducing and moving; the steps that he was taking to deal with corruption in Ukraine.  And also committed to me that he would work with the United States to call on our European partners to do more, to push back on Russian aggression — the Russian aggression that essentially took over Crimea and also has fomented war in the Donbass area of Ukraine now for years.  And those were the topics that we discussed.  That was all we discussed.\nBut the simple truth is that those are the same issues that the President raised with President Zelensky in their call.  Now, the President spoke about lack of European support, he spoke about corruption, and he tasked me to go and to meet with the President of Ukraine and carry our concerns about those issues.\nAnd anyone that looks at the President’s transcript will see that the President was raising issues that were appropriate, that were of genuine interest to the American people.\nAnd as more facts come out of this, as people take time to read the transcript of the President’s call and reflect on these facts, I think they’ll come to realize this is just more of the same of what we’ve seen from Democrats for the last two and a half years.\nThey’ve literally spent two and a half years pushing an impeachment of this administration and this President on a theory of Russian collusion and obstruction.  And when that didn’t pan out, they briefly tried to talk about impeaching Justice Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court.  And over the last 10 days, we’re back to talking impeachment.\nI think the people of America are saying enough is enough.  I mean, people of this country want us to focus on issues that matter most to them.  These endless investigations should end in Washington, D.C.  And Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats ought to be focusing on issues of security, of prosperity, of infrastructure, the USMCA, lowering drug prices, and whatever they want to fight about in Washington, D.C.  I promise you: President Trump and I are going to keep fighting for the issues that matter most for the American people.\nQ    What was your biggest takeaway from today’s meeting?  What was your biggest takeaway?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  My biggest takeaway is how proud the Hispanic American community is here in Arizona and in this country.  I mean, when you look at the growth and the prosperity that’s happened since 2016 in the state of Arizona, and you understand the role that Hispanic Americans have played in that, it was a real cause for celebration today.\nAnd we’re going to take this whole month — Hispanic Heritage Month — to talk about the incredible cultural contributions, community contributions, but economic contributions that Hispanic Americans make every day.\nMy big message was: As we see an economy that’s created 6.3 million new jobs, it’s been Hispanic Americans, Hispanic small businesses, Hispanic entrepreneurs that have been driving that economic renaissance.  And there was a lot of optimism in the room and a lot of appreciation for the policies that are really making this economy great again.\nQ    Is it appropriate, as the President did this morning and in a phone call with Ukraine, to ask foreign governments to investigate his political rival?\nQ    China, for example.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, let me say that, I’m Vice President of the United States, and I was elected to this job, along with President Trump for many reasons.  One was to re- — excuse me.  We were elected for many reasons.  One was to rebuild our military.  One was to revive our economy.  Another was to see conservatives appointed to our courts.  Another was to secure our borders.  But one of the main reasons we were elected to Washington, D.C. was to drain the swamp.\nAnd I think the American people have a right to know if the Vice President of the United States or his family profited from this position as Vice President during the last administration.  That’s about looking backwards and understanding what really happened.  I mean, the fact that my predecessor had a son who was paid $50,000 a month to be on a Ukrainian board at the time that Vice President Biden was leading the Obama administration’s efforts in Ukraine — I think is worth looking into.\nAnd the President made it very clear that he believes — he believes our other nations around the world should look into it as well.  I mean, the simple fact is that, you know, when you hold the second highest office in the land, it comes with unique responsibilities — not just to be above impropriety, but to be above the appearance of impropriety.  And clearly, in this case, there are legitimate questions that ought to be asked.  And we’re going to continue to ask them since the American people have a right to know whether or not the Vice President of the United States or his family profited from his position.\nI mean, you look at the video of Vice President Biden and you see there was clearly a quid pro quo.  He said, if a prosecutor was not fired — who, among other things, was investigating the company his son sat on the board of — that he was going to withhold a billion dollars.  Contrast that with the President’s — the transcript of the President’s phone call with President Zelensky where there was no quid pro quo.  There was no pressure.  And I think it’s why most Americans want to get answers about what — what was going on.  And to have Ukraine, particularly, as the President said, to get to the bottom of it.  And I think that’s what the American people would expect and anticipate.\nBut this administration is going to continue to advance the polices and the agenda we were elected to advance.  That includes draining the swamp, and that includes demanding that our allies operate honest government in an upright way as well.\nQ    Any indications that the administration is (inaudible) with Hispanic voters?\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, let me say, we’re going to be in and out of Arizona a lot, because we’ve got a winning message.  Hispanic Americans here in Arizona are winning under the policies of President Trump and the policies that Martha McSally supported and Governor Ducey has advanced in this state.  I mean, our economy is growing.  Our military is stronger than ever before.\nAnd let me also say that I think the values of this administration have stood for — of faith, and family, and the sanctity of life, and freedom — those are all values that are synonymous with the Hispanic American community.  So we’re going to come here, and we’re going to talk about the progress that we’ve made for security, for prosperity.  But we’re also going to speak about the values that Hispanic Americans cherish, that this President has championed.  And I know we’re going to bring home a great victory for Senator McSally and President Donald Trump in November of 2020.\nEND\n",

Jim Coston of First Baptist.  Thank you for the warm hospitality here at First Baptist Church.\nIt is great to be in Arizona.  I’ll be in Tucson a little bit later today.  But it’s a great privilege to be able to come here and to meet with so many leaders in the Hispanic Community here in Arizona and to have a conversation at the very outset of Hispanic Heritage Month.\nThank you all for coming.  This is an exciting time in the life of the economy of Arizona and the economy of this nation.\nBut, as I’ll reflect in a moment, it’s also a very exciting time for the Hispanic American community.  And we couldn’t be more proud of it.  Allow me to bring greetings from a great champion of Hispanic Americans and someone who’s been fighting for jobs and opportunity and security for the Hispanic community and every community, President Donald Trump.  We spoke this morning.  I told him that I was going to see all of you, and he wanted me to convey his regards.\nI’m also grateful to be joined today by two go- — counting three, actually — officials that I deeply respect: your great Governor, Doug Ducey, who was my friend since the time I was Governor of the state of Indiana.  Governor, thank you for being here.  Thank you for being —\nGOVERNOR DUCEY:  Thank you for being here.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  — your great leadership in Arizona, and also for being such a great champion of the Hispanic community here in this state.\nSenator Martha McSally is also a very dear friend, and we served together in the House of Representatives.  She is a tenacious advocate for our armed forces and for economic growth.  The policies that the President and I have been able to advance would not have been possible without Senator McSally’s strong, steadfast support during her tenure in the Congress and, now, her tenure in the United States Senate.  So, thank you very much, Martha, for being here.\nAnd also, Jovita Carranza, my great friend, the Treasurer of the United States is with us today.  We’ll hear from each of these officials.  But, Jovita, thank you so much for your great leadership —\nTREASURER CARRANZA:  Thank you for the invitation.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  — for many years across this country and in this administration as our Treasurer.\nIt’s Hispanic Heritage Month.  And it’s a time when, as a nation, we pause and we really celebrate the extraordinary contributions that Hispanic Americans have made to the life of this nation throughout our history.\nBut this is a particularly exciting time for Hispanic Americans, because thanks to the leadership of President Trump and our strong allies in the Congress — where we’ve cut taxes, rolled back regulation on businesses large and small; where we’ve been able to expand access to American energy — we’ve launched an energy renaissance; it’s contributing mightily to the economy of this state and this nation — our economy is booming.  6.3 million new jobs created since Election Day 2016.  We’ve seen the stock market setting one record after another.  That means real — real impacts for people’s pensions and 401(k)s.  And it makes a real difference for working families.\nBut also, the number of jobs that have been created, particularly in Hispanic American communities, is exciting.  I have to tell you, for us, unemployment today is at a 50-year low.  But it is now — for 17 straight months, it is the lowest unemployment ever recorded for Hispanic Americans.  And I can tell you personally, President Trump and I couldn’t be more proud of the entrepreneurship and ingenuity of the Hispanic American community here in Arizona and really, all over the country.\nI grabbed a few statistics on my way in: Unemployment in the Hispanic American community today is under 5 percent.  That’s 17 months in a row.  But it had only gone under 5 percent for a single month in the last 43 years of the history of this country.\nI mean, the opportunity that we’ve given every American to keep more of what you earned, for businesses to have more income, lower taxes, less red tape and regulations — it’s been — it’s been the Hispanic American community that has seized those opportunities in unique ways.  And since Election Day, actually 2.4 million jobs have been created in the Hispanic American community alone.\nAnd — and maybe, even more importantly, to some of you all here, more than a million Hispanic women have entered the workforce.  And, even the New York Times acknowledged — and this a quote — “Hispanic women have emerged as the biggest job market winners in [this] economy.”  And I know we’ve got some great leaders in the community who will celebrate that just as much as we do.  (Laughter.)\nIn fact, according to a survey by Bank of America, three-quarters of Hispanic-owned small businesses expect their revenue to growth over the next year.  And a majority of Hispanic-owned small businesses plan to hire more employees in the near future.\nSo, it’s an exciting time in our economy.\nAnd, as we begin Hispanic Heritage Month, it’s a particularly exciting time for jobs and opportunities for Hispanic Americans, not just in a growing state like Arizona, but really all across the country.  And I’m looking forward to talking with you today about how we can continue to build on that; how we can continue to create opportunities — not just for employment and economic growth, but how we can expand educational opportunities, how we can advance public safety and security in the Hispanic American community.  And I’m truly grateful that you all would come out and participate in this conversation.\nI’m going to turn it over to the Governor.  But let me say before the cameras slip away, that, as I said, standing alongside the President when we kicked off Hispanic Heritage Month last week: The contributions of Hispanic Americans to the life and the culture of this country are incalculable.  And I truly do believe that this community represents all that’s best about America — a belief in faith and freedom and hard work and the American Dream.\nAnd I just want to commit to each and every one of you that President Trump and I are going to continue to fight for the opportunities of Hispanic Americans and every American to live the American Dream.  And I thank you so much for coming out today.  Okay?  Thank you.\nAnd, Governor Ducey, thank you for being here and we look forward to your remarks as well.\nGOVERNOR DUCEY:  Thank you.  I want to say thank you to the Vice President for choosing Arizona to come out and highlight Hispanic Heritage Month.  I’m very grateful for your leadership and for your friendship — our service together in the Governor’s Conference, and the real work that you and President Trump are doing on behalf of our economy and growth in our nation.  And I’m happy that we can highlight it here today.\nWe’ve got a great group of Hispanic leaders, decision-makers, and influencers here who are going to share with us what’s happening in the community — ideas that we can bring back to the state house and to the federal government to further improve our economy.\nBut you are right, Mr. Vice President: Our economy is booming in the state of Arizona.  We’ve added 300,000 new jobs in our state alone since 2015.  Arizona can brag as one of the fastest-growing states in the nation.  Maricopa County is the fastest-growing county in the country.  This is three years running.  And Phoenix was just named the fastest-growing city in the country.  So this is not on any small basis.  This is 4.8 million people.  This is larger than 26 other American states.\nSo we want to take advantage of this and reaffirm our commitment to the Hispanic community because it has been their involvement and contribution that has been such a driver in this success.  Their relentless work ethic, their unwavering belief in our American Dream — this community has been integral to what’s happening in our state.\nI think Arizona is a reflection of this.  The art, the literature, the music, and the food reflect the values of this community and the flourishing business community brings it to life every day.  The contributions of the Hispanic community is something for everyone in Arizona to be proud of and to celebrate.\nAnd, with 2019, came a very special milestone: the 60th anniversary of the Arizona-Mexico Commission, something that was founded by Governor Paul Fannin, who said, Mexico is our neighbor — “God made us neighbors, let us be good neighbors.”  And it’s something we’re very proud of.  Our relationship today is as good as it has ever been.\nSo I’m immensely proud of the hard work, dedication, and collaboration that it’s take — taken for six decades of the Arizona-Mexico Commission.  And with an economy that continues to boom, it comes as no surprise that the Hispanic community in our state and nation continues to grow.\nJust a couple, I think, key stats: In 2017, Latinos accounted for nearly one-quarter of entrepreneurs in the United States, despite being just 18 percent of the population.  It shows the innovation that is so natural in this community.  From 2000 to 2017, Arizona’s Hispanic population grew 42 percent.  Today, it’s over 2.2 million people.  And by 2022, Hispanic buying power in Arizona will surpass $57 billion.\nSo I want to thank you all for your commitment to Arizona and opening up opportunity in the Southwest.  Arizona remains committed to working with our Hispanic community to accomplish these things that matter.  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Great job.  Great job, Governor.\nGOVERNOR DUCEY:  Thank you.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Senator?\nSENATOR MCSALLY:  Mr. Vice President, welcome back to Arizona.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\nSENATOR MCSALLY:  It’s great to have you here and it’s great to be with Governor Ducey and our leaders here representing the Hispanic community as we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month.\nIt’s an absolute honor to represent the great state of Arizona in the United States Senate.  And we are a very diverse state.  And I have been spending my whole life fighting stereotypes — you know, making generalizations about, you know, groups of people — but the numbers certainly speak for themselves.\nWith the environment that we’ve been able to create — with the policies, and rolling back regulations, and cutting taxes on small businesses — we now see Hispanic-owned businesses growing at an incredible rate.  You know, between 2012 and 2018, Hispanic entrepreneurs and Hispanic-owned businesses grew by 40 percent across the country, while other businesses were growing at more like 18 to 20 percent.\nAnd I’m particularly proud to see the growing number of female Hispanic entrepreneurs.  You are the job creators.  You are the ones that are getting up every day and making such a difference.  The men are as well, but the growing number of female Hispanic-owned businesses is just incredible —\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  It’s amazing.\nSENATOR MCSALLY:  — across the country and across our state.\nWe now — our population in Arizona is about 30 percent Hispanic and it’s going to continue to grow.\nSo, you are making such a difference and it’s an honor to be able to partner with all of you.  And I really look forward to hearing your feedback today as we continue to work together to provide more opportunities for everybody, especially for Hispanic Arizonans.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you so much, Senator.  Yeah.\nSENATOR MCSALLY:  Yes, sir.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  And thanks for all your great support that —\nSENATOR MCSALLY:  Absolutely.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  — that agenda.\nAnd I want to recognize the Treasurer of the United States.  She’s going to be traveling with me and with the Senator and the Governor down to Tucso- — Tucson, because we’re talking about the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.  Because, for all the momentum that we have in this economy, President Trump and I are absolutely determined to call on this Congress to bring the USMCA to the floor and bring it to the floor this year.  We believe it is a win for Arizona, it’s a win for America, and we’re going to be taking the case for the USMCA to Tucson a little bit later today.\nAnd I’m personally grateful to have the Treasurer of the United States with us to help make that case.\nTREASURER CARRANZA:  Thank you.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  So, Jovita Carranza, thank you so much for your leadership, but thank you being here today and helping us support an agenda that’s going to put even more momentum in this economy and more momentum in the Hispanic American community.\nTREASURER CARRANZA:  Well, I’d like to share with the group, and especially with you, Vice President Pence, and the Governor, for all the fine work that you’re doing and the leadership that the Senator is providing.\nYou know, I’m bringing it back home — you have about 6,000 SMEs that — in Arizona — that have provided about 20 billion dollars’ worth of export, which is a phenomenal number, and about $1.7 million — billion of that is in agriculture.\nBut you’re real strong sector is the IT sector, as well as — and when I say “IT,” it’s computers and electronics.  And the other is transportation — that of heavy equipment.  I believe we’re going to visit that in Tucson.\nSo, all that spells to one word — two words: job-growth prosperity.  And so the more opportunities we have with the USMCA trade agreement — which is very beneficial, especially for low exports — low-revenue exports or value exports — less regulations and greater facilitation for trade.\nAnd any time we facilitate any type of commerce, it means job growth — immediate job growth, efficiencies for the private sector.  And all that results into greater benefit strengths for the workforce, as you know.\nThe other point I wanted to make is that SMEs in Arizona — over 550,000 of them — represent 94 — I should say about 99.4 percent of your businesses, which is pretty — pretty strength — pretty strong.  And that represents about 45 percent of the workforce in Arizona.  So you have a great state.  A lot of potential here for prosperity.\nAnd I have to reflect on one other number.  The Hispanic community used to be the lowest number in any kind of reporting, and now it is the thriving number —\nGOVERNOR DUCEY:  Right.\nTREASURER CARRANZA:  — and every principal in the government has been touting the growth in the Latina entrepreneurship sector, as well as high school graduation numbers are progressing.  Even school debt is — been lower.  And poverty levels in the Hispanic community has improved significantly.\nSo, we’re driving some of these very strong numbers of prosperity in the United States, based on what the President has provided as retooling this economy for all Americans to prosper.  So I thank you very much for this opportunity to share.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Jovita.  Thank you for your great service to the country and we’re looking very much forward to a conversation with each one of you about how we continue to build on that momentum.\nBut I can tell you the — I don’t think the President or I ever miss an opportunity to brag on the incredible progress in the Hispanic American community.  Lowest unemployment ever recorded for Hispanic Americans — now 17 months in a row, below 5 percent.  It is a tribute to communities like you all represent here — states like Arizona.\nAnd I just want to — I just want to promise each and every one of you: We’re going to continue to fight for those opportunities.  Because that businessman who became President looks at all of that progress — 6.3 million new jobs, record unemployment, 50-year low for every American — and he just calls that a good start.  (Laughter.)\nAnd so, Senator, get ready.  We’re going to keep going to create even better economic conditions and better opportunities.  And really — and really do so in a way that will continue to see this Hispanic American community thrive, Arizona thrive.  And I thank you all for being here for the conversation.\nThank you all.\nEND\n",

        "text": "South Lawn10:17 A.M. EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.  We’re going to The Villages in Ocala, Florida.  We have a big crowd.  We’re going to be talking about healthcare.  We’re doing a lot of work on healthcare.  We’re very successful at it.  And so we’re going to be speaking to the great people of Florida.  And I think they’re very happy with the job we’re doing.\nYeah.\nQ    Mr. President, first question, what did you —\nQ    What exactly, specifically, is inaccurate in the whistleblower’s complaint?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  What?\nQ    What exactly is inaccurate in the whistleblower’s complaint?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, if you look at the whistleblower’s complaint, it’s totally inaccurate because the conversation that I had was absolutely perfect.  And most people that have read it say the same thing.  The whistleblower never saw the — saw the conversation.  He got his information, I guess, second- or third-hand.  He wrote something that was total fiction.  And now, when people see that, they’re not happy.\nQ    Do you want to restrict investment flows into China and have Chinese stocks delisted?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re looking at a lot of different things.  China is coming in next week.  We’re going to have a meeting with them.  We’ll see.  But we’re doing very well.\nSome of the numbers, I think, are being affected by all of the nonsense, all of the politics going on in this country by the Democrats.  I call them the “Do-nothings.”  They do nothing for this country.  They don’t care about this country.  But the numbers, really, are looking very good, going into the future.\nSo, we’ll see.  I have a lot of options on China.  But if they don’t do what we want, we have tremendous — tremendous power.\nQ    Mr. President, what exactly did you hope Zelensky would do about the Bidens after your phone call?  Exactly.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I would think that, if they were honest about it, they’d start a major investigation into the Bidens.  It’s a very simple answer.\nThey should investigate the Bidens, because how does a company that’s newly formed — and all these companies, if you look at —\nAnd, by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with — with Ukraine.\nSo, I would say that President Zelensky — if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens.  Because nobody has any doubt that they weren’t crooked.  That was a crooked deal — 100 percent.  He had no knowledge of energy; didn’t know the first thing about it.  All of a sudden, he is getting $50,000 a month, plus a lot of other things.  Nobody has any doubt.\nAnd they got rid of a prosecutor who was a very tough prosecutor.  They got rid of him.  Now they’re trying to make it the opposite way.  But they got rid —\nSo, if I were the President, I would certainly recommend that of Ukraine.\nQ    Have you asked President Xi to investigate at all?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I haven’t, but it’s certainly something we can start thinking about.  Because I’m sure that President Xi does not like being under that kind of scrutiny, where billions of dollars is taken out his country by a guy that just got kicked out of the Navy.  He got kicked out of the Navy; all of a sudden, he’s getting billions of dollars.  You know what they call that?  They call that a “payoff.”\nQ    In your view, Mr. President — in your view, should the White House comply with any congressional subpoenas associated with the whistleblower complaint?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I leave that to the lawyers.  I can say, though, that Schiff has now been proven to be a liar.  We’ve known it for three years, because they’ve been trying to impeach for three years.  He’s a li- — he’s a stone-cold liar.  So I leave that to the lawyers.  That’s up to them to decide.  But the whole investigation is crumbling.\nYeah.\nQ    Can you still work with Congress to get other work done?  Can you still work with Congress?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I can.  Yeah, I can.\nQ    How can you do that?  How?\nQ    (Inaudible.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You got — I —\nQ    Mr. President, Pakistan is urging (inaudible) talks with the Taliban.  Are you going to do that?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we have a real problem.  We’ve been hitting the Taliban very, very hard.  And, as far as I’m concerned, they still haven’t recovered from killing 12 people — one of — happened to be a great American solider from Puerto Rico.  They still have not recovered, and they probably never will.\nQ    Mr. President — President Trump, what is McConnell — what is McConnell telling you about impeachment?  Has he assured you that Senate Republicans won’t vote for it?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  No, but I read Mitch McConnell’s statement yesterday, and he read my phone call.  And, as you know, he put out a statement that said that was the most innocent phone call he’s read.  And I spoke to him about it, too.\nHe read my phone call with the President of Ukraine.  Mitch McConnell — he said, “That was the most innocent phone call that I’ve read.”  I mean, give me a break.  Anybody that reads it says the same thing.  And the only people that don’t understand it is when they look at the false, fabricated, fraudulent statement made by Shifty Schiff.\nQ    Mr. President, Vice President Biden — Vice President Biden said that he’s not going anywhere.  He has said that you’re not going to destroy his family.  What do — what’s your response?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think Biden is going down.  And I think his whole situation — because now you may very well find that there are many other countries that they scammed, just like they scammed China and Ukraine.  And basically, who are they really scamming?  The USA.  And it’s not good.\nQ    He said he was carrying out the official policy —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And that’s probably why China, for so many years, has had a sweetheart deal where China rips off the USA — because they deal like people with Biden, where they give their son a billion and a half dollars.  And that’s probably why China has such a sweetheart deal that, for so many years, they’ve been ripping off our country.\nQ    Do you support SB-206 — the college athletes getting paid?  Or do you side with the NCAA and the schools?   And do you think this should be a federal law?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’re looking at it.  We’re looking at very closely.  It’s under study.\nQ    Has North Korea gone too far this time with the ballistic missile?  Is that too far?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  We’ll see.  They want to talk, and we’ll be talking to them soon.  We’ll see.\nSo I’m going to — yes?\nQ    Mr. President, why did recall the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine?  Was she a problem?  Why did you recall her?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I heard very bad things about her.  And I don’t know if I recalled her or somebody recalled her, but I heard very, very bad things about her for a long period of time.  Not good.\nThank you.  I’ll see you in Florida.  I’ll see you all in Florida.\nEND\n10:24 A.M.

        "text": "East Room2:25 P.M. EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.   Thank you.  Look at all the press that you attract.  Do you believe this?  That’s very impressive.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  I guess they are not after me.  (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I hope not.  You’re lucky.\nThank you very much.  Today, it’s my honor to welcome President Niinistö of Finland to the White House.   And, Mr. President, it’s wonderful to host you once again in Washington.  We’ve gotten to know each other over the last period of time, and it’s been — it’s been a great experience.\nThe President and I have just concluded very productive discussions on a number of exciting opportunities for our two nations.\nBefore going further, I want to express our deep condolences over the horrific stabbing attack that took place yesterday at a college in Finland.  America is praying for the victims and their families, and we send our unwavering love and support.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  The American and Finnish people are linked by an abiding commitment to self-government, individual rights, democracy, and the rule of law.  This past May, our countries celebrated the 100th anniversary of America’s recognition of the independent nation of Finland in 1919.  As President Wilson wrote at the time, our recognition was “prompted by [the] sympathies for a cause similar to that which caused our own declaration of independence in 1776.”\nA century after we established diplomatic relations, the United States and Finland remain united by those same cherished values.\nCentral to this effort is our nations’ close cooperation on matters of security and defense.  Although Finland is not a member of NATO — you save a lot of money — Finland participates in many NATO missions and exercises.  And I’m pleased that Finland is substantially increasing its military budget.\nAmerica and Finland are also working together to advance stability, freedom of navigation, and respect for national sovereignty in the Arctic.  Both of our nations are committed to a secure Arctic region — free from external intrusion, interference, and coercion.  Simply put, we believe that the affairs of the Arctic should be governed by the actual nations of the Arctic.  And, as you know, there are other people coming into the Arctic, and we don’t like it.  And we can’t let it happen, and we won’t let it happen.\nThe United States and Finland are likewise partnering to ensure the security of 5G networks.  It is critical that we use safe and trustworthy technology providers, components, and supply chains.  We welcome the establishment of the UROS Innovation Center in Finland.  Qualcomm has done a fantastic job with that.  This Innovation Center will greatly expand American and Finnish businesses and cooperation in 5G.\nWe’re also glad that the Finnish company, Nokia — it’s a great company — a global leader in 5G technology, is developing its cutting-edge products right here in the United States at Bell Labs in New Jersey.\nAcross the United States, foreign direct investment from Finland totals over $10 billion.  Each year, Finnish-owned companies invest more than $120 million in research and development in America, and expand our exports by more than $1 billion.\nJust today, Finnish Nokian Tyres opened a new manufacturing plant in Dayton, Tennessee — a $360 million investment that is creating hundreds of brand new, beautiful jobs for a great state: Tennessee.  We love Tennessee.  So, they made a wise choice.  You never lose when you go to Tennessee.\nI encourage other Finnish companies to increase their investments in the United States.  There has simply never been a better time to do business in America.  We have passed the largest tax cuts and reform, and also regulation cuts, in the history of country.  We slashed business tax.  And we’re fueling job growth through our record-setting campaign to abolish all of those really terrible, unnecessary regulations.  We have plenty of regulations, but many of them we didn’t need, and we got rid of them.\nThe American economy is booming, wages are rising, incomes are soaring, and unemployment has hit its lowest level in more than half a century.  We want Finnish companies to join in America’s extraordinary economic revival.  So many countries are coming in.  It’s the hot place.  We have the hottest economy in the world, and it’s the hot place to be.  They all want to be here.\nThe President and I are also working on a way to improve international trade based on the principle of fairness and — my favorite word — reciprocity.  I hope that Finland, which now holds the rotating presidency of the EU Council, will support our efforts to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement with the European Union.  We’re going to have to start doing something with the European Union because they have not been treating this country right for many, many years.  And they know it.  And I tell them, and they know it.\nAmerica’s trade deficit with the EU has been averaging $160 billion a year for many, many years.   Achieving more balanced and robust trade flows would greatly benefit both Finland and the United States.  We also appreciate Finland’s strong partnership in combatting predatory trade practices worldwide, including the theft of intellectual property.\nFrom trade to security, from travel to commerce, we are immensely grateful for our close and deeply valued friendship with the people of Finland.  Great people.  And we’re now working on a deal to sell a large number of airplanes, fighter jets — hopefully to Finland.  We’ll see how that works out.  But we make the greatest jets in the world.  We make the greatest missiles and military equipment anywhere in the world.  Nobody is even close.\nMr. President, I want to thank you again for visiting the White House.  The history of our two nations is a profound testament to the importance of our independence and resolve to defend it.  I look forward to continuing to work alongside of you as we safeguard our precious sovereignty and build a bright future of hope, harmony, and peace for the American and Finnish people.\nAnd thank you very much for being with us at the White House and the Oval Office.  We had a very special number of hours.  Appreciate it very much.  Thank you, sir.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  Thank you, Mr. President.  First of all, I will deliver your condolences to —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Please.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  — Finnish people.  They do appreciate that.  Thank you.\nLadies and gentlemen, before meeting, I had some spare time, so I visited a couple of museums here — Museum of American History, Museum of American African History, and Museum of American Indian History.  And in addition to that, I had a possibility of attending ceremony in Arlington.\nMr. President, you have here a great democracy.  Keep it going on.  We were — we had a very good discussion with the President.  Like you mentioned, our diplomatic relations are 100 years old.  During that time, we have developed our cooperation a lot, not only in official meetings like this, but American and Finnish people, scientists, for example, need each other cooperating, working together.\nWe have quite a lot of cooperation in security sector, also in defense, because I think that we share the feeling that the most important thing for the nation is to guarantee security to its citizens.  And that is the starting point for Finland, also, to this cooperation.\nI wanted to take up with the President the importance of transatlantic cooperation.  Well, we all know Europe needs USA.  But I say that USA needs also Europe.  We know the price of everything.  We should recognize also the value of everything.  We share the same values: democracy, human rights, rule-based order.  And in that, we are very similar.\nEurope has, in a way, awakened during the couple last years to understand also more about security point of view.  And I just want to tell you that, in my opinion, the stronger Europe you have, the stronger partner you have.\nThe Arctic area — you know Finland is in very north — is becoming more and more interesting, like the President said.  We both, alongside with six countries, form the Arctic Council.  And we are working heavily.  There are, surely, possibilities.  Like we have heard, the maritime routes are being opened.  Maybe there are also resources, but there are huge risks.  One of them is that we should keep the low tension we are used to have there.  And that is what we have been discussing, and I do appreciate President’s position to emphasize that.  It is not a place for military.\nBut an even greater challenge is the environment, and I’m very glad that we started to talk two years ago in this very house about black coal.  It is not, maybe, the worst which causes climate problems, but it is — everybody can understand that if black comes down to ice and to snow, when the sun meets it, it melts down.  And melting of sea ice in Arctic is very crucial.  I used to say that if we lose the Arctic, we lose the globe.\nWe had a couple of words — very important ones – on arms control.  We — some of us remember the worst years of Cold War in 1960s.  There was no agreement at all.  Just Cold War.  We can’t let the situation return no agreement at all about arms control.  And that is why it is important to try to negotiate new agreements and to continue the New START Agreement.  That will be a good new start for international cooperation on that.\nTo end up with — you, Mr. President, referred to 5G, the EU use of ICT as a whole.  We are very proud to have the excellence of — the Centre of Excellence of Hybrid in Helsinki.  The USA has been very helpful in that.  Very many countries are working there together to fight against the future danger of hybrid warfare.\nWhen comes to providers in that area, I am not very willing to point out any country or company here now.  It may be a bit late from USA, in EU, making a risk assessment.  It will be prepared in one, two weeks’ time.  And after that, we are in a place that we have to choose the tools to protect us.\nMr. President, I want to thank you very much for having a possibility of meeting you here.  It is very valuable, and I found our discussions very open, very interesting, and giving a lot to my little country.  Thank you, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.\nBefore we take questions, something happened that’s been — it’s been going on for many decades and we came to a conclusion.  Could I ask Ambassador Pence to just come up for one second and explain the importance of what just took place?  Because this has been going on for —\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  Wonderful.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  — many, many years.  And this is Ambassador Pence.  No relationship to our great Vice President.  Hard to believe.  Nobody believes that, but that’s true.  (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  (Inaudible) one.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Right?\nAMBASSADOR PENCE:  But I have been introduced as his father, his brother, his cousin, and his uncle.  (Laughter.)  We are friends.\nGood afternoon.  When I arrived in Helsinki about a year and a half ago, there were stack of papers on the desk, one of a couple of which concerned indigenous peoples from the southwestern United States — Arizona, Colorado — including probably most predominantly, but generically I will refer to them as Hopi Indians.  They were one of the group.  In 1895, a lot of their remains had been excavated and removed along with about 500 artifacts to Finland.  And there they’ve remained despite a lot of activity to get them back.\nAnd I’ll just jump to the end and say: Through the good offices of our State Department, but in particular, President Niinistö and his entire team, we’ve secured a mutual agreement whereby all of those remains, including a number of petrified bodies, will be going back to be put back where they were buried.\nSo it’s special to us, and I think it’s probably special to indigenous peoples everywhere around the globe that we’re all concerned about paying appropriate respect to those who have departed before us.  So, thank you.  Thank you both of the Presidents for supporting this.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.  Fantastic job.  Thank you.  Be careful.\nThank you.  That’s a great job, Mr. Ambassador.  That’s been going on for many, many decades.  So, I just want to thank you.  Outstanding.\nJohn Roberts?\nQ    Mr. President, thank you.  President Niinistö.  If I could, sir, I’ve got two pertinent questions to ask you.  Maybe I could ask them separately to get a fresh answer out of each one.\nThe three House Intelligence — the three House committees that are looking into the impeachment inquiry gave notice today that they will be sending a subpoena to the White House for documents and other materials.  Will you cooperate with those subpoenas?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I always cooperate.  This is a hoax.  This is the greatest hoax.  This is just a continuation of what’s been playing out, John, for the last — since my election, I would say.  If you wanted — probably, we’ll find out soon, but probably even before my election.\nThis is a fraudulent crime on the American people.  But we’ll work together with Shifty Schifft [sic] and Pelosi and all of them, and we’ll see what happens, because we did absolutely — I had a great call with the President of Ukraine.  It was 100 percent.  You have the transcript.\nAnd then, Schiff went up and he got — as the chairman of the committee, he got up and related a call that didn’t take place.  He made up the language.  Hard to believe.  Nobody has ever seen this.  I think he had some kind of a mental breakdown.\nBut he went up to the microphone and he read a statement from the President of the United States as if I were on the call, because what happened is, when he looked at the sheet — which was an exact transcript of my call, done by very talented people that do this — exact, word for word — he said, “Wow, he didn’t do anything wrong.”  So he made it up.  He went up to a microphone, and, in front of the American people and in Congress, he went out and he gave a whole presentation of words that the President of the United States never said.  It has to be a criminal act.  It has to be.  And he should resign.  And some people even say it was treason.  But it was a very sad thing.\nAnd just so you know, the call was perfect — the real call; the call I made.  Many people were on the line.  I knew that because, usually, when I speak to foreign country leaders — you can name any one of them — but when I speak on the phone, I know that we have many people listening from various intelligence agencies.  My knowledge — I know all about it.  And so this isn’t something like, “Oh, gee, I’m on the line.  Let’s talk about a big secret.”  This is many people on the line.  I don’t even know how many.  We’ll find out, I guess.  But many people.  Mike Pompeo was on the line.  He didn’t say anything.  He just — because they listen for both knowledge and for security reasons and for lots of reasons.\nBut the President of Ukraine, at the United Nations the other day — and previous to that — he announced through his spokesperson — said there was absolutely no pressure put on him.  There was no quid pro quo, at all.  And if you look at this whistleblower’s — which I have a lot of respect for whistleblowers, but only when they’re real — his report of the phone call was totally different than the fact.\nBut what got them was they never thought I was going to release the call.  Because I don’t like doing that.  I don’t want to do it.  I hope I don’t have to do it again — release phone calls to foreign dignitaries, to foreign leaders.  I don’t want to do that, John.  I don’t want to do it again.  But I did it with the permission of the Ukrainian government.  We got permission.  We called up their representatives and asked them, “Would it be okay?”  Otherwise, I couldn’t have done it.\nAnd if I wouldn’t have done it, I would have been exposed to a lie, because the whistleblower report — didn’t he say, seven or eight times, I said “quid pro quo”?  In other words, “You’re going to do this or you’re not going to get money.”\nNow, in all fairness — Biden said it, and he’s on tape.  In all fairness, you have at least four United States senators — Democrats — that said it.  And they said it a lot stronger than even Schiff and his made-up story said it.\nObama, when he was dealing with the President of Russia — not Putin — he said, “Hey, tell Vladimir I can do a lot more after the election.”  You remember that?  You didn’t make a big deal out of that.  Everybody thought, “Oh, isn’t that cute?  Isn’t that cute?”  My talk and my response — Lindsey Graham said, “I never knew you were that nice.  I can’t believe you were that nice.”  He said that loud and clear.  It was perfect.  It was perfect.  Not a thing wrong with it.\nTo impeach a President over a fraud that was committed by other people that want to win an election in 2020 — which they won’t — is incredible.  This is the greatest hoax.  Now, it’s gone on for a long time.  We had the Mueller collusion delusion, okay?  That went on for years.  And that’s finally done.  No collusion, no obstruction, no nothing.  It was a joke, and everyone knows it.  And it was from the day one.  Now I get three days of peace, and I’m walking into the United Nations, going to meet with the biggest leaders in the world, and I hear about the word “impeachment.”  I said, “What did I do now?”  And it was about a beautiful conversation that I had.\nAnd just remember this: The Ukrainian new President, a fine man, said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.  There was no pressure.”  And he said it a number of times.\nOkay, what’s your second question?  Well, you shouldn’t be asking two questions.\nQ    Well, you’re going to want to answer them.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Do me a favor: Ask one of the Finnish —\nQ    I will.  But I think you’ll want —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  John.  John.\nQ    I think you’ll want to ask — answer this question, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  John, ask one of the Finnish President.\nQ    And then can I come back to you?  Because I think you’ll want to answer this.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  We’ll talk later.  Sure.  Well, it sounds like it might be a good question.  Let me see if I like the question.  Go ahead.  (Laughter.)  Maybe for the first time in three years, I’ll have a good question, and I’ll love it.\nQ    There is a report that came out just before you and President Niinistö walked out here that the whistleblower met with a staff member of Adam Schiff, prior to —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Oh, I love that question.\nQ    — the complaint being filed.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  It shows that Schiff is a fraud.\nQ    And I —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I love that question.  Thank you, John.\nQ    So can I finish asking it?  (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes.  There’s nothing to finish.\nQ    So the whistleblower, according to this report, met with a member of staff — of Adam Schiff’s staff.  You’ve got it right there.  You know it.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I hate to say it’s the New York Times.  I can’t believe they wrote it.\nQ    Your response to the fact that —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Maybe they’re getting better.\nQ    Your response to the fact that that happened and that Schiff may have learned some of what the whistleblower knew prior to the complaint being filed?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think it’s a scandal that he knew before.  I’d go a step further: I think he’s probably helped write it.  Okay?  That’s what the word is.  And I think it’s — I give a lot of respect for the New York Times for putting it out.\nIt just happened.  As I’m walking up here, they handed it to me.  And I said to Mike — I said, “Whoa, that’s something.  That’s big stuff.”  That’s a big story.  He knew long before, and he helped write it, too.  It’s a scam.  It’s a scam.\nJust to finish on this — I appreciate it.  I love that second question, by the way.  Should have asked it first.  (Laughter.)  But — but, let me just tell you: The whole thing is a scam.  The Mueller deal was a scam.  The Russian collusion was a scam.  You can ask Putin.  Nobody has been rougher on Russia than Donald Trump, okay?\nNow, with that being said, it would be great to get along with Russia.  And we will get along with Russia, because it’s smart.  But nobody has been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump.\nOkay.  Ask one, please.\nQ    Yes.  President Niinistö, good to see you again.  You had a conversation with President Trump about 5G, and how Nokia, Finland’s big company, could fill in that space.  You also met with Chinese President Xi during the summer, in which you renewed the ties of friendship between the two nations.  Do you believe that countries, particularly western countries, that put Huawei equipment in their 5G cores are at risk of national security?\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  Thank you.  Like I told you already: In Europe, the situation is maybe a bit different from that here, because the main company you mentioned is inside Europe — partly, at least.\nWhat European Union is now doing is making a risk assessment, asking each country what kind of experience, what kind of — what you have seen and found out.  And that will be well-finished in week two — or two weeks’ time.  And after that, we have to decide together, in European Union, which kind of tools we need to protect ourselves.\nYou referred to my discussions with President Xi.  We didn’t talk about 5G while meeting.  And we all know Nokia is a major factor in this area.  They will answer for themselves.  Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, please.  Pick somebody who is really nice from Finland.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  No more Finnish —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Do you have a really nice person?\nQ    — Finnish —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think they’re all nice in Finland.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  Are there Finnish reporters?  Just two.  Okay.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Uh oh.\nQ    Hi.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  Did I — wait a minute.  Yes?\nQ    I’m Mari Karppinen from MTV News Finland and I have one question for President Trump and one question for President Niinistö.  First, Mr. Trump, how will this political storm affect U.S. foreign policy, especially its relationship with Finland?\nAnd second, for President Niinistö — because this is the biggest issue here at the moment, I have to ask: What kind of favors has Mr. Trump asked from you?  (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Or the other way around, you mean?\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  What favors I asked or was asked?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think you mean the other way around.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  Both ways.  Okay.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  So the political storm — I’ve lived with it from the day I got elected.  I’ve done more — and this administration has done more than any administration in the history of this country in the first two and a half years.  I’m used to it.  For me, it’s like putting on a suit in the morning.\nPeople have said to me, “How does he handle it?”  Rush Limbaugh said, “I don’t know of any man in America that could handle it.”  Sean Hannity said the same thing.  Others have said the same thing, “I don’t know any man in America…”  Because it’s all a fraud.\nAnd because of that, and because I know that I’m right, and because I’m doing a great job for the American people, I’m very, very happy living the way I’m living.  I thought that I would finish off the first term without the threat of people making false claims, but this one turned out to be incredible.  All because they didn’t know that I had a transcript done by very, very talented people — word for word, comma for comma.  Done by people that do it for a living.  We had an exact transcript.  And when we produced that transcript, they died.  Because you look at the whistleblower statement, and it’s vicious.  Vicious.  And that whistleblower, there’s no question in my mind that some bad things have gone on, and I think we’ll get to the bottom of it.  I think it’s going to be a total reversal.\nBut I’ve lived with this.  I’ve lived with this cloud now for almost three years — more than that, because it probably started even before.  And I think nobody has done what I’ve done when you look at tax cuts and regulation cuts, and rebuilding our military, and Right to Try.  Right to Try.  That means people that are terminally ill and very sick have the right to use our medicines — our great medicines — because we’re so far ahead of every other country.\nSo many things that we’ve done.  Our vets are now taking care of.  We’ve got Choice.  Nobody thought we could ever get Choice.  That’s when you have to wait on line as a vet.  You go outside, you get a doctor, we pay the bill.  You don’t have to wait for three weeks to see a doctor if you’re a vet.  We cherish our vets — at least this administration does.  But for many years, they didn’t.  But I take care of the vets.\nNo administration has done — and I’ve lived with it from the day I got elected, so I’m just fine with it.  Okay?\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  Yes.  We had a conversation and discussion on a very equal basis, which is, I really appreciate that.\nWell, I had one request specifically.  I wanted the President to take more notice on transatlantic relations because I consider it’s useful both for USA and Europe.\nWhile we were discussing also trading, I told the President that the big purchase we are doing on fighters will be finished in two years’ time.  We have five different candidates: three from Europe and two from United States.  He answered that, “Ours is best.”  (Laughs.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Jeff, go ahead.\nQ    Thank you, sir.  Jeff Mason from Reuters.  Mr. President, I’d like to ask you about your use of the word “treason.”  You used it repeatedly in the last few days.  Do you consider anyone who opposes you treasonous?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  No.  No.  I consider when they lie; when they stand before our great body in our great chamber, and they make up a story that’s fiction, like Schiff did.  He took that perfect conversation I had with the Ukrainian President, and he made it into a total lie.  It was a total fabrication.  And you do admit that.  It was a total fabrication.\nHe said, “This is what…” — and the only ones that don’t like my conversation are the ones that never read it.  But they heard Shifty Schiff.  That’s what I call a lie.  And because of the fact that he’s — he’s lying about the President of the United States and as to what the President says — you know, I — believe it or not, I watch my words very carefully.  There are those that think I’m a very stable genius.  Okay?  I watch my words very, very closely.  And to have somebody get up and to totally fabricate a conversation that I had with another leader and make it sound so bad — it was so evil.  And now I see this that just came out minutes ago, where he met at a time that was impossible to have done unless there’s corruption involved.\nAnd just so you know, we’ve been investigating, on a personal basis — through Rudy and others, lawyers — corruption in the 2016 election.  We’ve been investigating corruption, because I probably will — I was going to definitely — but I probably will be bringing a lot of litigation against a lot of people having to do with the corrupt investigation, having to do with the 2016 election.\nQ    For example?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And I have every right to do that.  Because the way they’ve treated me and other people — they’ve destroyed people.  They’ve destroyed their lives with a phony charge that never existed.  And that was collusion.  Never existed.  And you had 18 people that hated Donald Trump.  And you had Bob Mueller that hated Donald Trump.  And in the end, they couldn’t find one damn thing.  I could find it on you.  They couldn’t find one thing about Donald Trump having to do with collusion.  This is after two years and spending $42 million.\nAnd I’ve been looking at that long and hard for a long period of time — how it started, why it started.  It should never happen to another President ever.  But I’ve been talking about it from the standpoint of bringing a major lawsuit, and I’ve been talking about it for a long time.\nWe’ve been investigating the corruption, having to do with what they did to my people.  They destroyed many of peop- — many people.  They came down to Washington to do a great job, and they left home.  They left Washington dark.  They were dark.  They came down here, I say, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.  They wanted to do a great job for the people.  They wanted to do a great job.  We won the election.  And then, they get served with subpoenas.  All these subpoenas.\nNow, look at Nancy Pelosi.  Nancy Pelosi hands out subpoenas like — you know, she has to approve it.  She hands out subpoenas like they’re cookies.  “You want a subpoena?  Here you go.  Take them.”  Like they’re cookies.  Paul Ryan would never give anybody a subpoena.  He wouldn’t give them when Mark Meadows went in to talk.  He wouldn’t give them when Jim Jordan went in.  When Devin Nunes — he would go in, and they’d see Paul.  I’m not saying wrong or right, but Paul Ryan: “No, let’s talk about it.  That’s a big thing, to give a subpoena.  Let’s talk about it.”  Two weeks later, they’re still talking.  They wanted subpoenas to investigate the corrupt Democrats and the corrupt people on the other side.  Paul Ryan would not give subpoenas.\nNancy Pelosi?  “Here you go.  Take it.  Who wants a subpoena?”  Every day, you get subpoenas.  And Paul Ryan was actually right, probably, because they should never, ever allow a thing like this to happen to our country again.\nThank you very much.  Please.\nQ    Mr. President, can you just make clear, right here: What do you or what did you want President Zelensky to do with regard to Joe and Hunter Biden?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  If you look at what he said — okay?  And he brought it up.  I think he brought up the name, “Rudy Giuliani.”  What I want is the following: And I’ve said this loud and clear.  We have our ambassadors here.  We have Mike Pence here.  Why are we the only ones that give the big money to the Ukraine?\nWe give money to Ukraine, and it’s bothered me from day one.  And you have plenty of people — just here.  I say, “How come it’s always the United States that gets ripped?”  Frankly, Ukraine — we want to help them.  And I do like the new President.  You know why I like him?  Because he was honest, because he said, “There was no pressure at all exerted on me” — meaning him — “by the President of the United States.”  He said it.  By the way, that one sentence should stop this.  But he said there was no pressure exerted.\nBut you don’t have to ask him; all you have to do is read the transcript.  Read the telephone call.\nBut what I was having a problem with are two things.  Number one, Ukraine is known — before him — for tremendous corruption.  Tremendous.  More than just about any country in the world.  In fact, they’re rated one of the most corrupt countries in the world.  And I don’t like giving money to a country that’s that corrupt.\nNumber two, I said —\nQ    You don’t like giving money?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Excuse me.  Number two, I said the following — and I said this loud and clear to everybody.  And, in fact, Rob Portman backed me up, and there’s nobody more honorable than Rob Portman of Ohio.  Because he called up: “Please, let the money go.”  I said, “Rob, I hate being the country that’s always giving money when Ukraine helps Europe and the European countries far more than they help us.”  They’re like a wall between Russia and Europe.  They’re like a wall.  They’re a big, wide, beautiful wall.\nAnd he said, “You know what?  But it’s important.”  And he — in fact, he came out and he said that.  That was my only reason.  Because I don’t like being the sucker country.  We were the sucker country for years and years.  We’re not the sucker country anymore.\nBut I gave the money because Rob Portman and others called me and asked.  But I don’t like to be the sucker.  And European countries are helped far more than we are, and those countries should pay more to help Ukraine.\nGo ahead.  Ask a question, please.\nQ    Thank you, sir.  Mr. —\nQ    What about Biden?  What about Mr. Biden?\nQ    What did you want about Biden?  What did you want him to look into on Biden?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Look, Biden and his son are stone-cold crooked.  And you know it.  His son walks out with millions of dollars.  The kid knows nothing.  You know it, and so do we.\nGo ahead.  Ask a question now.\nQ    The question, sir, was: What did you want President Zelensky to do about Vice President Biden and his son, Hunter?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Are you talking to me?\nQ    Yeah.  It was a just a follow-up of what I just asked you, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  (Inaudible) finish with me.  Listen.  Listen.  Are you ready?  We have the President of Finland.  Ask him a question.\nQ    I have one for him.  I just wanted to follow up on the one that I asked you, which was —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Did you hear me?\nQ    — what did you want him to —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Did you hear me?\nQ    Yes, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Ask him a question.\nQ    I will, but —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I’ve given you a long answer.  Ask this gentleman a question.  Don’t be rude.\nQ    No, sir.  I don’t want to be rude.  I just wanted you to have a chance to answer the question that I asked you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I’ve answered everything.  It’s a whole hoax.  And you know who’s playing into the hoax?  People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country.  And I say, in many cases, the “corrupt media” — because you’re corrupt.  Much of the media in this country is not just fake, it’s corrupt.\nAnd you have some very fine people, too — great journalists, great reporters.  But, to a large extent, it’s corrupt and it’s fake.\nAsk the President of Finland a question, please.\nQ    Okay.  I’ll move on now.  Mr. President, in your opening remarks, you said to President Trump that you had been to some museums today and that you respected the U.S. democracy and encouraged him to continue it.  Are you concerned that that’s not happening?\nAnd my second question to you, sir, is: The WTO ruled today in favor of the United States, saying that the United States can now impose tariffs on European goods because of illegal subsidies against Airbus.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  That was a big win for the United States, right?\nQ    It was a big a win for the United States.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  You never had wins with other Presidents, did you?  But we’re having a lot of wins at the WTO since I became President.\nQ    This was a case that started, I think, 10 or 15 years ago.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.  Okay.\nQ    But it —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Excuse me.  Your wins are now, because they think I don’t like the WTO, and they want to make sure I’m happy.  Because all of those countries were ripping off the United States for many years.  They know that I’m wise to it.  We’ve had a lot of wins.\nThis was a $7 billion win.  Not bad.  Go ahead.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  But I think the question is for me.\nQ    So the question, sir, is if you’re concerned that the President will impose those tariffs and the effect that that may have on the economy.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  Yes.  First of all, when I referred to your democracy, I just wanted to tell that I’m impressed what American people have gained during these decades — a hundred-so years — building up very impressive democracy.  So, keep it going on.\nTo WTO: I have a lot of respect to multilateralism and to international institutions.  So, WTO has given now a decision which is, well, quite tough with Europe.  But I just say that the WTO has set its opinion, and that’s that.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And I just want to finish by saying it’s an honor to be with the President of Finland.  He’s done a fantastic job.  Very popular, beloved over in Finland.\nThe WTO has been much better to us since I’ve been President because they understand they can’t get away with what they’ve been getting away with for so many years, which is ripping off the United States.\nAnd please remember the President’s last remarks: that we are a great democracy.  We are a great — the United States is a great democracy.  And I’m airing what I’m airing because we are, in fact, a democracy.  And if the press were straight and honest and forthright and tough, we would be a far greater nation.\nQ    We are, Mr. President.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  We would be a far greater when we don’t have the CNNs of the world, who are corrupt people.  Thank you very much, everybody.\nEND\n3:05 P.M.

        "text": "Oval Office12:08 P.M. EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, thank you very much.  It’s a great honor to have a man that’s become a friend of mine — we’ve gotten to know each other well — the President of Finland.  And we have many things to discuss, including trade and military and purchases, and lots of different very exciting events.\nSo we’ll have a long time together today.  We’ll then be having lunch.  And I think we’re going to be seeing the media right afterwards and say a few words.\nBut it’s an honor, Mr. President, to have you with us.  Thank you.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  I’m waiting for our discussions.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes.  Yes.  See?  He’s made a few words, and he gets it done.  (Laughter.)  That’s what I like about him.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  (Laughs.)  Hope so.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  That’s what I like about him.\nAnyway, okay, thank you all very much.\nQ    How do you respond to concerns that you are putting the whistleblower’s life in danger?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, the whistleblower was very inaccurate.  The whistleblower started this whole thing by writing a report on the conversation I had with the President of Ukraine.  And the conversation was perfect; it couldn’t have been nicer.\nI saw Rick Scott, I saw many of the senators talking about it, many of the congressmen talking about.  Not a thing wrong.  Unless you heard the Adam Schiff version, where he made up my conversation.  He actually made it up.  It should be criminal.  It should be treasonous.  He made it up — every word of it, made up — and read to Congress as though I said it.\nAnd I’ll tell you what: He should be forced to resign from Congress — Adam Schiff.  He’s a lowlife.  He should be forced to resign.  He took a perfect conversation, realized he couldn’t read it to Congress because it was perfect; it was a very nice conversation.  I knew many people were on the phone.  Not only were many people on the phone, we had stenographers on the phone taking it down, word for word.\nHe took that conversation, which was perfect; he said, “I can’t read this.”  So he made up a conversation and he reported it and said it to Congress and to the American people.  And it was horrible was he said.  And that was supposed to be coming from me, but it was all fabricated.\nHe should resign from office in disgrace.  And, frankly, they should look at him for treason because he is making up the words of the President of the United States.  Not only words, but the meaning.  And it’s a disgrace.  It should not be allowed to happen.\nQ    But your own DNI said the call transcript was consistent with the complaint.   So, should only whistleblowers —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, no, no, he didn’t say that.  You have to take a look.\nQ    He did say that.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, no, no.  He did not say that.  And, in fact, if you look at what he said, he found everything to be very normal.  He’s a good man, and — Joe.  And he found it to be very normal.  I saw Schiff trying to go 15 — you know, we call him “Shifty Schiff.”  We don’t call him “Shifty Schiff” for nothing.  He’s a shifty, dishonest guy — who, by the way, was critical of one of the great Secretary of States.  Graduated number one in his class at West Point.  Graduated top of — one of the top in his class at Harvard Law School.  The most honorable person, Mike Pompeo.  And this guy was negative on Mike Pompeo.\nHe can’t — you know, there’s an expression: He couldn’t carry his “blank” strap.  I won’t say it because they’ll say it was so terrible to say.  But that guy couldn’t carry his “blank” strap.  You understand that?\nSo, you’re dealing with bad people.  And, you know, I watched China over the last few days, and I watched some of these other countries build up, build up, build up.  And we’ve built up more than any of them because of me, but no help due to the Democrats.  They’re a disaster.  They’re the “do-nothing” Democrats.  They don’t do any work.  All they want to do is try and win the election in 2020, so they come up with this impeachment nonsense.\nAnd everyone knows the conversation — all based on a phone call that I had, where I’m talking to the President of Ukraine.  You’ll hear from our ambassadors, you’ll hear from some of the folks that know all about the call — why the call was set up and everything else.  It’s perfect.  The call was perfect.\nIn fact, Lindsey Graham said, “I didn’t know you could be so nice.”  There was no quid pro quo.  Remember, before they saw — the only reason I put that out — and I did it with the approval of Ukraine, by the way; otherwise, I couldn’t have done it — was because the whistleblower was so dishonest.  The whistleblower said terrible things about the call, but he then — I then found out he was second-hand and third-hand.  In other words, he didn’t know what was on the call.\nNo, these are bad people.  These are dishonest people.  And when the American people find out what happened, it’s going to be a great day.  And you know what?  We have to go back to building our country, because 99 percent of Nancy Pelosi’s time is spent on this.  She should worry about lowering the price of drugs, which I’ve done.  But it’s hard to do it without the help of Congress — about creating border security, which I’ve done.\nWe’ve built — we now have hundreds of miles of wall under construction on the southern border.  She should worry about infrastructure.  She should worry about the USMCA.  She’s not doing it.  I just saw a part of her press conference before the President came.  And I’m sorry to bother you with this, Mr. President, because we have other things to talk about.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  (Inaudible.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  But I will tell you, I just watched part — she says, “Oh, drug prices…”  Well, she’s been trying to get drug prices down for — how long has she been in Congress?  For years.  She should focus on her own district.  Do you see what’s happening to her district?  We call it “tent city.”  It’s terrible.  In fact, we just sent a violation to the city of San Francisco: unsafe water, unsafe conditions, environmental — EPA.\nOur EPA, which is doing a great job, is sending Nancy Pelosi, with all the talk about EPA — there’s needles and drugs all over the street.  There’s tents.  There’s people that are dying in squalor in the best location, in San Francisco.  It used to be a great city.  Now, you have to see what’s happened to San Francisco.  You happen to see what — what’s — what the Democrats have allowed to happen.  As an example, what they’ve allowed to happen, just take a look, to Los Angeles.  Great cities.\nOne other thing: Yesterday, as you know, I was sued by the Governor, Gavin Newsom — he’s another beauty.  I was sued by him.  He’s a do-nothing.  Sued by him so that I can’t get on the ballot in the state of California.  It was a massive story.  It was the biggest story, Mr. President.  It was headlines all over the place: “Trump gets sued by this do-nothing governor in California.”  It was big.\nHere’s what happened: Yesterday, I won the case, very convincingly.  A very tough, smart, highly respected judge — not a Trump person at all — not appointed by Trump; appointed by somebody that you would call the opposition — came out with a scathing and tough opinion.  I won the case.  I didn’t see one story that I won that case — not one story — from the fake news.  I didn’t see Steve write it.  I didn’t see you write it.  I didn’t see anybody write it.\nSo, let me just tell you, just to finish: Nancy Pelosi and Shifty Shifft [sic] — who should resign in disgrace, by the way — and Jerry Nadler and all of them, it’s a disgrace what’s going on.  And we should be focused on making America great again and keeping America great, because that’s what we have to do.\nAnd when I look at that parade with military and millions of people and everything else, we better get smart.  We better start focusing on the right things.  Because what they did with this nonsense — think of it: You have a perfect — I mean, perfect, conversation with a President of another country — Ukraine, in this case — and they try and say, “Oh, let’s impeach him.”\nThey’ve been trying to impeach me from the day I got elected.  I’ve been going through this for three years.  They’ve been trying to impeach me from the day I got elected.  And you know what?  They failed.  And this is the easiest one of all, because this one is based on one conversation.\nWhat about Obama’s conversation with the President of Russia, where he says, “Hey, hey, tell Vlad I’ll talk to him after the election is over.  I’ll talk to him…”  Nobody reports that, right?  That’s stuff you should report.\nBut you people should be ashamed of yourself.  We have the most dishonest media that you can imagine.  And you should be ashamed of yourselves.\nOkay, I think I’ve answered most of your questions.  What do you think?\nYes?\nQ    Finnish media here.  Finland is the happiest country in the world.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Finland is a happy country.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  Yeah, for sure.\nQ    What can you learn?  What can you learn from Finland, which has a social-democratic (inaudible)?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, you got rid of Pelosi and you got rid of Shifty Schiff.\nPRESIDENT NIINISTÖ:  We have time to discuss about that.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Finland is a happy country.  He’s a happy leader, too.  (Laughs.)\nQ    Some Republicans have raised concerns —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  No Republicans have raised concerns.\nQ    — about the whistleblower, that their name — that the identity of the whistleblower should be protected.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I don’t care.  Look, I think a whistleblower should be protected if the whistleblower is legitimate.  But when the whistleblower makes a big report on the conversation I had with a President, of Ukraine, and it was a great conversation.  It was per- — we talked mostly about “congratulations on your win.”  We talked about corruption.  And we’re really referring mostly to 2016, because what the Democrats did in 2016 was corrupt.\nAnd let’s see what happens.  They’re more concerned with that than they are with me and impeachment.  They’re trying to hide what maybe is coming.  I let our great — if you look — I’ll let our great law enforcement take care of it.  Okay?\nAttorney General Barr, I guess, is working on it.  And I hope he’s working on it.  Because what happened in 2016 is a disgrace to this country.  And they’re more worried about that because they know they’re guilty as hell.  All right?  They’re much more worried about that.\nQ    Is the whistleblower immediately illegitimate if they are reporting misconduct about you?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  When a whistleblower —\nQ    About you, sir?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Okay.  Are you ready?\nI heard the whistleblower’s report from you people, and how bad it was about just a simple conversation.\nBy the way, this whole thing revolves around a simple conversation.  And if you remember at the beginning, it was “quid pro quo.”  That’s all you heard about.  And I think he said seven or eight times: “quid pro…” — in other words, “You’re going to that or we’re not going to give you money.  You’re going to do this or we’re not going to…”  I never said it.\nBut when I heard these horrible stories come out, I had no choice but to release a conversation — which I hate to do, and I hope I don’t have to do it again — with the leader of a country.  I asked a certain person to call up a certain person in that country to get permission to do it; otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to do it.  And if I didn’t do it — and I appreciate Ukraine for allowing us to release the conversation.  But it was so innocent, it didn’t hurt them.  If anything, it helped them because it was a very innocent conversation.\nBut when a whistleblower takes that very nice, innocent — Lindsey Graham said, “I never knew you were that nice a person.”  He said, “You never asked him for anything.  You were really, really nice.”  Lindsey was saying, “I never knew you were so nice.  That was a perfect conversation.”\nI heard Rick Scott today say, “That was a perfect conversation.  How can they impeach him on that conversation?”  He read it.  He’s a very smart guy from Florida — Rick Scott — and he said, “That was a perfect conversation.  How can you impeach somebody on that conversation?”\nBut the whistleblower wrote not that conversation.  He wrote a vicious conversation.  In other words, he either got it totally wrong, made it up, or the person giving the information to the whistleblower was dishonest.  And this country has to find out who that person was, because that person is a spy, in my opinion.\nAre you ready?  So, when a whistleblower, purposely or not, gives something that’s totally erroneous — now, here’s where I fooled them.  They never thought I’d release the conversation.  They never thought in a million years that I’d release the conversation.\nWhen “Liddle'” Adam Schiff saw the text, when he read it, he couldn’t believe it.  When Nancy Pelosi, who worked a day early — Nancy Pelosi called for essentially impeachment — “Let’s impeach the President” — before she saw the transcript.  And this is an exact word-for-word transcript of the conversation, right?  Taken by very talented stenographers.\nQ    Well —\nPRESDENT TRUMP:  Listen to me.\nSo when she saw that, she was — she — I heard she went crazy.  She said, “We can’t impeach him on this conversation.  That’s a great conversation.”  She went by the whistleblower.  And the whistleblower was so bad, I would even think about it.\nBut here’s what happened: The whistleblower was wrong.  The only thing that matters is the transcript of the actual conversation that I had with the President of Ukraine.  It was perfect.  We’re looking at congratulations.  We’re looking at doing things together.  And what are we looking at?  We’re looking at corruption.\nAnd, in, I believe, 1999, there was a corruption act or a corruption bill passed between both — and signed — between both countries, where I have a duty to report corruption.  And let me tell you something: Biden’s son is corrupt, and Biden is corrupt.  And I’d rather run against Biden than almost any of those candidates.  And I think they’re all weak.  But I think Biden has never been a smart guy, and he’s less smart now than he ever was.\nThank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.\nQ    Sir, have you actually wanted a moat on the border, sir?  Sir, did you suggest a moat?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:   Oh.  Let me do that again; it’s a fair question.  So this morning and last night, my comms people came to me.  Listen to this one, President.  I’m glad they’re interested in Finland, but what can you do?  I’m interested in Finland much more.\nBut my comms people came to me, and they said, “Sir, there’s a book or something being written.”  It’s written by Washington Post people, so you know it’s inaccurate.  You know it’s probably a fraud.\nSo two reporters from the Washington — and they said, “President Trump started screaming, ranting, and raving, that on the southern border…” — where we are right now building a tremendous wall; it’s unbelievable what’s going up.  Army Corps of Engineers.  It’s — we’re doing a lot.  We have — we’ll soon have over 100 miles under construction and completed.  We’re going to end up with over 400 to 500 miles.\nOkay, ready?  That I wanted a wall, but I wanted a moat.  A moat — whatever that is.  It’s not a word I used, but they used it.  A moat.  And in the moat, I wanted alligators and snakes.  And I wanted the wall to be a fence, and I wanted it to be electrified.  And I wanted sharp spikes at the top, so if anyone gets it, it goes piercing through their skin — is somewhat the way they said it.  Skin-piercing spikes.  But I want the whole wall to be electrocuted.\nAnd, “Sir, you never said that.”  They came to me — the comms people.  They came to me yesterday.  And they said, “Did you say this?”  I said, “Why are you asking that stupid question?”  “Because the fake news media is saying that you said this in a book.”  I said, “What book?”  And they said, “Washington Post.”  I said, “Well, obviously it’s fake because almost everything the Washington Post does is fake.”\nIt’s a fake newspaper.  It’s owned by a rich guy for the purposes of giving him power in Washington.  It’s really — I mean, it’s a lobbyist — I call it the “Lobbyist Washington Post” — for Amazon.  And he ought to be ashamed of himself, because what they do to his reputation — I think maybe it’s probably no good anyway.  But what they do to his reputation with the Washington Post is a disgrace.\nSo these two reporters wrote this book, and they said I want a moat with alligators, snakes, electrified fences so people get electrocuted if they so much as touch the fence, and spikes on top.  Never said it.  Never thought of it.  And I actually put out something on social media today.  I said, I’m tough on the border, but I’m not that tough.\nOkay.  It was a lie.  Just so you have it — you asked the question.  It was a total lie.  It was corrupt reporting.  Okay?\nQ    Did you suggest —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I don’t even “fake” anymore; I call the fake news now, “corrupt news.”  Because “fake” isn’t tough enough, and I’m the one that came up with the term — I’m very proud of it — but I think I’m going to switch it largely to “corrupt news.”  Because the media in this country — not everybody; we have some great reporters, some great journalists.  But much of it is corrupt.  It’s corrupt.  You have corrupt media in this country.  And it truly is the enemy of the people.\nThank you very much.  Thank you.  Have a good day, everybody.  Go write some phony stories.\nGo write some phony stories.  Go write a Schiff-like story.\nJust another day in paradise.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you, Steve.  I hope I answered all your questions.\nQ    I didn’t get — I didn’t get one in.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  What?\nQ    I was going to ask you (inaudible) limit the number of people who are listening on those phone calls —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I might.  I might.  Yeah.  I — and, by the way, I assume many people.  I always do.  When I speak to a leader — if I speak to Finland, I always assume that many people are listening.\nQ    Yeah.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And the other thing is that Nancy Pelosi’s account of my phone call is a total lie.  I called her about guns, and then I heard her — she’s talking about impeachment.  I said, “What are you talking about — impeachment?”  I called her to say I’m making big progress on guns, okay?\nFellas, I don’t know if you’re with us, here.\nQ    (Inaudible) not here.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  But I’m saying that — and I think you have to put that out.  That would be the only thing.  All right.  Good.\nQ    Thank you, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Good.  Thank you, Steve.  It was a lie.  Her statement was a lie.  But, you know, what else is new?\nThank you, everybody.\nEND\n12:26 P.M.

        "text": "Oval Office2:18 P.M. EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, this is a very big day.  We just had the swearing-in.  We just had the most beautiful ceremony.  I don’t know if anybody was there, of you, but — our new head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  And now we have Department of Labor.  So, that’s big stuff.  This is a big day.\nAnd it’s my pleasure to welcome everyone to the swearing-in of our new Secretary of Labor, Eugene Scalia.  Gene is joined by many members of his family, which is a large family, including his mother, Maureen, who’s been my friend for a long time, even before I knew you.  Right?  His mother is an incredible woman.  And his wife, Patricia.  Incredible job.  Thank you, honey.  And six of their beautiful children.\nAnd I have a list of the folks.  It’s like — what a family.  So you have Maureen, who a lot of the people in this room know, from the standpoint even of the media.  You have Patricia, who is a very powerful person in the family — namely, the wife.  (Laughter.)  The wife is always powerful — or, in some cases, right?  But in this case —\nMR. SCALIA:  This one is.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Super powerful, right?\nAntonin Scalia’s son.  Antonin.  We have Megan Scalia, daughter; Bridget Scalia, daughter; Luke Scalia, son; Erin Scalia, daughter; Isabella Scalia, daughter.  That’s pretty impressive.  John Scalia, brother.  Catherine Courtney, sister.  Mary Clare Murray, sister.  Reverend Paul Scalia, who many of the folks know, in the room.  The most powerful man, by far, in the room.  Reverend Paul Scalia, brother.  Christopher Scalia, brother.  Margaret Scalia Bryce, sister.  Christie S. Larsen — oh, wow — father-in-law.  Susan Larsen, mother-in-law.  That’s powerful.  That’s powerful stuff.  That’s a great — that’s a great family.\nAnd, as you know, this was just happened — confirmed as the 20th Secretary of Labor, on September 26th, by a very substantial vote in current politics.  Some people would say, “Gee, that was close.”  53 to 44.  I call that a landslide.  (Laughter.)  In this administration, I call it a landslide.\nEugene Scalia is one of the most qualified people ever confirmed as Secretary of Labor.  He will use his skills as he has over the years, and he’s built an extremely distinguished career to fight and win for the American workforce.  He’s a tremendous lawyer, a tremendous talent.  One of the best anywhere in our country.\nHe earned a bachelor’s degree from University of Virginia, and went on to the University of Chicago Law School, where he was editor-in-chief of the Law Review.\nFrom 2002 to 2003, Gene served as the top legal officer at the Department of Labor.  So he’s very familiar with the environs.  He earned a reputation as a brilliant and unbiased defender of rights and protections of the American people.\nAfter his time in government service, Gene moved to the private sector, where he really became a tremendous force and very successful.  He fought in some of the highest courts of our land, and worked to overturn bureaucratic overreach and unfair, job-killing regulations.  That sounds very familiar.  That’s going to be good in this administration.\nAs he returns to the Department of Labor, Gene will use his wealth of experience to continue our bold regulatory reduction campaign.  Most importantly, he will always put American workers first.  I know that very well.  That’s what he’s done his whole life.\nAnd your father is looking down right now.  Your husband is looking down right now and proud as can be.  You know that.  You understand that.  He’s looking down and he is beaming.  And I knew him well enough to know that he was a beamer when he was proud, right?\nMRS. MAUREEN SCALIA:  Yes.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  So, Gene, I’m confident that your sharp legal mind, firmness of character, devotion to justice, love for this country, and commitment to its people will make you an outstanding Secretary of Labor.  I want you to be the best.  Can we say “the best of all time”?  I’ll ask you, maybe later, who was the best, so far.  But you’re going to top.\nCongratulations to you and to your wonderful family.\nAnd I’d like to now have Gene just say a few words and then we’ll ask Vice President Pence to administer the oath of office.  And thank you all for being here.  This is a very important day.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you.\nMR. SCALIA:  Mr. President, thank you for those remarks.  Thank you for this great honor to serve as Secretary of Labor.  And thank you for what’s also a great opportunity, as well, to hold that position in this administration with a President who’s willing to try things that are different, not necessarily conventional, and as you remarked a moment ago, prepared to fight for things that he considers are important for the American people.\nYou offered this job to me back in July, in this office.  And in that meeting, you expressed to me your commitment to American workers and to our economy.  And I will bear those words in mind every day that I serve as Secretary of Labor.\nI also want to thank the President for the kindness that he has, in fact, shown my mother since even before his inauguration.  It’s a story few people know.  I’m fixing that right now, I think.  But he reached out to my mother for — just out of kindness, with no political advantage, to see how she was doing, to then make sure that she had a good inauguration seat and the like.  And he looked after an elderly woman who was going through a difficult time and gave her some help and support when it meant an awful lot.  And we’re very grateful.\nI do want to thank my mother, as well; my father who we do like to think is looking down and watching with some pride.  And, of course, I want to thank my wife Trish for all of the support that she has given me, both in recent weeks, but throughout our marriage.  And my brothers and sisters, too.\nMr. President, I’m sorry that the group is — might strike you as small.  (Laughter.)  There were three who couldn’t make it, but they’re here in spirit, too.\nSo, again, I want to thank the President and the Vice President for what is a great honor, but, more importantly to me, it’s an opportunity to further the mission of the Department of Labor; to implement this President’s agenda; and, to paraphrase the Constitution, to take care that our laws are faithfully executed.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  Congratulations.  Fantastic.  (Applause.)\nMike?  Thanks.\n(The oath is administered.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Congratulations, Mr. Secretary.\nSECRETARY SCALIA:  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you all very much.  Thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you very much, everybody.\nQ    Do you know who the whistleblower is, sir?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, we’re trying to find out about a whistleblower — when you have a whistleblower that reports things that were incorrect.  As you know, and you probably now have figured it out, the statement I made to the President of Ukraine — a good man, a nice man, new — was perfect.  It was perfect.  But the whistleblower reported a totally different statement.  Like, the statement, it’s — it was not even made.  I guess “statement,” you could say, was the call.  I made a call.  The call was perfect.\nWhen the whistleblower reported it, he made it sound terrible.  And then, you had Adam Schiff who, even worse, made up my words, which I think is just a horrible.  I’ve never even seen a thing like that.\nAdam Schiff — representative, congressman — made up what I said.  He actually took words and made it up.  The reason is, when he saw my call to the President of Ukraine, it was so good that he couldn’t quote from it because it — there was nothing done wrong.  It was perfect.  So Adam Schiff decided, “I can’t let this happen, so let me make up…” — did you ever hear of this one, Gene?  You ever hear a thing like this?  So Adam Schiff made up a phony call.  And he read it to Congress and he read it to the people of the United States.  And it’s a disgrace.  This whole thing is a disgrace.\nThere’s been tremendous corruption.  And we’re seeking it.  It’s called “drain the swamp.”  There’s been corruption on the other side.  There’s been corruption like you’ve never seen.\nNow, the new President of Ukraine ran on the basis of no corruption.  That’s how he got elected.  And I believe that he really means it.  But there was a lot of corruption having to do with the 2016 election against us.  And we want to get to the bottom of it, and it’s very important that we do.\nThank you very much.\nEND\n2:29 P.M.

EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mike.  And I have to start off by saying that all of my life I’ve heard that if it rains on a big occasion, it brings luck.  So, Mark, I think you’re going to be the luckiest general in history.  (Laughter.)\nI want to thank everybody for being here — Vice President Pence.  And thank you all for the incredible service members.  We have the finest military anywhere in the world.  The American military is the greating — greatest fighting force, without question, in the history of the world.  And today it’s stronger than it’s ever been, by a large factor.  No enemy on Earth can match the awesome might of the American Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and the United States Marines.\nWe’re gathered together for a truly historic occasion.  We’re here to welcome our outstanding new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: General Mark Milley.  Mark, I want to congratulate you.  You’re my friend.  You’re my advisor.  And you deserve this position.  I never had a doubt.  Congratulations.  (Applause.)\nI also want to express our profound gratitude to Mark’s wife Hollyanne, and his children, Mary and Peter, for their selfless devotion to our country.  The strength of our military is truly found in the love and support of our military families.  So important.  Those families are so important.\nWe’re especially honored to be joined by some of America’s Gold Star Families.  Your treasured loved ones made the supreme sacrifice for our nation.  They’re looking down on you right now.  You look up in the sky, and they’re looking down on you.  Our debt to you is infinite and eternal.  America will hold you in its heart forever.  And we will never forget.\nWe’re also grateful to the many veterans here today.  (Applause.)  To our heroic wounded warriors in attendance: Our nation will always remember what you did for the cause of freedom.\nJoining us as well are: Secretary Mark Esper.  Thank you, Mark.  Great job you’re doing.  Secretary Mike Pompeo.  Mike, thank you very much.  EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler.  Thank you, Andrew.  Many of our great secretaries and my Cabinet and service chiefs.\nI know we have a couple of wonderful representatives — I think you have many, so I’ll get myself in trouble, but I see John Carter and I see Brad Wenstrup.  Thank you very much for being here, fellas.  Thank you very much.  And I see a senator that’s so supportive of our military and this administration, Senator Dan Sullivan.  Thank you, Dan — of Alaska.  Done a great job.\nAs we prepare to welcome a new Chairman, we must first pay tribute to one of America’s most admired and beloved military leaders: outgoing Chairman Joseph Dunford, here today with his wonderful wife, Ellyn.\nJoe Dunford hails from just outside Boston.  His father was a Marine — and a tough one — who landed on Inchon, in Korea, and fought at the Chosin Reservoir.  So, Joe knew which branch he was destined to join.  He didn’t have too much of a decision to make, I think.  What do you think about that?  Huh?  Not a big decision?  No.\nIn 1977, he was commissioned into the U.S. Marine Corps.\nIn 2003, Joe commanded some of the first American troops in Operation Iraqi Freedom — and very, very successfully commanded them.  For his exceptional bravery, he received the Legion of Merit with Combat Valor.\nAs a general, Joe was promoted so quickly that he was nominated for his third star before he had formally received his second.  How do you do that?  How do you do that, Joe?\nIn 2013, he was named International Security Assistance Force Commander in Afghanistan.  And he was instrumental in strengthening Afghan security forces to share more of the burden.  And today, they are indeed sharing much more of the burden.\nIn 2014, Joe became Commandant of the Marine Corps, and the next year he was named Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  And in that role, Joe published the first Joint Military Net Assessment in 20 years.  We have a lot of the ideas that we’ve brought forward.  And, you know, we’ve spent $2.5 trillion since I’m President — $2.5 trillion — far more than this country has ever even thought about spending.  But we had to have a modern, great military with the most magnificent and the finest machinery, planes, boats, ships, weapons of all kinds.  We’ve never had anything like you have today.  When I took over, we were a very depleted military, and today we’re at a level that we have never even come close to.\nJoe solidified America’s competitive advantage through global integration of the Joint Force.  He also provided critical leadership during the complete rebuilding of our military.\nAnd he helped me in another way — something that probably only Joe and Ellyn really know — because in, I would say, in 2015, I sat with Joe at a dinner.  And believe it or not, I was getting a big award from the Marines.  And Joe was presenting the awards, and I had no even thought of running for President.  And I said to my wife and family, “Look at that guy.  He’s a great looking guy, isn’t he?  He’s like central casting.  He’s like right out of Hollywood.”  But he made the great presentation that night.\nAnd I got to talk to him because I sat with him and Ellyn and his son, Patrick.  And I was asking Joe lots of questions about the military.  He said, “You really enjoy this, don’t you?”  I said, “Well, I just love our country.  It’s very important to me.  I love our country.”  And I said, “I don’t know.  What do you think?  Should I give it a shot?”  This was before it was public.  He was one of the first people I asked.  I said, “What do you think?  You think I’d have a shot?  If I get it, we’re going to rebuild that military.  It’s going to be stronger than ever before.”\nAnd he helped me form an opinion.  He gave me a lot of information.  And he has ever since.  So, for that, I want to thank you and Ellyn, and I want to thank Patrick.  I hope I got his name right.  It was a long time ago, but I think his name was Patrick, right?  Huh?  Did I do good?  (Laughter.)\nBut General Dunford also provided vital strategic direction to the campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.  With his help and the great courage of our warfighters, I am proud to say that the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent completely obliterated.  When we came to office, it was a mess; it was all over.  Now we have thousands of captured ISIS fighters, and we have 100 percent of the caliphate.\nAs Chairman, Joe has also been a strong supporter and crucial advocate for creating the sixth branch of the U.S.  Armed Forces — something that I’m really proud about and something that, when I make these speeches in these massive arenas loaded up with people, thousands and thousands, it just about gets the number one line of applause because I say, “We’re creating the Space Force.”  And the place goes crazy.  Great popularity, because that’s where it’s going to be at, more and more.\nGeneral, your life exemplifies those words that beat in the heart of every Marine: Semper Fi.  America salutes your incredible legacy of noble service.  You’ve been exceptional.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Joe.  (Applause.)  I think they like you, Joe.\nAs one exceptional Chairman departs, our nation gains another.  Today, Mark Milley takes General Dunford’s place as the highest-ranking member of the most skilled, determined, and powerful military ever assembled in human history.\nMark has been preparing for his duty his entire life.  Like Joe, he grew up in a family of patriots just outside of Boston.  His dad was a Navy corpsman, and tough as can be, they say.  Was he that tough?\nGENERAL MILLEY:  He was that tough.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Huh?  No games?  He didn’t play games?\nGENERAL MILLEY:  No.  No.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  He says, “No games.”\nBut his dad was a strong Navy corpsman, serving with the 4th Marine Division in World War Two — a veteran of the assault landings in the Marshall Islands campaign, the Mariana campaign, and in two Iwo Jima hits.  During the war, Mark’s mother also served at a Navy hospital in Seattle, treating wounded men from the Pacific.\nInspired by their example, Mark chose the path of duty and the life of service.  He could have done whatever he wanted.  He was exceptional in every way.\nIn 1980, he was commissioned into the Army, and quickly joined the ranks of its finest soldiers.  He graduated from the Army Ranger School and became a master parachutist and a Green Beret.  In a long Army career, Mark deployed to Panama, Colombia, Korea, Somalia, Egypt, Haiti, Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan — often seeing very, very close up the combat.\nHe has not just served, but shown immense valor, on nearly every continent.  He is the recipient of the Distinguished Service Medal, four Bronze Stars, and the Legion of Merit, along with two awards of the Combat Infantry Badge.\nWith degrees from Princeton, Columbia — wow, I didn’t know you were such a great academic.  (Laughter.)  Wow, let me give you a little more.  (Laughter.)  I’m impressed with that.  That’s very good.  And the Naval War College — but I liked you anyway — Mark is living proof that the American warfighter is the toughest, smartest and bravest, best and brightest, by far, anywhere in the world.\nFollowing four deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, he became the 39th Chief of Staff of the Army in 2015.  Over the last several years, he has worked tirelessly to rebuild a depleted force into a fully manned, fully trained, and fully equipped Army prepared to achieve complete victory in the conflicts of tomorrow.\nAnd when we were determining where we were going to spend all of these billions of dollars, like you’ve never seen — we haven’t seen it in decades — I went with Mark, I sat with Mark, and I hope we spent it wisely, and I know we spent it wisely.  Two and a half trillion dollars.\nHe built the Army Futures Command, and he created Security Force Assistance Brigades to reduce the need for large deployments.\nWhen Mark took over, only two Brigade Combat Teams were at the highest levels of readiness.  Today, that number stands at 28 — an extraordinary turnaround and achievement.  And I congratulate everybody here today.  (Applause.)\nAmerica’s Armed Forces are more powerful than ever and growing even stronger.  We have the newest equipment, and we also have equipment that we keep under wraps that nobody has ever even heard of.  We have weapons that we pray to God we never have to use.  Our nuclear has been totally rebuilt; some brand new and some refurbished.  But we hope to God we never have to use any of our weapons — any of our weapons.\nIn his new role as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Milley will serve as my top military advisor.  I have absolute confidence that he will fulfill his duty with the same brilliance and fortitude he has shown throughout his long and very distinguished career.\nFrom the great General Omar Bradley to the famed Joe Dunford, our nation has been blessed by the advice, counsel, and wisdom of 19 Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Today, we pass the baton to the 20th.\nTogether, we vow to continue the righteous mission that has united every Chairman and every patriot ever to wear the uniform and to defend our great American flag.  We will keep America safe, we will keep America strong, and we will keep America proud so that our children and their children will forever and always be free.\nThank you again, General Dunford, for the incredible job you’ve done.  And to General Mark Milley: Good luck, Godspeed, God bless you, God bless our military, and God bless America.  Thank you all for being here.  Thank you very much.  It’s a great honor.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nEND\n12:05 P.M.

EDT\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Mr. President, Secretary Esper, Secretary Pompeo, members of the Cabinet, General Dunford, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and especially the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States: It’s an honor to be here, at “America’s post” — the home of the oldest active-duty infantry unit in the Army, the Old Guard — at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, as we install the 20th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark A. Milley.  (Applause.)\nToday, as we mark the beginning of General Milley’s tenure as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, we do well to pay a debt of gratitude to a man who has served this nation with distinction for now 42 years.  He led troops in battle during Operation Iraqi Freedom.  He served as Commandant of the Marine Corps.  And over the past five years, I can personally attest, during our tenure, I have witnessed his strong leadership and sound counsel at the highest levels of our military and our government.\nToday, we may a debt of gratitude to General Joseph F. Dunford.  Thank you for your service.  Thank you for being always faithful.  (Applause.)\nAnd to General Milley, the new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: I know I speak on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief and a grateful nation when I say to you and to your family, thank you for answering the call to serve once again.\nOver your nearly 40-year career, you’ve served with courage and distinction as a Green Beret.  You’ve led troops in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.  You served as the 39th Chief of Staff of the Army.  And as your tenure begins, General Milley, let me assure you, you have the confidence of your Commander-in-Chief, and you are carried with the confidence and the prayers of the American people.  Thank you for your leadership and service.  (Applause.)\nAnd, General Milley, as your tenure as Chairman begins, I know that you’ll be pleased to know that, thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump, you are inheriting the best-equipped, best-supplied, and best-trained military in the history of the world.\nThe United States military is the greatest force for good the world has ever known.  And since the first day of this administration, President Trump has taken decisive action to make the strongest military in the history of this planet stronger still.\nAfter years of budget cuts, President Trump fought for and secured the largest investment in our national defense in more than a generation, including the largest pay raise for our troops in more than a decade.  (Applause.)\nAnd at the President’s direction, we produced a National Security Strategy that puts America first.  Initiated the modernization of our nuclear arsenal.  Our NATO Allies are contributing more to our common defense than ever before.  And with the strong support of leaders in Congress, we’re well on our way, at the President’s direction, to establishing the sixth branch of our Armed Forces.  The United States Space Force will soon be a reality.  (Applause.)\nAnd finally, Chairman Milley, as you know, this summer, thanks to the President’s strong leadership, Congress approved a budget deal that preserves the historic investments we’ve made in our national defense.  It provides for our veterans and ends the defense sequester once and for all.\nThe American people know that President Donald Trump has no higher priority than the safety and security of this nation.  And today, by providing renewed leadership to the Joint Chiefs in General Mark Milley, President Trump is proving once again that as Commander-in-Chief, he will provide for the common defense with unyielding strength.  And as he said, “We will defend our country, we will defend our people.”\nIt is my great honor to be with all of you and most especially with all of those who wear the uniform of our Armed Forces gathered here today, and all who are gathered here who have worn the uniform of the United States.\nAnd on this momentous occasion of the transfer of responsibility to the 20th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce your Commander-in-Chief and a great champion of all the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States, past, present, and future: the 45th President of the United States, President Donald Trump.  (Applause.)\nEND\n11:49 A.M.

EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:  That’s very nice.  Thank you.\nAUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  A lot of spirit.  (Applause.)  A lot of spirit.  How are you?\nWell, thank you all for being here today.  And I’m delighted to once again celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month with you at the White House.  Right?  (Applause.)\nThis evening, we come together to honor the devotion, and the drive, and the faith, and genius, and exceptional achievements of our incredible Hispanic American community, right?  (Applause.)\nEverybody here — Hispanic and/or Hispanic American — who isn’t?  (Applause.)  Do we have anybody?  Do we have anybody who isn’t?  I don’t think so.  How are you?  Great man of faith.  Great.\nHispanic Americans have been a big part of our national story from the very, very beginning of our country.  You work hard.  You raise your strong and beautiful families.  You care for your neighbors.  (Applause.)  You start businesses, you create jobs, and you teach your children to love our country and to cherish our God-given freedom.  Right?  (Applause.)\nHispanic Americans enrich America in countless ways, and we will always honor this solemn commitment to you.  I will always be with you, and I think you know that maybe better than anybody knows it.  (Applause.)  All of our citizens — every single day, we’re fighting for you.  We’re putting your needs, your families, and your futures first.  We’re putting America first.  We’re putting the people in this room — we’re putting you first.  All right?\nAnd we’re delighted to be joined for this special occasion by Vice President Mike Pence, who is doing a fantastic job.  (Applause.)  Say a couple of words, Mike.  Say a couple of words.  Come on.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you, Mr. President.  And it is wonderful to be here just a few short days before we kick off Hispanic Heritage Month.  The Americans gathered in this room, and all you represent stand for everything that’s great about this country and everything that this President and this administration fight for every day: faith and family and freedom.  Thank you for being here at the White House, and God bless you.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.\nWe have some very powerful, important people that have been doing a fantastic job on the Cabinet.  Administrator Andrew Wheeler — where’s Andrew?  Where is Andrew?  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Whoa, Andrew.  I thought you were taller than that.  I thought you were taller than that, Andrew.  (Laughter.)\nDeputy Secretary Patrick Pizzella.  Patrick.  Thank you.  Thank you, Patrick.  (Applause.)  Good job, Patrick.\nU.S. Treasurer — who everybody know — Jovita Carranza.  (Inaudible.) (Applause.)  Thank you, Jovita.\nA great football player at Ohio State — fantastic.  He went into the NFL and he was tough as can be.  A lot of people don’t know that.  He’s a tough cookie and he’s a friend of mine: Representative Anthony Gonzalez.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nAlong with a lot of other political people, and state and local leaders, and a lot of diplomats.  All the diplomats, thank you very much.  We always love diplomats in the White House because we can use diplomats sometimes.  (Laughter.)\nI also want to thank Christine D’Clario for her beautiful rendition of our National Anthem.  Thank you, Christine!  Great job.\nLast week, I had the privilege of awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to another phenomenal member of the Hispanic American community: the legendary pitcher for the New York Yankees — I think one of the great pitchers of all time; certainly, the greatest reliever of all time — Mariano Rivera.  (Applause.)\nHe was something.  Boy, his record — you know, he was up — and he’s been a friend of mine for a long time, and — as a Yankee fan.  But there’s never been any human being that broke more bats.  I said, “What do you do?”  He threw a heavy ball.  I said, “Mariano, how do you do that?”  He said, “I don’t know.  God just gave me this ability.”  (Applause.)\nBut you’d have people up there, and those bats were breaking left and right.  It was a heavy ball, and his record was incredible.\nHe — his earned run average in all of the playoffs — and I think he has a record for games played.  But his record was — his earned run average was less than one run a game.  And they won many, many World Series, and many games.  So he’s a special person and a really nice person, too.\nMariano is one of millions of the outstanding men and women of Hispanic heritage who has excelled in every dimension of American society, and helped to build our community into the greatest nation the world has ever seen.  (Applause.)\nToday, thanks to our pro-American economic policies — you all know this — Hispanic Americans are thriving like they have never thrived before.  (Applause.)\nWe’ve created more than 6 million new jobs since my election.  More than 1 million Latinas have entered the workforce.  (Applause.)  And, as you probably heard me say on occasion, Hispanic American unemployment right now is at the lowest level in the history of our country.  (Applause.)  How do they beat us in a debate?  When they say, “We’re going to get Hispanic vote…”  And I say, “Really?”  The lowest level in the history — I mean, it’s the lowest in the history of our country.  So that’s something special.  (Applause.)\nSince 2016, Hispanic American median household income has risen by $1,500, and is now the highest level in the history of our country.  (Applause.)  How about that?  Not doing bad, right?\nHalf a million more Hispanic Americans now own a home, and we’ve never seen these kind of numbers before.  So I’m very proud to report that more Latinas own small businesses than ever before.  (Applause.)  And — you know, great business people.  When I was out on that business market, I hated competing with you.  (Laughter.)  Smart and tough and vicious, but I won’t say that tonight.  (Laughter.)\nWe have one of these amazing entrepreneurs with us tonight. Maria Rios is the President and CEO of Nation Waste, Inc. And she’s got an incredible story to tell.  Maria, please come forward.  Please.  (Applause.)\nMS. RIOS:  Thank you, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, darling.\nMS. RIOS:  What an honor, my goodness.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  It’s my honor.\nMS. RIOS:  My honor.  Thank you very much.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  My honor.  Thank you.\nMS. RIOS:  Thank you.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Please.\nMS. RIOS:  Wow.  What an opportunity this is.  Thank you so much for this opportunity.  My name is Maria Rios, and I’m the president and CEO for Nation Waste.\nI came to America when I was 13, without knowing English, with my parents, because of a civil war from El Salvador.  And through education, and perseverance, and also hard work and work ethic, I am now the owner of Nation Waste — a fully-certified company in America.  (Applause.)\nI love creating jobs for more Americans.  And, to me, this is just a dream come true.  And I just cannot thank you enough for all the work that you are doing to help us small business owners to grow our businesses across the United States.\nI also want to say — thank Ivanka for what she’s doing — her leadership that she’s doing, as well.  (Applause.)  And the Vice President as well — for all the hard work that they’re doing.\nAnd I just want to say — you know, Nation Waste — who would have thought that this little girl, who came to America from El Salvador, not knowing English, went to school — through education — now owned a — not only — I’m the first Latina in the waste management industry in the country, and the largest multi-million-dollar company in the state of Texas.  (Applause.)\nI love creating jobs for more Americans, and I just thank God; and my parents — my mother, my father, and, of course, my husband and all my family; and my employees; and everyone that made this possible.\nSo, Mr. President, thank you for all that you’re doing for this great country.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you so much.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you, Maria.  That’s a fantastic job.  I was going to say maybe you should run for office, you did so well.  But after seeing how well she’s done, I think you should just continue to do what you’re doing.  You’re doing very well.  Thank you, Maria.\nAs we empower women in our own economy, last month, my daughter, Ivanka, traveled to South America — including Colombia, Paraguay, and Argentina — to highlight the W-GDP initiative, the critical role women play in creating economic opportunity, and the administration’s commitment to empowering women all around the world.  It was really something.\nAnd Ivanka has worked so hard for jobs and for women.  And gets no credit for it, but she doesn’t even care, I tell you.  (Applause.)  Well, she gets credit with the people that count.  You know that.  (Applause.)  That’s the people that we all know.  She has done, really, a fantastic job for women and also for jobs.  Thirteen million additional jobs.  And she’ll go around and see all of these big companies, and they’ll hire and really empower.  It’s something very special to watch.\nEvery day, my administration is working to deliver a more prosperous future.  America is winning again and America is being respected again like it hasn’t been respected in a long, long time.  (Applause.)\nOur country right now is more powerful than ever before.  We have achieved record funding for the U.S. military — two and a half trillion dollars over the last three years.  We’ve rebuilt it.  When I was just coming into office, our military was totally depleted.  It was depleted like you wouldn’t want to even hear about, and it’s been rebuilt.  And it’s bigger, better, stronger.  We have an amazing military.  Two and half trillion dollars.\nAnd we’ll work on the budgets.  But before we do the budgets, we have to rebuild our military.  I think you understand.  Otherwise — (applause) — otherwise budgets don’t matter, right?  Otherwise budgets don’t matter.\nAnd we delivered a beautiful pay raise also for every soldier, sailor, airman, Coast Guardsman, and Marine.  (Applause.)  So, they’re very happy.  More than a quarter of a million Hispanic Americans bravely serve in our Armed Forces.  That’s a lot of people.  And we’re profoundly grateful to each and every one of them.  (Applause.)  Great.\nAnd we’re also incredibly thankful for the thousands of Hispanic Americans serving on the frontlines, protecting our borders.  (Applause.)  And you know better than any people how important borders are.\nAUDIENCE:  Yes!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You know better than anybody.  You know, my poll numbers with Hispanics went way up.  And they said, “I wonder how that is?  You want strong borders.”  Well, the Hispanics know better than anyone.  (Applause.)  You don’t want people coming into our country that are going to do harm to you.  And, frankly, you don’t want people coming into our country that are going to take your jobs.  It’s very simple.\nSo, at first, I was even a little surprised to see those numbers.  Mike and I were discussing it.  And then, all of the sudden, it made a lot of sense.  It made a lot of sense.\nBut we — right now, Mexico has been a tremendous help to us — the President of Mexico.  We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our southern border.  They’ve never had any.  We’ve literally never had virtually any Mexican soldiers, and we have 27,000 now.  We can’t get the Democrats to do what they’re supposed to do with the loopholes or with asylum.  No, they’re not doing their job.  We call them the — they’re not — they’re not doing their job.  The “do-nothings,” right?  The do-nothings.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:  They’re not patriots!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  They’re not — well —\nAUDIENCE:  They hate America!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You can — (laughs).\nAUDIENCE:  They don’t love us!  They don’t love us!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You’re better off saying it.  You’re better — you’re better off saying it.  You people are really out there.\nAUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.\nAUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  So, we’re really doing a job with borders.  We’re really doing a job with the economy — number-one economy.  We’re at number one at everything.  We have the strongest military — by the way, strongest military by far, anywhere in the world.  And we’re going to keep it that way, if not make it even stronger.  More than —\nAnd, hopefully, by the way — hopefully, we don’t have to use it.  Hopefully — and, you know, interestingly, the stronger it gets, the less likely it is that we have to use it, you know?  That’s sort of the way it goes in life, unfortunately.\nMore than half of our Border Patrol agents are Hispanic, and more than a quarter of our ICE agents — and those ICE agents are incredible, and they are Hispanic.  And they are tough.  They are tough.  They’re patriots.\nAnd we’re — we’re moving MS-13 gang members and some of these horrible people — (applause) — boom.  They’re being brought out.  They’re being brought out of our country by the thousands — by the thousands.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS:  Bad hombres.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  And they are bad.  As you say, bad — they’re bad hombres.  You better believe it.  (Laughter.)  He’s — he said — (laughter).  I used that word once, and nobody has let me forget it, right?  (Laughter.)\nMany of these agents are themselves immigrants or the children of immigrants.  And they’re incredible people — extraordinary patriots who uphold our laws and safeguard our communities.\nWe’re honored to have with us one of our finest: Patrol Agent Jose Avina.  (Applause.)  And, Jose, if you could come up.  Come on up, Jose.  Say a few words.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nAGENT AVINA:  Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, for inviting my family and I.  We’re grateful and honored to be here with you tonight, celebrating our Hispanic Heritage Month with these amazing people here.\nI want to praise God for this opportunity to salute the brave men and women of the United States Border Patrol — (applause) — who are out there working tirelessly, keeping America safe.\nAs chaplains, we have the honor to be by the side of agents’ families who are injured, who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.  We pray for them.  We walk with them through their journey of grief.  And we, step by step, continue with their lives.\nWe have the honor to be with those agents whose children are battling cancer, like the Reyna family.  The opportunity to accompany the death of a spouse, a parent, or a child — like the Gomez and Morales family — I had the honor to serve with both of these families at Police Week.\nI have the daily privilege of working with some of the most compassionate men and women who render aid to the injured, rescue people who have been walking for days or were drowning.  These agents who volunteer after — as coaches, mentors in our communities.\nFinally, I want to thank my parents: my mother, who worked so hard after my dad was injured and could no longer work.  She’s an example of a tough, hardworking Latina who never gives up.  (Applause.)\nI also want to thank my beautiful wife, Amy; my daughter, Brianna; and my two babies, Jose-Luis and Bella, for always supporting me and allowing me to serve country as a Border Patrol agent and as a chaplain.\nTo my brothers and sisters in green, keep the great work honor first.  “Honor first.”  Y Dios la bendiga, President Trump. (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Wow.  Jose, you come from an incredible group of people, I’ll tell you what.  They’re brave, they’re strong, they love our country.  We appreciate the work you do.  And I don’t think anyone how much we appreciate it.  You don’t get the credit you deserve, but the people appreciate it, more than anybody would know.  (Applause.)\nAnd I want you to know that we will always stand with the heroes of Border Patrol, ICE, and all of law enforcement.  They have done just incredible work.\nTo ensure a safe and prosperous future, we also are advancing the cause of human liberty in our hemisphere.  We are also, by the way, advancing the cause of religious liberty.  (Applause.)  Right?  We just talked about that at the United Nations.\nWe’ve confronted the corrupt communist dictatorship in Cuba, cancelling — (applause) — cancelling the last administration’s one-sided deal with the Castro regime.  It was a — just another bad deal.  Very one-sided.  Very unfair to the United States.\nWe’re making good deals now for the United States.  It’s about time.  Our deal with China, our deal with so many — they’re all coming along very, very nicely.  A little patience — to make them great, you need a little patience.\nOur farmers, by the way, have been incredible.  They’ve been incredible.  And now China is back buying again.  They’re buying a lot of our agricultural products.  A lot of things are happening.\nThe United States and our partners have also built a historic coalition of 55 countries dedicated to the future of democracy for the people of Venezuela.  Right?  (Applause.)  Great people.\nAnd this evening, we are proud to welcome ambassadors from many nations taking part in this incredible coalition.  Please put up your hands.  A lot of ambassadors.  We have some really great, great people.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Great people.  A lot of very, very terrific, patriotic people.  They love their country.  They love our country.  It’s all working out really well.  And the relationships have rarely been better, and probably never been better.\nOn behalf of the American people, we want to thank you all, and thank you all for being here.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\nAnd we will not allow the horrors of socialism and communism to be repeated in this century.\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nTHE PRESIDENT:  America stands with the brave people of Cuba, and Nicaragua, and Venezuela — (applause) — in their righteous struggle for freedom.  Someday soon, the Western Hemisphere will be the first fully-free hemisphere in human history.  Did you know that?  Human history.  (Applause.)  It’s going to happen.\nHope it happens during my term — let’s say over the next 16, 18, maybe 20 years.  (Laughter and applause.)  We have just driven the media crazy with that.  (Laughter.)\nIn this noble quest, we know that our cherished Hispanic American citizens are among the fiercest defenders of our shared American values.  Together, we believe in freedom, we believe in justice, we believe in the rule of law, we trust in God, and we cherish the dignity of every human life.  (Applause.)\nThis evening, we are grateful to be joined by Martha Avila, the President of the Heartbeat of Miami Medical Clinics — doing an incredible job.  (Applause.)\nMartha has helped thousands of mothers choose life.  Martha, please come up and say a few words.  Let us know about the great job you’ve done.  I already know, but they don’t.  (Applause.)\nMS. AVILA:  My name is Martha Avila, president and co-founder of Heartbeat of Miami Pregnancy Health Medical Clinics.  Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, thank you for the honor of being here.\nI am a Cuban American, and it saddens me that Cuban Americans and African Americans, even though we’re a minority, we — I’m sorry, Hispanics and African Americans are the minority, yet we form the majority of abortions in our country.  One out of two pregnancies of African Americans ends up in abortion, and one out of three Hispanic pregnancies ends up in abortion.  And that saddens me.\nAnd on behalf of Heartbeat of Miami and the pro-life movement, we want to thank you for what to you do for life.  (Applause.)  Our President does stand for life — life of the unborn and all lives.\nAnd I just want to thank you for that, Mr. President.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Martha.  That’s beautiful.\nMS. AVILA:  We — over 3,000 pregnancy clinics throughout the nation, with very limited resources — are doing this labor of love for those that don’t know what to do.  They’re confused.  They don’t have a way out, and they think that abortion is the only solution.  Yet, we offer them the opportunity to parent their babies, and the opportunity of a plan of adoption.  That is what we do.\nSo pregnancy clinics are good for America.  And one day, abortion will be unthinkable — unthinkable in our country.  So, God bless you all.  God bless you both.  Thank you so much.  (Applause.)\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Martha.  Great job.\nWell, thank you very much, Martha.  And every day, millions of Hispanic Americans like Martha are making tremendous contributions, achieving extraordinary breakthroughs, and enriching every corner of this incredible country of ours.\nThere is no part of American society you have not made better — Hispanic Americans.  There is no aspect of American life you have not made stronger.  And I know that I speak for all Americans when I say that we could not be prouder of our Hispanic American community than we are today.  (Applause.)\nSo to all of you here today: On behalf of Mike and myself and the Cabinet — this is a great Cabinet that we have, and I want to thank them for being here.  But I want to thank you for your devotion to your country.  Thank you for your contribution to our culture.  And thank you for helping make America greater than ever before.  It is greater than ever before.  Remember that.  (Applause.)\nGod bless you all.  And God Bless America.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.\nAUDIENCE:  Four more years!  Four more years!  Four more years!\nEND\n7:28 P.M.\n",

        "text": "Community Hospital EastIndianapolis, Indiana\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you all for being here.  And I’m especially grateful to the distinguished leaders in healthcare, drug abuse and prevention in this state, as well as some great friends and a great colleague from our nation’s capital.\nIt’s great to be back home in Indiana.  We’ve had a great couple of days.  I was yesterday on the east side of Indianapolis, talking about creating jobs with the largest new trade deal in American history.\nI had a chance to stop by an elementary school in my hometown because they invited me earlier today.  A third grade class at Southside Elementary asked me to come in, and we’ve kind of been pen pals for a while.  And that was a great thrill.\nI stopped by to see our troops at Camp Atterbury, who are preparing to deploy.\nBut I have to tell you, it is a joy for me to be back here at the NeuroDiagnostic Institute, which is an extraordinary statement about Indiana’s leadership in the whole area of mental health and also in combatting opioid abuse and addiction.\nI specifically want to thank the Surgeon General of the United States — my friend, Dr. Jerome Adams — for being here and for his tremendous work on combatting opioid abuse and addiction.\nWe are encouraged that, nationwide, in the last year we’ve seen a 5 percent reduction in overdose deaths from opioid abuse.  And it is a beginning of progress, but one that our administration and I know Dr. Adams is absolutely determined to continue to build on that.  But we’re grateful that you’d be here with us, and thank you for your service to the country.\nI’m also grateful to be joined by a former colleague of mine when I had my last job in this state.  Dr. Jennifer Sullivan is now the head of Indiana Family and Social Services.  And this NeuroDiagnostic Institute is a project of the state of Indiana, and Community East really represents the very best of a public and private partnership.  And, Dr. Sullivan, I want to thank you for your great leadership in helping to bring it about.\nAlso, I want to congratulate Dr. Jerry Sheward for his great work here.  He’s the superintendent and the chief medical officer here at NDI, and, I think as of this spring, stood up this extraordinary institution, which is, in fact, the first mental health hospital constructed in the state of Indiana in a half a century.\nAnd it was my great privilege to break ground at this site in my last year as Governor of the state of Indiana.  And to be back here, Dr. Sheward and Dr. Sullivan, and to see this magnificent building, which is already meeting the needs of patients, is a great tribute to your efforts, to your leadership, and to the leadership the state of Indiana has brought to this project.\nI’m grateful, as a Vice President of the United States, to see a state leading on a renewed commitment to mental health.  But I’m also proud, as a Hoosier, to see the state of Indiana really creating a model for other communities and other states around the nation to address the challenges that we face from not only drug abuse and addiction, but also the challenges that mental health pose to public safety.  And I want to speak about that in our roundtable today.\nI want to extend to you the gratitude and the greetings of the President of the United States.  I told President Trump that I would be here.  And I can assure you, as we can have been confronting this crisis of opioid abuse and addiction since early in this administration, and as we have been dealing as a nation with unspeakable acts of violence, most recently in Texas and in Ohio, that there is at least evidence — are driven by individuals with deep mental illness.\nThis example in Indiana — of the state of Indiana making a commitment to expand facilities here — really represents a model for the nation.  And the President and I have talked about it frequently.  And, Bryan Mills, I want to commend you and Community Hospital for really partnering with the state of Indiana to make this a reality.\nI was — I was mentioning the fact that we’ve seen a 5 percent reduction in opioid overdoses nationwide.  But if the statistics hold, Indiana is looking at roughly a 12 percent reduction in deaths from opioid overdoses.  And that is a tribute to Governor Eric Holcomb, to this administration’s commitment to combatting opioid abuse and addiction, to strong law enforcement efforts, but it’s also a tribute to the healthcare community in this state.  And so I want to extend to you our gratitude.\nIt’s amazing to think a reduction in overdoses — the number of lives that are saved in this state and around this country.  And I just want to assure you that as we talk about expanding mental health services here in the state of Indiana, I’m going to be taking this back before the end of the day to meet with the President and share with him what Indiana has been able to do here and our determination to work with Congress in a bipartisan way to address the scourge of opioid abuse and addiction, to address the needs of mental health in this country, with national solutions.\nThe President truly believes that, in the wake of mass shootings that not only beset Texas and Ohio, but in our tenure, Sutherland Springs, Texas, and Las Vegas, and other days that just broke the heart of the American people — we believe part of the answer is strong law enforcement; part of the answer is prevention.  But we also believe — the President and I believe strongly that part of the answer is a renewed commitment to mental health in the United States.  And I’m incredibly proud that Indiana is leading the way.\nAnd with the construction of this beautiful NeuroDiagnostic Institute — the first mental health hospital constructed in the state of Indiana in 50 years — I want to congratulate each of you on really providing a model for other states around the country and an inspiration to leaders in our nation’s capital to do more in the area of mental health.\nSo, thank you very much.  And, Dr. Adams, thank you again for being here.\nEND\n",

about 85 military police preparing to deploy into Afghanistan; the engineers to Kuwait.  But each one of you has your own personal story.  And I was particularly moved, as the son of a combat veteran and the father of a United States Marine, to know that there is a father-son unit getting ready to deploy.  And I don’t know — I got to find out from somebody if that’s ever happened before in the history of the Indiana National Guard.  But it just underscores the commitment of families in this state to our national defense.\nSo would you join me in congratulating and thanking First Sergeant Brian Schultheis and Lieutenant Brett Schultheis?  Where are you guys?  Put your hands in the air.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  I know how proud you are, and I know how nervous you are going downrange with your dad.  I appreciate both of you, and I appreciate your family.  And it really is amazing to see you all here today.\nAs I mentioned, it was probably one of the greatest honors of my life when I was Commander-in-Chief of the Indiana National Guard as your governor.  Thirteen thousand men and women.  It’s amazing to think Indiana is not the seventh-largest state in America, but we boast the seventh-largest National Guard in this country.  And that says an awful lot about families in this state and the commitment to providing for the common defense.\nAnd so I just wanted to come by and really say two things.  First and foremost, thank you for your service.  Thank you for stepping up for Indiana and for America.\nAnd secondly, on behalf of your Commander-in-Chief, I just encourage you: Take the opportunity to be ready, which is the motto of Camp Atterbury and has been for decades.  Use this time of training to sharpen yourselves and be prepared to deploy and bring real excellence and professionalism to this effort.  Be vigilant.  Respect the unified chain of command.  Trust your superiors.  Trust your orders.  Mind your people and mind your mission.  And know that the American people are counting on you, because we know we can.\nYou know, I stand before you today, and the last thing I would say to each one of you is, from the bottom of my heart — is just: Thank you.  Thank you for stepping forward in this all-volunteer military.  Thank you for being the citizen soldiers that the National Guard are here in Indiana and all across America.\nKnow that you go with the confidence of you Commander-in-Chief.  Know that you go with the gratitude of the people of Indiana and this nation.  But also know that you go with the prayers of people all across this state.  And be assured of that as you prepare for deployment, as you go downrange, that you will be carried by the prayers of the people of Indiana and the people of this country.\nWe will pray every day that no harm would befall you, no danger would come near you, and that you would do your job protecting this nation and return home safe to your families.  That, we will pray.\nSo thank you very much.  God bless the Indiana National Guard.  God bless the Hoosier State.  And God bless America.  It’s great to be home.

EDT\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Well, hello, Indiana!\nAUDIENCE:  Hello!\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  It is great to be back home again.  Thank you all for coming out on this glorious September day.  And join me in thanking Lieutenant Governor Suzanne Crouch.  What a great leader and a great conservative champion for Indiana.  (Applause.)\nI also want to thank the Labor Department’s Kate O’Scannlain for being with us today, for doing a great job on behalf of working people all across America.  And join me in thanking Linda McMahon and the whole team at America First Policies for bringing us all together today.  (Applause.)\nAnd I always wait to announce the highest ranking official last, so join me in welcoming my mom, Nancy Pence Fritsch, who actually is here from our hometown in Columbus.  Love you, mom.  (Applause.)\nAnd above all, let me thank Chris MacAllister and the more than 100 men and women here at MacAllister Machinery.  This is a great American success story and it’s about to become even more successful for Indiana and the future.  Thank you, Chris.  Thank you, MacAllister.  (Applause.)\nAnd as I get started, allow me to bring greetings from a friend of mine.  I saw him just yesterday, told him I was headed back to the Hoosier State, and I think he sounded just a little bit jealous.  (Laughter).  So let me bring greetings from a man who loves the state of Indiana every bit as much as I do, who the people of Indiana said “yes” to in 2016 and made the 45th President of the United States of America.  I bring greetings from President Donald Trump.  (Applause.)\nAnd please be seated.  It’s great to be with you all.  Thanks for coming out in the sunshine.\nBut I’m here on the President’s behalf because we’ve got an incredible opportunity before us.  You know, one of the things that I learned representing Indiana for years in Washington, D.C., and growing up down in Bartholomew County, and serving as your Governor, is the important role that trade plays in the life of the state of Indiana.  You know, in the Hoosier State, we do two things well: We make things and we grow things, and then we sell them to the world.\nAnd as I stand before you today, we have before the Congress what will be the largest trade deal in American history.  And I came to Indiana to say it’s time for Congress to pass the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and pass it this year.  (Applause.)\nSo we’re going to talk about trade today.  We’re going to talk about a great opportunity for Hoosier workers and Hoosier businesses.  But before that, let me just take a minute to reflect on the progress that we’ve made because of the confidence the people of Indiana placed in this President and this team now just a better part of three years ago.  It’s amazing for me to think all that time has already passed.\nBut I’ve got to tell you, when I think of the last two and a half years, there’s only one way I can describe it.  It’s been two and a half years of action, two and a half years of results, two and a half years of promises made and promises kept.  And we’re just getting started, Indiana.\nWhile many Democrats have spent the last two and a half years, I think there’s only one way you can describe it, my fellow Hoosiers: I think it’s been two and a half years of action.  It’s been two and a half years of results.  (Applause.)  It’s been two and a half years of promises made and promises kept.  And we’re just getting started Indiana.  (Applause.)\nIt’s really why I’m here today.  And the truth is, while we’re watching our nation’s capital — even today we see many Democrats who spent the last two and a half years on baseless accusations and they keep trying to overturn the will of the American people in the last presidential election — I’m here to make you a promise: Whatever the Democrats and their allies want to spend their time on, President Donald Trump and I are going to stay focused on the issues that matter most to you — (applause) — a strong national defense, secure borders, safe streets, and jobs, jobs, jobs.  (Applause.)  And that’s exactly what we’ve been doing.\nI mean, if you think about the last two and a half years, it’s really remarkable.  I mean, this President promised to revive the American economy.  And right out of the gate — right out of the gate, we went to work with strong conservative voices representing Indiana on Capitol Hill.\nIn our first two years, this President signed the largest tax cuts and tax reform in American history.  We signed more bills cutting federal red tape than any administration in American history.  And we’ve unleashed American energy.\nAnd this year, America is the leading producer of oil and natural gas on Earth.  (Applause.)  In fact — I don’t know if you heard this — next year, for the first time in 75 years, America will be a net exporter of energy to the world.  We are on the road to energy independence, America.  (Applause.)\nAnd in addition to tax cuts and rolling back regulation and unleashing American energy, this President also promised to stand for free and fair and reciprocal trade that puts American jobs and American workers first.  And we’ve been doing that since day one.  The results of all of that have really been remarkable.\nAs I stand before you today in this September of 2019, since Election Day 2016, businesses just like this one — businesses large and small across America — have created 6.3 million new jobs, including 79,000 jobs right here in the Hoosier State.  (Applause.)\nUnemployment has hit a 50-year low, and unemployment here in the state of Indiana is even lower, at 3.4 percent.\nNationwide, we have the lowest unemployment numbers ever recorded for African Americans and Hispanic Americans.  And the most exciting thing to the President and me is to see that the American Dream is working again for every American.  This economy is booming and working for everybody.  (Applause.)\n(Audience interruption.)\nAUDIENCE:  Booo —\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Let me say it again: This economy is working for every American.  (Applause.)  It’s true.  Even for people who don’t agree with us.  (Laughter.)  It’s still working.  It’s incredible.\nAnd, you know, for proof of that, you don’t have to look any further than manufacturing.  And, you know, manufacturing has made an incredible comeback in the last two and a half years, which is a real contrast from the last administration.\nI mean, I remember, in the summer of 2016, the last President — who had overseen the loss of 200,000 manufacturing jobs in this country, and said we basically were never going to get them back.  You remember that?  That’s right.  The “magic wand.”  I mean, the last President actually asked the question; he said, “What magic wand do you have to bring back manufacturing jobs?”  Well, you all know we didn’t need a magic wand; we just needed President Donald Trump in the White House.  (Applause.)\nIn fact, after the last administration lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs, now there are — in fact, there are more manufacturing job openings than at any time in the last decade.  And, in 2018, among — we saw the highest optimism ever among manufacturers all across this country.  And instead of losing 200,000 manufacturing jobs, 500,000 jobs have come roaring back across Indiana and across America.  (Applause.)  In fact, 17,000 manufacturing jobs have come right here to the Hoosier State.\nAnd for working men and women gathered here and looking on: You know, it’s not just been about more jobs.  It’s been about better jobs.  I mean, since President Trump took office, the average American household has seen their disposable income go up by $5,000 a year.  And wages are rising at the fastest pace that they have in more than a decade.  And I think what’s most exciting to the President and me: Wages are rising most rapidly among blue-collar, working-class Americans.  The forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more.  (Applause.)\nAnd these results didn’t just happen.  They happened because of the policies that this President put into place.  And frankly, they happened because Indiana and America have the greatest workers and the greatest businesses in the world.  (Applause.)  You give Americans a chance to compete and excel, and they seize it every single time.\nThe truth is, those numbers tell the tale.  Under this President, a rising tide is lifting all boats — just like so many companies that you see right now across the state of Indiana, and just like MacAllister Machinery thriving right here in central Indiana.\nYou know, I’ve been pleased to hear that, under the President’s leadership and our administration — Chris just told me — that MacAllister’s sales are up, and revenues are breaking records.  Congratulations, Chris.  (Applause.)\nYou know, I grew up just down the road in Columbus, and, you know, I really am amazed and deeply grateful for what the MacAllister family has been able to accomplish for central Indiana, and the contributions that they’ve made.\nThis company is a great American success story.  And it’s a story about the success of the American Dream.  I’m told it all started back in 1945, when Chris’s grandfather became the exclusive Caterpillar dealer for 68 Indiana counties.  And in the seven decades since, this company has grown.  It’s been not only a pillar of its industry, but it’s been a pillar of this community, contributing to our state capital, contributing to the life of this state in countless ways.\nMacAllister now has 26 facilities in Indiana.  And, in 2011, I’m told that you expanded next door into the Wolverine State, when you purchased Michigan Cat.  Now you’ve created more than 1,100 jobs here in Indiana and just about as many in Michigan.  That is a company that is on a roll.  Congratulations, Chris.  (Applause.)\nBut, you know, for all the MacAllister team here — and Chris would be the first to say — that this company’s steady growth — it’s a testament to policies that have given MacAllister the chance to grow and expand.  But it’s mostly a testament to all of you — to your work ethic, to your integrity, the quality of people that make this company work.\nLike I learned today about a proud Hoosier from Plainfield, Indiana, who is a part of this company.  He also served our country in the United States Army.  He was stationed outside Saigon during the Vietnam War.  But after he transitioned back to civilian life, he actually joined MacAllister.  He started as a truck mechanic, and he’s worked his way up, all the way to being a facilities engineer.\nAnd this year, he marks his 40th year with MacAllister Machinery.  Where are you, Mike Hensilwood?  Take a bow, will you?  Great job.  And thank you for your service, Mike.  (Applause.)  I’m proud of you.  Great job.\nMike’s really emblematic, I know, of all of you.  He’s also emblematic of the vi- — visionary leadership of this great company.  So let me take a moment — let me take a moment to recognize one other MacAllister.  He’s a man who I can say has been a friend of mine for almost 40 years — really kind of painful for me to say that.  I marked my 60th year, and this is a man that’s been in my life and been an encouragement to me throughout all of that time.  In, fact, I scarcely believe that I would be where I am today if it wasn’t for the man that I want to mention.\nHe really is considered, by many, as one of the greatest business leaders that Indianapolis has ever known.  But he’s more proud of that fact that he was a proud veteran of the Army Air Corps.  To know him is to know a man who believes in America.  He’s a Renaissance man if there ever there was one in the Hoosier State.  And he’s a man of deep faith — deep faith in this country and deep faith in God.\nIn fact, back when I was your governor, I gave him the highest award that’s afforded to any citizen of the state of Indiana, and it was just a small token of the admiration that the city and the state feels for P.E. MacAllister.  Would you all join me in showing our appreciation for a truly remarkable Hoosier?  (Applause.)  Still working every day and getting a paycheck after 74 years on the job.  Thank you, P.E.  A truly amazing American and a great friend.\nBut, you know, I know that P.E. would be the first one to say that Mike and the others that are here gathered with us today are really the reason that this company works.  And I know he’d be especially proud, as a veteran of our armed forces, to point out that Mike isn’t the only one in this company that’s worn the uniform of the United States.  In fact, I’m told that there are veterans here today, serving at MacAllister Machinery, who served in all the branches of our armed forces.\nSo if you’re able, if you’re a veteran of our armed forces today or in active duty, would you just mind standing up?  Stand up and let us thank you one more time for all you’ve done for our country and our freedom.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you for your service.\nYou know, Hoosiers like Mike and P.E. and these veterans that we just saw and all the team here show that MacAllister Machinery is a great company.  This is a great state.  And, frankly, we just have the — we have the best people in the world.  And I believe, as President Trump does, that as long as we have a level playing field, American workers can compete and win with any workers in any businesses in the world.  (Applause.)\nAnd that’s why we’ve been fighting for that.  That’s why, since the first day of this administration, President Trump and I have been working to hold our trading partners accountable, to open up foreign markets across the globe, to level the playing field — what the President likes to say, is for “free, fair, and reciprocal trade.”\nThat “reciprocal” word is one that he uses most often, and it basically says: If you’re going to have access to the freest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world, we’d like the same access to your economy and to your consumers.\nWe’ve been busy from the first days of this administration.  President Trump renegotiated our trade agreement with South Korea.  Just yesterday, in New York City, at the U.N., the President announced another trade agreement, this time with Japan, that’s going to open up their market to $7 billion more in American agriculture.  That’s a win for Indiana, and it’s a win for America.  (Applause.)\nAnd after years of massive trade deficits and intellectual property theft, President Donald Trump put China on notice that the era of economic surrender is over.  (Applause.)  We’re standing strong.\nBut what brings me here today, as I said at the start, is that this President also drove a hard bargain, and he negotiated what will be the largest trade deal in American history.  We call it the “USMCA” — the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.  And I came home to ask my fellow Hoosiers for your help in getting this thing done and getting it done this year.\nAnd it’s going to make a huge difference.   I mean, according to the International Trade Commission, the USMCA will add more than $68 billion to our economy.  And it’s projected to add more than 175,000 jobs just in the early going, once it passes — including, we’re projecting, about 50,000 more manufacturing jobs.\nAnd, again, we’re not just creating more jobs, but better jobs.  The International Trade Commission tells us that, under the USMCA, American manufacturing workers are going to get another raise, on top of the raise they’ve already received at record levels under President Trump.  The USMCA is a win for working Americans.  (Applause.)\nAnd it’s no real surprise, if you think about it.  According to the National Association of Manufacturers, Canada and Mexico purchase one fifth of America’s manufacturing products.  That’s amazing.  And they buy more American products than any of our next 10 trading partners.\nIt isn’t that they live just next door, it’s that they are a critical destination for what we grow and what we make.  In fact, more than 2 million American manufacturing jobs actually depend on trade with Mexico and Canada, including 61,000 jobs right here in the Hoosier State.\nSo Indiana has got a lot to gain from the USMCA.  And as I said before, we do two things well here: We make things and we grow things.  We’ve got customers all around the world who want to buy our products.  We really do.\nIn fact, here’s your numbers.  Last year, Indiana exported 39 billion dollars’ worth of goods supporting more than 180,000 jobs.  And that includes $10 billion in exports just from the Indianapolis area alone.\nAnd I’m proud to say that Indiana is number 12 in the nation in exports overall.  And our exports are growing fast in this state.  In fact, they’ve gone up by nearly half since 2008.  The Indiana economy is growing, and we are selling to the world.  (Applause.)\nBut here’s the hook — here’s the hook: Nearly half of the exports from the state of Indiana go to Canada and Mexico.  That’s what makes this agreement so important.  And it’s really why I came home to talk about it.  In fact, a quarter of all Indiana’s manufacturing companies sell to Canada and Mexico what they make.\nI mean, we’re just — we’re not just the heart of the Heartland, we’re not just the crossroads of America, we are situated between Canada and Mexico on major transportation arteries that Indiana businesses have taken tremendous advantage of over the years.  And so, for Indiana, for the manufacturing industry, and for America, we’ve got to get the USMCA done and we’ve got to get it done this year.  (Applause.)\nBecause for all of the progress that I was just talking about earlier in our economy and advancing the interest of America at home and abroad, that’s just what this businessman-who-turned-President calls a “good start.”\nThe truth is we need Congress to act, and to act this fall to approve the USMCA.  But to make that happen, we need your help.  Our elected representatives from here in Indiana need to hear from all of you.\nSo I want to encourage each and every one of you to go out and tell the story.  Run into your neighbors and your friends.  Stop people outside your place of worship or outside CVS.  And just say, “You know, I ran into Mike the other day at MacAllister” — (laughter) — “and he was awfully excited about this USMCA thing.”  So I want you to go out there and tell our elected representatives in Washington, D.C., Indiana needs the USMCA.  (Applause.)\nI mean, tell them.  Tell them it’s going to level the playing field.  Tell them this agreement is going to lead to more jobs and more investment in Indiana because it’s the God’s honest truth.  It really is.\nBut the clock is ticking.  So as you go out and reach out to your neighbors and friends, I want you to tell them: Reach out to the people that are going to be making this decision — our members of Congress and our senators.\nBut I can save you a nickel, okay?  You don’t need to call Senator Todd Young or Senator Mike Braun.  They are leading the charge for the USMCA in the United States Senate.  And I couldn’t be more grateful.  (Applause.)\nIn fact, you don’t even need to call any Republicans representing Indiana in our nation’s capital, in the House of Representatives, because they’re all there.  They’re all on board.  They know what trade means to Indiana.  Trade means jobs in Indiana.  That’s what the USMCA is going to mean.\nBut if you have a minute — you know, I always had the view, when I was a member of Congress, that you represent everybody in Indiana and Washington.  So if you have a minute, you might just call Congressman André Carson and Congressman Pete Visclosky and tell them to get off the dime and support the USMCA — (applause) — for Indiana and America.  Seriously.\nI mean, you can tell Congressman Carson — who I served with on Capitol Hill; I served with his grandmother — and tell him the USMCA is a huge win for central Indiana.  I mean, Eli Lilly and Company, which is headquartered right here in Indianapolis, exports nearly $500 million of products to Mexico and Canada every year, supporting about 10,000 jobs right here in central Indiana.\nSo tell Congressman André Carson you want him to put politics aside, put the USMCA on the floor, and pass it for Indiana this year.  (Applause.)  And say it with a smile.\nYou know, the truth is, it was the greatest privilege of my life to represent our hometown in our nation’s capital.  And I can tell you what — I can tell you what: There’s nothing that moves the Congress like the voice of the American people.\nAnd so I’ve been literally travelling across the country and I wanted to come back home again to Indiana to make sure you let your voice be heard.  Because I’m absolutely convinced that if the people of this state and this nation send a clear message to Capitol Hill that we want the USMCA, Congress will get it done.  So let’s go get it done together, okay?  (Applause.)\nSo thanks for coming out today to see me and my mom on this beautiful day.\nI want to thank MacAllister Machinery again for your hospitality and for slowing down your day to make us feel so welcome.  Thank you, Chris.  (Applause.)\nI’m looking forward to saying hi to as many of you as time permits before I slip away.  But, you know, being back home in Indiana is very special.  My wife Karen is off helping raise some money for Riley Children’s Hospital right now.  (Applause.)  And I couldn’t be more proud of her.  Couldn’t be more proud.\nAnd I’ve got a busy couple of days ahead of me before we go back to our nation’s capital that — you know, any time I’m back in Indiana, I just have a heart filled with gratitude.  You know, every opportunity I’ve ever had to serve this nation, whether it be in our nation’s capital or in our statehouse, is because of the confidence, the support, and prayers of the people of Indiana.\nSo let me just say to my fellow Hoosiers: Thank you for privilege of being your Vice President.  It is the greatest honor of my life.  (Applause.)  And I will always be grateful to the people of Indiana for the privilege to serve.  (Applause.)\nThank you.  Thank you for that.\nYou know, these are challenging times in the life of our nation.  It seems like, every day, politicians in Washington and their allies in the media seem to find new ways to divide this country.  But, you know, I’ve always believed that there will always be more that unites us in these United States of America than will ever divide us.\nAnd I’ll make you a promise: Whatever they want to do in Congress to obstruct our agenda, or roll out their latest accusations against the President, or divide this country, President Donald Trump and I are never going to stop fighting for the policies and ideals that have made this country great again.  That’s my promise to everyone in Indiana.  (Applause.)\nAnd I know with your continued support and prayers, with the strong support of Indiana’s delegation, and the Congress of the United States, with the USMCA on the President’s desk and signed, we’re going to make this state and nation more prosperous than you can possibly imagine.\nAnd with President Donald Trump in the White House, and with God’s help, we’re going to keep America great.  (Applause.)\nThanks, everybody.  God bless Indiana.  God bless America.  Let’s go get the USMCA done.\nEND\n1:55 P.M.

        "text": "Joint Base AndrewsPrince George’s County, Maryland\n1:00 P.M. EDT\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.  I just watched a little bit of this on television.  It’s a disgrace to our country.  It’s another witch hunt.  Here we go again.  It’s Adam Schiff and his crew making up stories and sitting there like pious whatever you want to call them.  It’s just a — really, it’s a disgrace.\nIt’s a terrible thing for our country.  They can’t do any work.  They’re frozen — the Democrats.  They’re going to lose the election; they know it.  That’s why they’re doing it.  And it should never be allowed, what’s happened to this President.\nAnd despite that, I think I’ve done just about more than any President in his first two and a half years in office.  If you look, I think you’ll see very few could compete with the things we’ve done for our military, for the economy.  We have the best economy anywhere in the world, by far.  We’ve rebuilt our military.  We’ve done so many things that are so incredible with tax cuts and regulations.  And I have to put up with Adam Schiff on a per- — on an absolutely perfect phone call to the new President of Ukraine.  That was a perfect call.\nBut Adam Schiff doesn’t talk about Joe Biden and his son walking away with millions of dollars from Ukraine, and then millions of dollars from China.  Walking away — in a quick meeting, walking away with millions of dollars.  He doesn’t talk about Joe Biden firing a prosecutor, and if that prosecutor is not fired, he’s not going to give him money from the United States of America.  They don’t talk about that.\nMy call was perfect.  The President, yesterday, of Ukraine said there was no pressure put on him whatsoever.  None whatsoever.  And he said it loud and clear for the press.  What these guys are doing — Democrats — are doing to this country is a disgrace and it shouldn’t be allowed.  There should be a way of stopping it — maybe legally, through the courts.  But they’re going to tie up our country.  We can’t talk about gun regulation.  We can’t talk about anything because, frankly, they’re so tied up.  They’re so screwed up, nothing gets done –except for when I do it.\nI’m using Mexico to protect our border because the Democrats won’t change loopholes and asylum.  When you think of that — and I want to — I’ll tell you, I want to thank Mexico.  Twenty-seven thousand soldiers they have.  But think of how bad that is — think of it — where we use Mexico because the Democrats won’t fix our broken immigration system.  We need their votes.  If we don’t get their votes, we can’t do it.\nAnd the Republicans are all onboard.  They want to fix it, but the Democrats won’t do it.  They don’t want to talk about infrastructure.  They don’t want to talk about lowering drug prices.  They don’t want to talk about anything because they’re fixated on this.  And Nancy Pelosi has been hijacked by the radical left, and everybody knows it.\nThank you.\nEND\n1:03 P.M.

        "text": "InterContinental New York BarclayNew York, New York\n4:28 P.M. EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.\nWell, thank you all for being here.  We’ve had a tremendous three days in New York, at the United Nations.  I want to thank the Secretary-General.  It’s been really incredible what’s been taking place.  And he’s been a fantastic host to a lot of countries.\nThe meetings I had on a bilat, or close, were pretty staggering.  I think we set a new record, but you’ll have to check that out.  The — we met very, very — for pretty extended periods of time, either two and two, one on one, or just about at that level with Pakistan, Poland, New Zealand, Singapore, Egypt, South Korea, United Kingdom, India, Iraq, Argentina, Germany, Brazil, France, Japan, Ukraine, Honduras, El Salvador, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, UAE, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.  Other than that, we weren’t too busy over the last three days.\nAnd, unfortunately, the press doesn’t even cover it.  You know, we have — we’ve made some fantastic deals, like with Japan.  For farmers, we have a tremendous trade deal with Japan.  And that doesn’t get covered because you waste your time on nonsense.\nThe PMI manufacturers’ index has gone substantially up, which was an incredible — Larry Kudlow, wherever you may be — Larry, please stand up.  He just gave me these numbers.  And existing new home sales are through the roof.  Just came out.  Oil prices have gone down ever since the Saudi Arabia incident, and they’ve gone down very substantially.  So, we have plenty of oil.  But those numbers were surprising to you, Larry.  And the extent of the increase.  Is that a correct statement?  So thank you, Larry Kudlow.\nWe think we’ll make this little announcement to you because — important.  You know the so-called whistleblower?  The one that didn’t have any first-class, or first-rate, or second-tier information, from what I understand.  You’ll have to figure that out for yourself.  But I’ve spoken with Leader Kevin McCarthy and the Republicans — many of them — and we were going to do this anyway, but I’ve informed them — all of the House members — that I fully support transparency on the so-called whistleblower information, even though it was supposedly second-hand information, which is sort of interesting.\nAnd other things have come out about the whistleblower that are also maybe even more interesting.  But also insist on transparency from Joe Biden and his son Hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China.  Millions of dollars.  Millions and millions of dollars taken out very rapidly while he was Vice President.  And I think they should have transparency for that.  I’ve informed the Leader about that.\nAnd additionally, I demand transparency from Democrats who went to Ukraine and attempted to force the new President, who I met and is an outstanding person.  I just met a little while ago; some of you were there.  I think he’s going to be outstanding.  He got elected on the basis of corruption.  He wants to end corruption in Ukraine, and I think that’s great.\nBut they went there and they wanted to force the new President to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat.  They threatened him if he didn’t do things.  Now, that’s what they’re accusing me of, but I didn’t do it.  I didn’t threaten anybody.  In fact, the press was asking questions of the President of Ukraine.  And he said, “No pressure.”  I used the word “pressure.”  I think he used the word “push,” but he meant pressure, but it’s the same thing.  No push, no pressure, no nothing.  It’s all a hoax, folks.  It’s all a big hoax.\nAnd the sad thing about this hoax is that we work so hard with all of these countries — and I mean really hard.  This has been — I’ve been up from early in the morning to late in the evening, and meeting with different countries all for the good of our country, and the press doesn’t even cover all of this.  And it’s disappearing — it’s really disappointing also to those countries that are with us and spend so much time with us.\nSo, we want transparency.  We’ve informed Kevin McCarthy about transparency.  And we said, “Vote for it.”  So I think you’ll have close to 100 percent of the Republican votes, I hope.\nAnd it got almost no attention, but in May, CNN reported that Senators Robert Menendez, Richard Durbin, and Patrick Leahy wrote a letter to Ukraine’s Prosecutor General expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were “critical.”  In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake and that if they didn’t do the right thing, they wouldn’t get any assistance.  Gee, doesn’t that sound familiar?  Doesn’t that sound familiar?\nAnd Chris Murphy — who I’ve been dealing with on guns — you know, so nice.  He’s always, “Oh, no, we want to work it out.  We want to work it out.”  But they’re too busy wasting their time on the witch hunt.  So, Senator Chris Murphy literally threatened the President of Ukraine that, if he doesn’t do things right, they won’t have Democrat support in Congress.  So you’re going to look all of this up.\nOne other thing — I’m just going off of certain notes and elements of what we’ve been doing over the last three days, but this just came up a few minutes ago: The “Amazon-Washington Post” just put out a fake article that Acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire — who I’ve gotten to know, and he’s a tough cookie — and I was surprised; I was shocked to hear this — was going to quit, blaming the White House for something that they wouldn’t let him talk openly, freely.  And I was shocked because I know Joe, and he’s tough.  A tough guy.\nAnd I was really surprised to hear he was going to quit.  Before I could even either talk to him or talk to anybody else, he put out a statement — I didn’t speak to Joe yet — but he said, “At no time have I considered resigning my position.”  In other words, the story in the Washington Post was a fake.\n“At no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role on August 16, 2019.  I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now.  I’m committed to leading the intelligence community to address the diverse and complex threats facing our nation.”  That’s from the Acting Director of National Intelligence, a very good man, Joseph Maguire.\nSo we’re having a great period of time.  Our country is the strongest it’s ever been economically.  Our numbers are phenomenal.  Wilbur, thank you.  And Larry.  Everybody.  The numbers are phenomenal.  Our economy is the strongest in the world.  We’re the largest economy in the world.\nHad my opponent won, we would be second right now because China was catching us so rapidly, we would’ve been second by this time.  And unless somebody does a very poor job as President, we’re going to be first for a long way, because we’ve picked up trillions and trillions of dollars in value and worth of our country, and China has lost trillions and trillions of dollars, and millions of jobs, and their supply chain.  And they want to make a deal.\nThis year, America came to the United Nations stronger than we have ever been before: Since my election, the United States has not only brought our economy to a level that we have never seen, the most jobs that we’ve ever had — you know you’ve heard me say it many times — African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, the best unemployment numbers we’ve ever had.  And the most and best employment numbers: 160 million — very close to that number — in jobs.  We’ve never been anywhere close.\nWages are up, and inequality is down.  Something that people don’t like writing about.  But wages are up.  I used to speak during the campaign, and I’d talk about wages where people were making less money three years ago than they were making 21 years, 22 years ago, and they’d have two jobs and three jobs.  When I say “three years ago,” I’m talking into the area sometime prior to the election.  And they were doing very badly.  And now, for the first time in many years, wages are up and employment is up, and unemployment is down.  And it’s a beautiful thing to watch.\nIn a week of active and ambitious diplomacy here at the United Nations, America renewed our friendships.  We advanced our values greatly and made clear to everyone that the United States will always defend our citizens to promote prosperity.\nI met with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, at length, of the United Kingdom, continuing our discussions on a magnificent, new bilateral trade deal.  So we’ll see what happens with respect to Brexit, but I suspect we’ll have a fantastic deal with the UK. It should be much bigger than it has been over the last number of years.  Over the last 20 years, frankly.  It should be a much bigger deal.\nThat’s true with many countries.  We’re going to have much bigger trade deals with a lot of countries that have an opportunity to come.  And they all want to do business with the United States, especially now.\nEarlier today, I stood alongside Prime Minister Abe of Japan — a friend of mine, a great gentleman.  Had a great reelection.  And we signed a terrific new trade deal, which tremendously helps our farmers and ranchers, and technology.  The technology companies are really big beneficiaries.\nWe also held very productive conversations with leaders of Pakistan, India.  And many other nations are achieving stronger ties of fair and reciprocal trade.  And with respect to Pakistan and India, we talked about Kashmir.  And whatever help I can be, I said — I offered, whether it’s arbitration or mediation, or whatever it has to be, I’ll do whatever I can.  Because they’re at very serious odds right now, and hopefully that’ll get better.\nYou look at the two gentlemen heading those two countries — two good friends of mine — I said, “Fellas, work it out.  Just work it out.”  Those are two nuclear countries.  They’ve got to work it out.\nThis week, we also made incredible strides on national security with President Duda of Poland.  We signed a joint declaration advancing defense cooperation.  And, crucially, Poland has agreed to put up 100 percent of the money — something I don’t think you’ve ever heard said before.  But they’re going to put up 100 percent of the money, of hosting additional U.S. military personnel that we’ll be taking from various other countries.  We won’t have more over; we’ll have — we’ll be moving them around.\nPoland is building us phenomenal new facilities.  They’re spending everything, and they’re going to really do a job.  But we’ll be moving a few thousand soldiers, and Poland will be paying that for it.\nTogether with Prime Minister Lee of Singapore, I signed an important agreement extending our defense cooperation.  This hasn’t been changed in many years.  Then, yesterday, I met with prospective members of the Middle East Strategic Alliance, which is a group that I know very well; I know all of them.  And through this effort, the nations of the Middle East are taking more responsibility for securing their own future and their own neighborhood.  And they’re also reimbursing us and paying us for a lot of the military work that we incredibly do.\nBut because we’re now independent, energy-wise — we’re energy independent — we have very few boats going over the Middle East.  We used to have them going through the Straits all the time.  And you probably noticed that, every once in a while, they go after somebody else’s.  They haven’t gone after ours yet. If they do, they’ve get big problems.  But we have very few boats going over there.  They were saying the other day, they’ve never attacked an American boat, and I’m not asking for trouble.  But if they do, they know they have far bigger trouble.  But then they said, “But, you know, we don’t see very many American boats over here anymore.”\nThis week also brought extraordinary progress to nations of our own hemisphere.  In recent days, we’ve achieved historic asylum cooperation agreements with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.  We were with El Salvador today.  A great young gentleman became the President.  He’s strong and tough, and he’s taking care of crime.  He was really something today.  I was very impressed with him.  And likewise with Honduras, who we met.  We signed a cooperation agreement with both, and also with Guatemala.\nWe’re working with our partners in Central America to ensure that asylum-seekers can pursue relief as close to their home countries as possible.  That’ll make a tremendous difference at our southern border.\nAnd Mexico — I have to say, President Lopez Obrador has been outstanding — an outstanding partner.  And he’s doing a great job in Mexico.  The cartels are way down, and the numbers — our Secretary is here now — the numbers are way down.  Way, way down.  And we’re doing that without the help of Congress, meaning the Democrats in Congress who won’t give us a single vote to take care of loopholes.\nWe have loopholes that are so horrible, and it would be so easy to fix.  And they know they should be fixed but they don’t want to do because they don’t want to give Trump any credit because it’s all about the election.  That’s all they care about.  They don’t care about our country; they care about the election.\nAnd the sad part is, with all of the tremendous work that we’ve done this weekend — whether it’s Secretary Mnuchin or Secretary Pompeo, who had some outstanding, outstanding meetings — with all of this tremendous work that we’ve done, the press doesn’t even cover it.  And the Democrats did this hoax during the United Nations week.  It was perfect.  Because this way, it takes away from these tremendous achievements that we’re taking care of doing, that we’re involved in in New York City, at the United Nations.\nSo that was all planned, like everything else.  It was all planned.  And the witch hunt continues, but they’re getting hit hard in this witch hunt, because when they look at the information, it’s a joke.  Impeachment?  For that?  When you have a wonderful meeting, or you have a wonderful phone conversation?\nI think you should ask.  We actually — you know, that was the second conversation.  I think you should ask for the first conversation also.  I can’t believe they haven’t, although I heard there’s a — there’s a rumor out they want the first conversation.  It was beautiful.  It was just a perfect conversation.\nBut I think you should do that.  I think you should do, and I think you should ask for VP Pence’s conversation because he had a couple conversations also.  I can save you a lot of time.  They’re all perfect.  Nothing was mentioned of any import other than congratulations.  But the word is that they’re going to ask for the first phone conversation.  You can have it anytime you need it.  And also Mike Pence’s conversations, which were, I think, one or two of them.  They were perfect.  They were all perfect.\nIt’s very sad what the Democrats are doing to this country. They’re dividing.  They’re belittling.  They’re demeaning our country.  So many leaders came up to me today and they said, “Sir, what you go through, no President has ever gone through.  And it’s so bad for your country.”  People laugh at the stupidity of what they’ve asked for.  And here we could do asylum.  We could do all of these different things so easily.  We could do asylum quickly.  We could do loopholes; get rid of them.\nInstead, we actually made deals with Mexico and with Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras.  And we’re doing it with them instead of with our Congress, but we’re doing it.  We get it done.\nThe wall is being built, by the way.  It got little coverage.  I went to the border.  It’s going up in New Mexico.  It’s going up in Arizona.  It’s going up in California, believe it or not.  They really wanted that wall in California, in San Diego.  As soon as it was completed, they said, “We don’t want a wall.”  They were begging me for a wall.  I should take it out and move it to another location.\nWe were with the Governor — spoke to him a lot — but the Governor of Texas, Lieutenant Governor of Texas, Attorney General of Texas, the senators of Texas — Cornyn, Ted Cruz.  And we’re building an incredible wall.  That’s going to — number one, it’s going to look great.  It’s going to be virtually impossible to cross unless you’re one hell of a mountain climber.  It’s very tough.  It’s going to be very tough to get people and drugs over those walls, because they’re the real deal.\nI went to the Secretary of Homeland security, and he got all his people together.  I said, “Give me four walls — your optimum.  Every single thing included.”  And they give me 20 percent less, 20 percent less, and 20 percent less — meaning, less cost.  They came back, they said, “This is the wall, sir.  This would be the best.”  We have the panels on top, which are anti-climb panels.  I don’t know if you noticed the steel on top.  We have a different design for a different area, but this anti-climb is very tough.  They’ve — we had people going out and real climbers telling us which is the toughest to climb.  But these are anti-climb panels.  Very tough to get across.\nAnd the wall is going up, many miles a week.  And we hope to have over 400, but maybe as much as 500 miles, which we’ll pretty much do it because you have a lot of natural barriers; you have mountains, you have really rough rivers.  You have some really rough land that you can’t cross very easily.  So they serve as their natural walls.  But we — we’ll have, we think, over 400, but we could even have 500 miles.\nTo combat the malice, corruption of both the Venezuelan and Iranian dictatorships, today I issued proclamations suspending the entry into the United States of senior regime officials and their families.\nAnd further, to promote American values, on Monday I was proud to be the first President in history to host a meeting at the United Nations —\nI’m so surprised; first President for this.  I can’t believe that I’m first.  I spoke to Franklin Graham about that.  I can’t believe it.\n— at the United Nations, on protecting religious freedom and liberty for people around the world.\nWhile some partisans and unelected bureaucrats in Washington may choose to fight every day against the interests and beliefs of the American people, my administration is standing up for the American people like no administration has in many, many years.  You forgot the American people.  You totally forgot the American people.\nThis week, every — every week, I really can say — of my presidency, we’re standing up for American prosperity, American security, and the American way of life.  And together, with our friends and partners, we’re building a more peaceful, prosperous, and promising future.\nWe have a tremendous relationship now with a lot of nations that are very happy with what’s going on, and that includes in South America, where they’ve been so helpful, where nobody thought this would be possible.  The relationship with Mexico is an example, or El Salvador, or Honduras, or Guatemala.  Nobody even knew about it.  Yet, we sent them hundreds of millions of dollars, and all we got back was caravans of people pouring in.\nWe had tremendous — we had tremendous — it was terrible.  And we’ve got that stopped, and the countries are now helping us.  And we stopped those payments, by the way.  We don’t pay those countries that money anymore.  But I will tell you, if they’re as good as they seem to be — they’re really doing a job on crime and stopping the wrong people from leaving and coming to the United States — we’ll be helping them a lot with economic development projects and other things.\nSo, with that, we had a tremendous three days.  It was beautiful to see.  Made a lot of new friends.  I read you a list of all the countries I saw pretty much one on one.  And it’s been very busy, but it’s been very, very fruitful.\nSo we could take a couple of questions. I’d love some questions on some of the things that we accomplished at UNGA, instead of the witch hunt — the phony witch hunt questions, which I know that’s what you want to ask because it’s probably better for you, but it’s not better for the country.\nSo maybe we’ll take a few — a few questions.  Please.\nQ    Thank you, Mr. President.  You suggested that you didn’t do anything wrong in the course of your conversations with the Ukrainian President.  But can you explain to the American people why it is appropriate for an American President to ask a foreign leader for information about a political rival, and what you would have said if you discovered that Barack Obama perhaps had asked a foreign leader for information about you before your campaign for the presidency?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.  Well, that’s what he did, isn’t it, really?  When you think about it.\nLook, that whole witch hunt was started, and hopefully that’ll all come out.  But there’s been some fantastic books written that just came out — whether you will look at Gregg Jarrett, or McCarthy’s book that just — just came out recently, and so many other books.  And a lot of books are coming out. When you start reading those books, you see what they did to us.  What they’ve done to this country is a disgrace.  They’ve hurt this country very badly.  And no other President should have to go through what I’ve gone through.\nThe President — the new President of Ukraine is looking to stop corruption.  There’s a lot of corruption going on, and there was corruption.  I just told you about senators that threatened him with votes and no money coming into Ukraine if they do things.  That’s really what people are trying to say that I did, but the only difference is I didn’t do it.  You take a look at that call; it was perfect.  I didn’t do it.  There was no quid pro quo, but there was with Biden and there was with these senators.  And they threatened.  They said, “You do this, you do that.  We’re not going to give you votes.”  That’s — that’s the real deal.\nSo we have an honest group of people that have been maligned.  And, you know, it’s — a lot of people say I’ll do even better.  I’m very happy.  Yesterday, I guess we had a 53 poll, and a lot of people say add 10 points to anything.  Anybody voting for Trump, you can add — anytime you get a poll, you can add 10 points or 7 points or 6 points.  Take it any way you want.  But I don’t know if I consider that to be a compliment, but in one way it is a compliment.\nAnd I guess that’s what happened in the last election: Far more people came to vote than anybody thought possible.\nQ    So why should the American people then be comfortable with an American President asking a foreign leader for information about an American citizen?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think you can look at your senators and you can look at Biden, and you can look at all these other people.  But what we’re looking for is corruption.  An investigation started, called the “Russian witch hunt,” affectionately.  And it was a total phony scam.  It was set up by people within the government to try and stop somebody from getting elected.\nAnd after that person — namely, me — won, and convincingly won at 306 to 223 in the Electoral College — which, by the way, when you run a race, if you’re running electoral — you know, if you go by the College, Electoral College, that’s a much different race than running popular vote.  And it’s like the hundred-yard dash or the mile.  You train differently.\nAnd I can’t help it that my opponent didn’t go to Wisconsin and should have gone much more to Michigan and Pennsylvania and other places.  But that’s the way it is.  We won election, convincingly.  Convincingly.  And then you had the text message on, “Well, if she doesn’t win, we’ve got an insurance policy.” How bad was that?  You know the insurance policy?  That’s sort of what has been taking place over the last number of years — the insurance policy.\nNo, there are a lot of very dishonest people.  We’re the ones that played it straight.  And you know what?  The millions of people out there that are looking at what’s going on — those people understand it.  They see it.  And they think it’s disgusting.  And our people are being hurt, and our country is being hurt.\nWhen Nancy Pelosi allows her position to be taken over by radical far-left socialists, or worse, that’s pretty bad.  That’s pretty bad — especially when the senators and all of these other people have actually done what they’re accusing me of doing, which I didn’t do.\nI’m going to have Mike Pompeo say a couple of words.  I’m going to have Steve Mnuchin say a couple of words.  And then we’ll do a couple of more questions.\nSECRETARY POMPEO:  Mr. President, I thought I’d start by talking about Iran.  We had a productive week.  We saw the Europeans take a position with respect to the attacks that took place in Saudi Arabia, making clear this was Iran, just as President Trump and I had been saying, and have now joined us in saying that the existing JCPOA framework is not going to work, it’s not going to solve the world’s problems, it’s not going to create Middle East stability.\nThen we had a good set of meetings with our Middle East allies as well.  The President joined for a meeting of the GCC where we talked again about how we can help deter.  We want peace.  We want a peaceful resolution with the Islamic Republic of Iran.  We’re hoping we can get that way.  In the end, it’ll be up to the Iranians to make that decision, whether they’ll choose violence and hate — and the President said in his speech yesterday to the General Assembly — if their bloodthirst will continue.\nWe hope that’s the (inaudible).  We hope we can get the opportunity to negotiate with them and get an outcome that’s good for both of them, for the United States, to make sure that they never have a nuclear weapon and that they can’t foment their terror with ballistic missiles and in the way they have all around the world.  And I think we made real progress uniting the world on that here over these past few days.  Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.\nSECRETARY MNUCHIN:  As Secretary Pompeo said on Iran, we had very good discussions with all of our allies about the sanctions program, which is the maximum pressure, and unity on the sanctions program.  The Europeans made it very clear they would not do anything without our consent.\nAnd then, on the economic front, we had the entire economic team here for all the meetings: Secretary Ross, Larry Kudlow; Ambassador Lighthizer just left to go back to D.C.  He’s working hard on trying to get USMCA passed.  But we had a lot of productive discussions.  The Japanese trade deal and a lot of discussions on investing in the U.S., more jobs in the U.S., and more trade.  Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Okay.  Go ahead, please.\nQ    Thank you.  Kristina Partsinevelos, Fox Business.  I want to focus on markets, because I’ll leave it to everybody else to talk about impeachment.  Markets reacted positively after you spoke about China, and that it would happen sooner than — rather than unexpectedly.\nYet, you have the Foreign Minister of China saying that they have no intention of, you know, unseating the United States.  And yet, they’re investing heavily in infrastructure and military.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Not anymore, maybe.\nQ    But what — what is different this time, though?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And maybe they just say that, Kristina.\nQ    What is different this time, though?  The fact that you’re saying it’s progressing.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Oh, I just think it’s progressing.  I think they want to make a deal.  They’re losing their supply chain.  You know, it’s getting killed.\nQ    Do you have something specific?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don’t want to say that.  But I can tell you that these two men — and, in this case, more specifically, Steve, we’re having some very good conversations.\nAnd I guess it’s next week that a group is coming in and the week after.  So we have a lot of — we have a lot of talks going on, and also by telephone.\nThey want to make a deal.  And you know why they want to make a deal?  Because they’re losing their jobs, and because their supply chain is going to hell.  And companies are moving out of China, and they’re moving to lots of other places, including the United States.  And that’s not good; that’s far worse than they thought.\nAnd, by the way, in the meantime, we’re taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs.  We’re taking in tremendous numbers in tariffs.  And we’re helping our farmers who got targeted.  Now, by the way, China is starting to buy our agricultural product again.  They’re starting to go with the beef and all of the different things — pork.  Very big on pork.\nBut if you look and if you see — and they actually put out, I think, a statement.  But they’re starting, very heavy, to buy our ag again.  No, they want to make a deal.  And they should want to make a deal.  The question is: Do we want to make a deal?\nQ   If USMCA doesn’t pass through Congress, is that it for NAFTA?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, that would be a shame.  Well, I don’t want to answer that question, but you know how I feel about NAFTA.  I think NAFTA is the worst trade deal ever made, although I also happen to think World Trade Organization was not one of the greats.  Not one of the greats.  That was the creation of China, which went like a rocket ship from the day they signed.  It was — it was terrible.\nBut, no, we’re going to find out.  That’s going to be a very interesting question, with Nancy and Chuck and all of these people focusing on the witch hunt because they can’t beat us at the ballot.  They can’t beat us at the ballot.  And they’re not going to win the presidential.  We’re having great polls.  We have internal polls that are — Ohio, Iowa.  Pennsylvania is looking good.  North Carolina.\nWe just won two races that a lot of people — we thought we were going to lose both of those races.  One was down 17 points three weeks before the race, and he ended up winning by a substantial margin — by a substantial margin.  And — Dan Bishop.\nAnd then we had a second race, as you know, and he was up one or two points and ended up winning by — what was it?  Twenty-five points or some incredible — I’ll ask you folks because I don’t want to be inaccurate.  Otherwise, I’ll have a front-page story: “We have breaking news.  Trump exaggerated.”\nBut he won by many, many points.  And he was leading by maybe two, maybe three, but he won by — in the twenties.  So it’s — it’s been — so we’re looking great in North Carolina, looking great in Florida.\nAnd you had one or two congressmen Democrats say, “Listen, we can’t beat them at the election, so let’s impeach him.”  Right?  Didn’t you hear — Al Green.  That’s a beauty.  He’s a real beauty, that guy.  But he said, very distinctively, it’s all — it was all over the place.  I don’t know — they’re trying to lose that tape, I guess.\nBut he said, “We can’t…”  Essentially, he said, “We can’t beat him.  Let’s impeach him.”  That’s pretty — that’s pretty dangerous stuff.\nSteve, go ahead.\nQ    Thank you, sir.  You had expressed some concerns about the precedent of releasing the transcript.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.  I don’t like it.\nQ    Why did you go ahead and do it?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Because I was getting such fake news, and I just thought it would be better.  And now they’re asking for the first phone conversation, and I’ll release that too, if it’s important to you.  But they’re asking for — because I had a conversation previous — on a previous election plateau that he had hit.  The — the current president hit a couple of different plateaus.  And I spoke to him, previous to the call that we released, which was a very innocent call — very, very innocent; very nice call.\nAnd as he said, we were — “I wasn’t pushed.  I wasn’t pushed,” meaning pressured.  He wasn’t pressured at all.\nBut I don’t like the concept of releasing calls because when a president or prime minister, or a king or a queen, calls the United States, you don’t like to say, “Gee, we’re going to release your call to the fake-news media, and they’re going to make you look like a fool.”  What happens is, it’s hard to do business that way.  You want to have people feel comfortable.\nSo I hated it, but you folks were saying such lies, such horrible things about a call that was so innocent and so nice.  In fact, Lindsey Graham said to me, when he read it — it was very interesting.  He’s a good man.  He’s a smart man.  He said, “I can’t believe it.  I never knew you could be this, really, nice to a person.”  He said, “I cannot believe it.  You were so nice.  I didn’t think you had that in you to be so nice.”\nI was nice.  I’m nice to a lot of people.  People don’t understand that.  But I was.  But he was shocked that it was such a nice call.  There — he said, “There is nothing here.”  And all fair people say the same thing.\nBut I don’t like the precedent, Steve.  I don’t like it where you’re dealing with heads of state and to think that their call is going to be released.  But I felt that — and, you know, we spoke to Ukraine about it.  Mike actually called up his counterpart, and we spoke to Ukraine about it because we want to — because they could have been — if that they didn’t want us to do it, we would not have done it.\nBut he actually said, “That was a very innocent call.  You can release it all you want.”\nQ    And are you now braced for long impeachment saga?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I thought we won.  I thought it was dead.  It was dead.  The Mueller report — no obstruction, no collusion.  You look at all of the things that happened.\nCorey Lewandowski was fantastic the other day, as a person that they have been tormenting.  You look at all the people that they’ve tormented, all the legal fees.  People came here with bright eyes; they wanted to make life so great for other people.  And they left where they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees that they didn’t have.  And it’s a sad thing.  What these Democrats have done to ruin lives is so sad.\nI’ve seen people with only good intention.  They came to Washington because they wanted to make the United States and the world a better place.  And they went home — they were dark.  They got hit by Mueller’s subpoenas.  I think there were 2,500 subpoenas, or some ridiculous number.  Five hundred people were interviewed, and yet, they don’t interview Joe Biden and his son.\nIf you’re Democrat, you have automatic protection.  That’s years and years of people putting in certain people into positions.  But when you look at all of the — all of the trauma that these fakers, of course — and the press — look, the press is — much of the press is not only fake, it’s corrupt.  These stories they write are corrupt; they’re so wrong.  And they know that.\nYou know, it used to be — I used to get great press until I ran for politics.  I mean, I used to be the king of getting good press.  I was very good at it.  And I got good.  I mean, they covered me well for what — otherwise, I probably wouldn’t be here.\nAnd once I ran, I said, “Boy, this is incredible.”  But if you see the way they treat my family — used to be treated great.  My family worked so hard.  The people that work with me — these people — all of these people, they work so hard.  They’ve done such a good —\nLook, we have the greatest economy we’ve ever had.  We have a military — two and a half trillion dollars.  We’ve rebuilt our military.  You don’t hear the vets complaining.  We got Choice approved.  It couldn’t be approved.\nBut when you see what happened with the viciousness, and when you see little Adam Schiff go out and lie and lie and stand at the mic — smart guy, by the way — stand at the mic and act like he’s so serious.  And then he goes into a room with Nadler, and they must laugh their asses off.  They must laugh their asses off.\nBut it’s so bad for our country.  People have said — Rush Limbaugh — great man; Sean Hannity said it.  A lot of people have said it.  Mark Levin.  They said they don’t know if one man anywhere in the world, with all the men they know — or woman — that could handle what I’ve had to handle.\nAnd I think that’s true, but I handle it.  To me, it’s like putting on a suit.\nAll right, how about one more question?  A question on the economy.  A question on the economy.\nGo ahead.  Go ahead.\nQ    Hi, Mr. President.  VPItv from Venezuela — Caracas, Venezuela.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Good.  Good.  Wow.\nQ    Yeah.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  How are you doing?\nQ    We made it.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  How are you doing over there?\nQ    Pretty bad.  Our situation is pretty bad.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.  I would say “pretty bad.”  Yeah.  Sad.\nQ    Yeah.  But we are fighting.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And it was one of the great countries and one of the richest countries not so long ago — 15 years ago.  It’s incredible.\nQ    But we are going to make it.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Right.  I agree with that.  And we’re helping you.\nQ    Yeah.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  We’re helping you.\nQ    Yeah, I know.  And thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Go ahead.\nQ    I have two questions —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Go ahead.\nQ    — to take advantage of this.  Maduro traveled to Russia and Diosdado Cabello to North Korea — two of the most antagonist nations in the U.S. interests.  What can be done to contain this?  What are they looking for in that country?  And because the special envoy, Mr. Abrams, said that the Russians are willing to negotiate it.  This is one question.\nAnd the other: Mr. President, you say that the socialists is one of the biggest challenges, you said yesterday in the United Nations.  But the region is far from safe.  Maduro is still a dictator, full in power.  (Inaudible) in Argentina and Brazil are on their (inaudible) about the socialist and populist.  Are you worried about it?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I just say that socialism will never happen in the United States.  It can’t happen in the United States.  And Venezuela — unfortunately, I have to use your country as the example of what socialism can do, how it can tear the fabric of a country apart.  Because I know a lot about Venezuela.\nI’ve had many, many friends of mine come from Venezuela.  They live — many in Miami — a certain section of Miami, I won’t mention the name because they’ll say I’m thinking about my business, and I’m not.  But they are fantastic people and they like your President.  They voted overwhelmingly for me.  They like what I’m doing for Venezuela.\nWe have Venezuela very much in our hearts and very much in our sights.  And we’re watching it very carefully.  And you know what I would say?  We’re giving millions and millions of dollars in aid — not that we want to, from the Maduro standpoint, but we have to because, on a humanitarian — people are dying.  They have no food.  They have no water.  They have no nothing.  They’re dying.  No medicine.  Their hospitals are closed or — or don’t even have electricity.  It’s so sad to see.\nLet me just say that we have it under control.  We are watching it very carefully.  And we’re going to be very, very —\nQ    Russia (inaudible) —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  We’re — we’re watching it very carefully, including other countries that may or may not be playing games.  We’re watching it very closely.\nQ    But, you know, if Russia is talking with the USA or Guaidó, what can you tell — about us?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Just put this in the back of your mind: It’s all going to be fine.  We know everything that you said, and it’s all going to be fine.  We’re very much involved.  We very much know what’s going on, and we’re very much involved.  Okay?\nThank you all very much.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.\nEND\n5:10 P.M.

        "text": "InterContinental New York BarclayNew York, New York\n3:24 P.M. EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  It’s a great honor to be with the President of El Salvador.  We’ve had a tremendous success because, two weeks ago, we signed a cooperation agreement, which is a big thing — great for El Salvador, great for the United States.  And we worked very, very well with our people.  And I have great respect for you, and I really appreciate what you’re doing.\nThe President has done an incredible job with MS-13.  He realizes what a threat they are.  And they have been very, very tough, and we all appreciate that.  And thank you very much for the agreement.\nPRESIDENT BUKELE:  Thank you, Mr. President.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Please.\nPRESIDENT BUKELE:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Well, we’re very happy to be here.  It’s an honor to be with the President of the United States and with his team.  It’s — we’re very impressed and — the whole team being here.\nAnd actually, for us, the United States is not only a partner and an ally, but also a friend.  And we’re going to show that friendship — that’s one of the reasons we signed the agreement is because we want to show that friendship to our most important ally, which is the United States.  And for us, this is very, very important.\nAnd looking forward, I mean, we have been a little more than 100 days in office, but we look forward to be working with President Trump for the next five years.  So I think that will be very good for us.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I thought you were going to say longer than that.  (Laughter.)  Tell them a little bit longer, they’ll love that.  That’ll be breaking news.\nPRESIDENT BUKELE:  I’m only going to be — I’m only going to be for five years.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I know.  (Inaudible.) (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT BUKELE:  You would need to talk with — to talk with the next President.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes.\nPRESIDENT BUKELE:  So for — we’re very happy to be here and we’re hoping that this meeting will only strengthen our relationship even more.  And I think it will, because, you know, we’re — President Trump is very nice and cool, and I’m nice and cool, too.  (Laughter.)  So — we both use Twitter a lot, so, you know, we’ll get along.  And we’re very honored.  We’re very honored, Mr. President.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, it’s our honor.  Thank you very much.  And we’re working together very well.  And the relationship has been excellent.\nMr. Secretary, would you like to say something?\nSECRETARY MCALEENAN:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And thank you, President Bukele.  It’s been a tremendous partnership in the first 100 days you’ve had in office, with all of your team: Minister Hill, Minister Rivas, your security minister.  And I really see the advances that you’re making on ending forced migration.  It’s very productive for the region, and we’ll be there alongside supporting you.  Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And I think, importantly, we met with Honduras, as you know, and we also had meetings previous to this, but with Guatemala, and had tremendously successful meetings.  We also signed agreements with them — cooperation agreements.  Some people use different terms, but we use the word “cooperation agreement,” and at the highest strength, and yours also.  And that’s good for all of us.  It’s really good for all of us.\nMexico has been fantastic on the border.  Today we have 27,000 soldiers.  The numbers are way down.  What are the numbers you were just telling me?\nSECRETARY MCALEENAN:  Yeah.  We’re going drop again this month, Mr. President.  It will be an over 60 percent reduction from the peak in May.  And from Central America, it will be closer to 75 or 80 percent reduction.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.  About an 80 percent — I heard that before.  Eighty-one percent.  The catch and release is gone, as of almost now.\nSECRETARY MCALEENAN:  That’s right.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And there won’t be catch and release.  We’re not releasing anybody into the country.  And especially, we focus on the bad ones, but the bad ones get taken out.  We’re removing them from our country.  We’re moving them fast.  And they are the ones that go first.  You might want to discuss that a little bit.\nGo ahead.\nSECRETARY MCALEENAN:  Absolutely.  So we announced the end of the court-mandated catch and release of families from Central America.  And we’ve been able to do that because of our partnerships with the region, like with El Salvador, on streamlining repatriation for those who don’t claim asylum, and working with Mexico through the migrant protection protocol for families if they do claim asylums so that they can get an expedited court hearing.  And that’s been a very productive approach.\nWe reduced the overall flow, and we’re taking profits away from criminal smugglers, and we’re making great progress with our international partners under your leadership.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And Mexico, frankly, is doing a great job, with respect to the cartels, by having 27,000 soldiers on our border.  They’re decimating a lot of the cartels that were just really coming in.  There’s so many people now.  There’s so many bodies and really strong, tough, hardened soldiers there that it’s very hard for the cartels to break through.  And a lot of bad were — if you have a cartel, it has not been a good situation for you.  So Mexico really is doing themselves a big favor, too.\nBut the President of Mexico has been outstanding in working with all of us, really.\nPRESIDENT BUKELE:  Yeah.  (Inaudible.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And we’re very happy.\nThe people that aren’t working with us are the Democrats.  The Democrats in Congress are a disaster.  We could solve so many more problems with the loopholes, which could be done literally in 15 — I always say it — 15, 20 minutes — maybe 30, if we’re a little bit slower.  But we could solve the loophole problem in a short period of time.\nDespite that — and we have asylum also, which we could solve immediately.  But we’ve sort of solved asylum by going through different countries.  Can you believe it?  Where we go to El Salvador, Honduras; we go to Mexico; we go to Guatemala to solve problems of asylum because we can’t go to the United States Congress because the Democrats are playing games.  They don’t have any time to do anything else.  They don’t have time to do gun safety.  They don’t have time to do infrastructure.  They have time to do nothing else.\nI’ll tell you what: A lot of people are very angry at what’s going on.  They view it as — you could never use the word “joke,” because it’s too serious.  But they view it as something that should never take place.  They’re never going to see anything done with this group in Congress — the Democrats.  And that’s why I really think the Republicans will take over the House.  We might even increase in the Senate.  And we’ll keep the presidency and we’ll do something that — like this country has never seen before.\nBut Nancy Pelosi has been taken over by the radical left.  I watched it.  I just find it hard to believe.  But she’s been totally taken over by the radical left.  And she does exactly as they want her to do.  And a lot of her members now are having second thoughts.  They’re saying they’re in a very bad position.  They’re in a very bad position.\nWe were just with the President — the new President of Ukraine — and it was a fantastic meeting.  He said, “No pressure.  No nothing.”  It’s all a hoax.  I call it “the hoax.”  And this is just a continuation of the witch hunt.  And that’s all faded; that’s all gone.  And they had to come up with something else.  The same players — Adam Schiff, Nadler — all the same players.\nBut now Nancy Pelosi was forced into a position that she didn’t want to be in, and unfortunately she wasn’t tough enough to stop it.\nSo thank you very much everybody.  I think we’re going to be doing a news conference in a little while.  And that’ll be the end.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.\nEND\n3:32 P.M.

        "text": "InterContinental New York BarclayNew York, New York\n2:19 P.M. EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, thank you very much, everybody.  We’re with the President of Ukraine, and he’s made me more famous, and I’ve made him more famous.  (Laughter.)  I will say he’s got a great reputation.  He’s very, very strongly looking into all sorts of corruption and some of the problems they’ve had over the years.  I think it’s one of the primary reasons he got elected.  His reputation is absolutely sterling.  And it’s an honor to be with you.\nAnd we spoke a couple of times, as you probably remember.  And they’d like to hear every single word, and we give them every single word, and then they’ll say, “Well, about today?”  I think the press would like to stay in the meeting, but we have lots of witnesses, if you’d like to have it.\nBut the country of — our country is doing phenomenally well.  We are — we have the best economy we’ve ever had.  We have the best employment numbers that we’ve ever had.  We have now almost 160 million people working, which is more than we’ve ever had.  So we’re doing very well in every respect.  And I have a feeling that your country is going to do fantastically well.  And whatever we can do.  You just take care of yourself.  Thank you.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\nThank you very much.  It’s a great pleasure to me to be here, and it’s better to be on TV than by phone, I think.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.  (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  And, Mr. President, thank you very much.  And I’m not the first time to stay in New York —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Right.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  — but I know that you’ve never been in Ukraine.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  That’s right.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  And your predecessor also — how do you say it in English? — didn’t find time; I mean that.  (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Right.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  So, can you give me a word that you will come to our great country?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I’m going to try.  (Laughter.)  And I know a lot of people — I will say this: I know a lot of people from Ukraine.  They’re great people.  And I owned something called the Miss Universe pageants years ago, and I sold it to IMG.  And when I ran for President, I thought maybe it wouldn’t be the greatest thing to own the Miss Universe and Miss USA pageants.  But it’s a great thing.  And we had a winner from Ukraine, and we’ve really had — we got to know the country very well in a lot of different ways.  But it’s a country, I think, with tremendous potential.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  Yes, I know it, because I’m from this country.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Right.  (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  And I want to thank you for the invitation to Washington.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Right.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  You invited me.  But I think — I’m sorry, but I think you forgot to tell me the date.  (Laughter.)  But I think in the near future.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  They’ll tell you the date.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  (Laughs.)  Yes, they know before us.  And I want to thank you — to thank you, especially, Mr. President, to USA, to your government.  Like I said, I know many people, many faces, like the Second Family, after you — my Ukrainian family, we know each other.\nThank you for your support, especially now when — you know, when we have two — really, two wars in Ukraine.  The first one is with corruption, you know.  But we’ll fight — no, we’ll be winner in this fight, I’m sure.  And the priority — my priority is to stop the war on Donbass and to get back our territories: Crimea, Donbass, Luhansk.\nThank you for your support in this case.  Thank you very much.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, thank you very much, Mr. President.  If you remember, you lost Crimea during a different administration, not during the Trump administration.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  Yeah.  So you have chance to help us.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  That’s right.  I do.  But that was during the Obama administration that you lost Crimea, and I didn’t think it was something that you should have.  But that was done a long time ago, and I think it was handled poorly.  But it’s just one of those things.\nOne of the elements that we discussed is the United States helps Ukraine, but I think that other countries should help Ukraine much more than they’re doing — Germany, France, the European Union nations.  They really should help you a lot more.  And I think maybe, together, we’ll work on that.  They have to feel a little bit guilty about it because they don’t do what they should be doing.\nYou’re very important to the European Union.  You’re very important — strategically, very important.  And I think they should spend a lot more in helping Ukraine.  And they know that also, and they actually tell me that, but they don’t seem to produce.  So I’m sure you’ll talk to them, and I’ll certainly be talking to them.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  And, you know, now we need — I want to tell you that we now (inaudible) the new country.  And, I’m sorry, but we don’t need help; we need support.  Real support.  And we thank — thank everybody, thank all of the European countries; they each help us.  But we also want to have more — more.  But I understand, so only together, America and EU — only together we can stop the war.  And, you know, we are ready.  We just want to tell that we are — remember that we are the biggest country in Europe, but we want to be the richest one.  It’s true; it’s in my heart.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, you know, you have great people in Ukraine, and you have very talented people —\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  Very smart.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  — in terms of manufacturing, in terms of some of the things they do.  And we’ll be doing — we’re doing trading already, but we should be doing a lot more trading with Ukraine.  But you have very talented people.  They make great things.  You’re at the top of the line, really.  So that’s very important.\nAnd the other thing is I’ve heard you actually have — over the last fairly short period of time, you’ve really made some progress with Russia.  I hear a lot of progress has been made.  And just keep it going.  It’d be nice to end that whole disaster.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  First of all, I want to tell you, before — before the relations with Russia — I will prolong, just one minute — I mean, you have to know — I want world to know that now we have the new team, the new parliament, the new government.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Right.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  So now we (inaudible) about 74 laws, new laws, which help for our new reforms: land reform, big privatization.  They did the law about concessions.  Did — we (inaudible) general for security, and we launched the Service Secretary.\nIs it right Service Secretary?\nAIDE:  Yes.  Anti-corruption court, as well.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  An anti-corruption court.  As we came, we did — we launched the anti-corruption court.  It began to work on the 5th of September.  It was — you know, it was — after five days, we had the new government.\nSo, we are ready.  We want to show that we — we just come.  And if somebody, if you — if you want to help us, so just let’s do businesses cases.  We have many investment cases.  We’re ready.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And stop corruption in Ukraine, because that will really make you great.  That will make you great personally, and it’ll also be so tremendous for your nation, in terms of what you want to do and where you want to take it.\nThank you very much.  It’s a great honor.\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\nQ    President Zelensky, have you felt any pressure from President Trump to investigate Joe Biden and Hunter Biden?\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  I think you read everything.  So I think you read text.  I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic, open elections — elections of USA.\nNo, you heard that we had, I think, good phone call.  It was normal.  We spoke about many things.  And I — so I think, and you read it, that nobody pushed — pushed me.\nYes.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  In other words, no pressure.\nQ    President Trump, would — President Trump, would you like Mr. Zelensky to —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Because you know what?  There was no pressure.  And you know there was — and, by the way, you know there was no pressure.  All you have to do it see it, what went on on the call.  But you know that.  But you can ask a question, and I appreciate the answer.\nGo ahead.\nQ    Mr. President, would you like President Zelensky to do more on Joe Biden and investigate (inaudible)?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  No.  I want him to do whatever he can.  This was not his fault; he wasn’t there.  He’s just been here recently.  But whatever he can do in terms of corruption, because the corruption is massive.\nNow, when Biden’s son walks away with millions of dollars from Ukraine, and he knows nothing, and they’re paying him millions of dollars, that’s corruption.\nWhen Biden’s son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund — and the biggest funds in the world can’t get money out of China — and he’s there for one quick meeting, and he flies in on Air Force Two, I think that’s a horrible thing.  I think it’s a horrible thing.\nBut I’m going far beyond that.  I know the President, and I’ve read a lot about Ukraine.  I’ve read a lot about a lot of countries.  He wants to stop corruption.\nHe was elected — I think, number one — on the basis of stopping corruption, which unfortunately has plagued Ukraine.  And if he could do that, he’s doing, really, the whole world a big favor.  I know — and I think he’s going to be successful.\nQ    Mr. President, on Rudy Giuliani, why do you think it’s appropriate for your personal attorney to get involved in government business?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, you’d have to ask Rudy.  I will tell you —\nQ    You mentioned it to the President here.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I will tell you this, that Rudy is looking to also find out where the phony witch hunt started, how it started.  You had a Russian witch hunt that turned out to be two and half years of phony nonsense.\nAnd Rudy Giuliani is a great lawyer.  He was a great mayor.  He’s highly respected.  I’ve watched the passion that he’s had on television over the last few days.  I think it’s incredible the way he’s done.\nWhat he’s at is he wants to find out where did this Russian witch hunt that you people really helped perpetrate — where did it start.  How come it started?  It was all nonsense.  It was a hoax.  It was a total hoax.  It was a media hoax and a Democrat hoax.  Where did it start?\nAnd Rudy has got every right to go and find out where that started.  And other people are looking at that, too.  Where did it start?  The enablers — where did it all come from?  It was out of thin air.  And I think he’s got a very strong right to do it.  He’s a good lawyer; he knows exactly what he’s doing.  And it’s very important.\nQ    Mr. President, do you believe that the emails from Hillary Clinton — do you believe that they’re in Ukraine?  Do you think this whole thing originated —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think they could be.  You mean the 30,000 that she deleted?\nQ    Yes.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah, I think they could very well — boy, that was a nice question.  I like that question.  (Laughter.)  Because, frankly, I think that one of the great crimes committed is Hillary Clinton deleting 33,000 emails after Congress sends her a subpoena.  Think of that.  You can’t even do that in a civil case; you can’t get rid of evidence like that.  She deleted 33,000 emails after — not before — after receiving the subpoena from the U.S. Congress.\nI mean, I have never heard — now, she’s done far worse than that.  Although, I don’t know how much worse it can be.  But there were many other things she did that were wrong.  But that’s so obvious.  She gets a subpoena from the United States Congress and she deletes them.  And then she said, as I remember it, that, “Oh, well, they had to do with the wedding and yoga.”  She does a lot of yoga, right?  So they had 33,000 emails about the wedding of her daughter and yoga.  I don’t think so.\nHow she got away with that one is just — but it’s one of many.  And it’s corrupt government.  Because we have corruption also, Mr. President.  We have a lot of corruption in our government.  And when you see what happened with Hillary Clinton, when you see what happened with Comey, and McCabe, and all of these people — we have a lot of things going on here too.  Hopefully, it’s going to be found out very soon.  But I think that a lot of progress has been made.  A lot of progress has been made.\nQ    Will the military aid continue?  Can you assure that it will continue in the future?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, we’re working with Ukraine.  And we want other countries to work with Ukraine.  When I saw “work,” I’m referring to money.  They should put up more money.  We put up a lot of money.  I gave you anti-tank busters that — frankly, President Obama was sending you pillows and sheets.  And I gave you anti-tank busters.  And a lot of people didn’t want to do that, but I did it.\nAnd I really hope that Russia — because I really believe that President Putin would like to do something.  I really hope that you and President Putin get together and can solve your problem.  That would be a tremendous achievement.  And I know you’re trying to do that.\nQ    President Zelensky, in the phone call, you said that you would look into Joe Biden — you would ask your prosecutor to look into the matter.  Have you had that conversation —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think — no, I haven’t.  But I think that — I think this —\nQ    I’m asking President Zelensky.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think that somebody, if you look at what he did, it’s so bad — where his son he goes to China, he walks away with a billion and a half dollars.  He goes to Ukraine and he walks away with $50,000 a month and a lot of money in addition to that.  And the whole thing with the prosecutor in Ukraine.\nAnd he’s on tape.  This isn’t like “maybe he did it, maybe he didn’t.”  He’s on tape doing this.  I saw this a while ago.  I looked at it and I said, “That’s incredible.  I’ve never seen anything like that.”  Now, either he’s dumb, or he thought he was in a room full of really good friends, or maybe it’s a combination of both, in his case.\nQ    President Zelensky —\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  I heard your question.  Thank you very much.  Don’t cry.\nI mean that we have independent country and independent general security.  I can’t push anyone, you know?  That’s it.  That is the question — that is the answer.   So I didn’t call somebody or the new general security.  I didn’t ask him.  I didn’t push him.  That’s it.\nQ    Do you feel obligated to fulfill your promises to President Trump?\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  Just — sorry.\nQ    (Speaks Ukrainian.)\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  (Speaks Ukrainian.)\n(As interpreted.)  Obligated to do what?  (Speaks Ukrainian.)\nQ    (Speaks Ukrainian.)\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  (Speaks Ukrainian.)\nQ    (Speaks Ukrainian.)\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  (Speaks Ukrainian.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  You want to just —\nPRESIDENT ZELENSKY:  I’m sorry.\n(As interpreted.)  Concerning the investigation, actually, I want to underscore that Ukraine is an independent country.  We have a new prosecutor general in Ukraine — a highly professional man with a Western education and history to investigate any case he considers and deems appropriate.\nWhile we have many more issues to care about and to tackle, we have (inaudible), we have Maidan, we have corruption cases, as President Trump rightly mentioned about that.  So we know what to do, and we know where to go and what to tackle.\nQ    President Trump, is it appropriate to ask the Attorney General to be involved in this matter?\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead.\nQ    Did you ask House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to find a way out of impeachment yesterday?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Not at all.  No.  Look, she’s lost her way.  She’s been taken over by the radical left.  She may be a radical left herself, but she really has lost her way.  I spoke to her about guns yesterday.  She didn’t even know what I was talking about.  She’s not interested in guns.\nQ    Did it even come up or no?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I’ll tell you what: Nancy Pelosi is not interested in guns and gun protection and gun safety.  All she is thinking about is this.  She’s been taken over by the radical left, the whole Democrat Party.  And you take a look at what’s happening in the media today.  The whole party is taken over by the left.\nAnd thank you very much.  My poll numbers have gone up.  But I don’t want it to go up for this reason.  When they look, and when you see what’s happening, people are really angry at Democrats.  They’re really angry at the Democrat Party.\nAnd things like, as an example, drug pricing — getting drugs down — things like gun safety, infrastructure, the Democrats can’t talk about that because they’ve been taken over by a radical group of people.  And Nancy Pelosi, as far as I’m concerned, unfortunately she’s no longer the Speaker of the House.\nThank you very much, everybody.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.\nEND\n2:36 P.M.

        "text": "InterContinental New York BarclayNew York, New York\n12:44 P.M. EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, thank you very much.  We have some of our great farmers and ranchers and businesspeople in the room, and likewise Japan.  And we have tremendous representatives — some of the biggest people anywhere in the world — what we’re going and the agreement that we just signed.  And it’s an honor to have you with us.  I thought you could join us for this meeting.\nWe’ll be talking about certain elements of business and trade, and it would be good to have you with us because you’ll give us some very good ideas.\nWe’re working on phase two already with Japan.  I just want to thank Prime Minister Abe and all of your representatives for working so nicely.  It’s a tremendous thing that just took place.  And they won’t report it today; it gets lost with other fake news.  But it’s still big.  When you get back to your areas, you’re going to report it.  That’s going to be the front-page news.  That really is the real news.\nSo it’s a tremendous trade deal.  It’s a very big trade deal.  I want to thank Bob Lighthizer.  I want to thank your counterpart.  Congratulations.  Great job.  And took a lot of work to get it done for this particular week.  This was a very important week to all of us.\nBut most importantly — and if you folks have anything to say — you’re the biggest human beings I’ve ever seen with the cowboys hats.  (Laughter.)  If you have anything to say, I would love to have your ideas.\nBefore I do that, I’d like to just introduce Prime Minister Abe, who’s been my friend, who has worked so well with us in so many ways.  They’re spending a tremendous amount of money in our country also, building automobile factories, automobile plants.\nMany of the great Japanese companies, at my request, are now building their plants in the United States, in Detroit, and very, very many other places.  We’re all over Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, North Carolina.  We have many plants going up right now — not all from Japan, by the way, but many, many plants.  Big ones going up in South Carolina, Florida.  It’s been really amazing what’s happened.  For years, we didn’t have an auto plant being built, and now we have many of them being built.  So, it’s been terrific.\nMr. Prime Minister, perhaps you’d like to say a few things, but I want to — I really appreciate everything you’ve done.  It’s really nice.\nPRIME MINISTER ABE:  (As interpreted.)  Once again, I would like to share with you all my enthusiasm about the fact that, together, with President Trump, I could sign the Japan-U.S. statement, marking the final agreement of the Japan-U.S. trade negotiations that we have had so far.\nAs a matter of fact, in terms of the GDP, the United States is the world’s largest, number one economy, and Japan is the third-largest economy.  And by having this first- and third-largest economies coming to the table and announcing this new agreement means that we will be able to have the very wonderful, positive impact on the global economy as a whole.  So I do think that the newly agreed agreement will be something that we have to be proud of as a wonderful achievement.\nSo, since our last meeting on the margins of G20 Osaka Summit, back in June, within the period of the last three months, we have additional eight investment projects in the United States.  And I’m very happy to update you about the new status of the Japanese investment.  And also, over the last 12 months, we have a total of 31 investment projects in the United States.\nAnd I do think that the achievements that we just announced will bring benefit, of course, to your people — American stakeholders, as well as American farmers and others.  But also, this will bring benefit to Japanese farmers, Japanese investor representatives, workers, as well as consumers.  So I do think that this agreement will bring benefits to both sides.\nSo, in this plenary session, I look forward to having a discussion with Mr. President on the current situation surrounding the Middle East and how we can work together to mitigate the tension.  And also, I would like to cover other international challenges.  And, of course, we would love to discuss the issue of North Korea.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Very good.  We’ll do that.\nYou folks, I know you’re very happy, but do you have any suggestions for the future as far as your industry and your whole way of life go?  Because you’ve — we’ve taken in a lot of purchases.  A lot of money is coming your way.  What other suggestions would you have?  Would you have anything, while we’re all together?\nYes.\nMR. SMITH:  Mr. President —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes.\nMR. SMITH:  — as the President-elect of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association — otherwise, the big guy in a cowboy hat —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Right.  That’s right.\nMR. SMITH:  — thank you so much for bringing this agreement to the table and bringing us what you said: a fair and reciprocal trade agreement.  What do we want?  That is all that we ever want.  We asked for a level playing field, and you delivered that to us, and we thank you for that.  And it’s a great day too for, we think, for the Japanese people.  This will enable them to buy more American beef, more American agricultural products.  It offsets —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And much better beef.  Much better beef.  (Laughter.)  Not even a contest.\nMR. SMITH:  And we are — and American agriculture, here’s one industry that can help offset that trade deficit.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.\nMR. SMITH:  And so this gives us that opportunity, it gives them that opportunity.  They have been our largest export partner to date, even with higher tariffs and an uneven playing field.  Today, you bring us that playing field we asked for.\nIn our world, in agriculture, making a commitment to somebody and living up to it is (inaudible).  And you brought us that despite what sometimes the press wants to say about it.  Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.  Well, I’m glad you said that about the press.  It’s true.  (Laughter.)\nYou know, China is starting very big purchases also.  I don’t know if you know that.\nMR. SMITH:  Yes.  Very much so.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  But you see that China is back in the market.  They’re starting big purchases of ag.  Our farmers are very happy.  Our ranchers are very happy.  But that’s starting — including beef and including pork.\nMR. SMITH:  Absolutely.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  In particular, pork — they’re buying vast amounts.  So, China has started that, and they wanted to let me know, and they have let me know a number of times.  But more importantly, I heard from our farmers and ranchers that they’re seeing tremendous orders coming in from China.  So that’s very good.\nAnybody else have a question?\nMR. DUVALL:  Mr. President, Zippy Duvall, American Farm Bureau.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.  Sure.\nMR. DUVALL:  We just want to say thank you so much.  We want to thank the Japanese people and the delegations for leveling this playing field.  And what we need in the future is more agreements like this all around the world.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yeah.\nMR. DUVALL:  And what we need is trade, and that’s what makes a rural America grow.  But I want to also say to you that the farmers and ranchers of this country appreciate you standing up for us and standing up for the American people, and to continue to show your support for rural America.  We appreciate it, and we look forward to continue work with you on that.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, thank you.  And you are doing a fantastic job representing the folks.  And I will say this: The American farmer and rancher has been targeted by China, and they never once came to me and they said, “Sir, please make a deal.  Just make any deal; get us back.”  They never did.  But I went to you, and I said, “How much money have you lost over the last two years?”  And it was $12 million through Sonny, as you know.  Sonny said — Secretary of Agriculture — he said, “Sir, last year was 12 years — $12 billion.  And this year, it’s $16 billion.”  And they’re paying us many, many, many billions of dollars in tariffs.  And they’re eating it because they’ve devalued their currency.  They’re pouring money in.  They’ve really been eating the tariffs.\nAnd we’ve took it — we’ve taken it out of those tariffs and we gave the farmers $12 billion for two years ago.  And for last year, we gave $16 billion, divided up among the farmers.  So, they’re even.  I mean, I wanted to know, what was the number.  That was the number.  And we had, you know, tens of billions of dollars left over.  Because it will be well over $100 billion pretty soon that we will have taken into our Treasury.\nSo out of the big numbers, we took back — we paid to the farmer.  I don’t think there’s any other President ever in history that would’ve even thought of that.  And the reason I did it is because you’ve been so loyal.  Nobody says, “Oh, you’ve got to make a quick deal.”  This doesn’t go quick, to win it.  Now, China has got a lot of difficultly.  They lost 3 million jobs.  Their supply chains are broken up.  And they want to make a deal, and we want to make a deal, and I think there’s a good chance we’ll make a deal.\nBut the American farmer and rancher, like you, are great patriots.  You never came to me.  Others come, “Oh, please, could you make a crummy deal?  Just make any deal.  We don’t care.”  Farmers said, “Take your time.  We’re suffering.”  But I took the suffering away, in all fairness.  But if I didn’t do that, you’d still be with me because you’re great patriots.  So I want you to tell them that.\nBut we’re getting closer and closer.  But in the meantime, with Japan, it’s been a great day.  Thank you.  Thank you.\nMR. MARSHALL:  Mr. President, Roger Marshall from Kansas, representing one of the largest agriculture-producing states in the country.  This deal is huge for Kansas agriculture producers.\nMr. Prime Minister, thank you for your business.  We look forward to more opportunities to work with you.\nThe next thing that we need to work on is the USMCA agreement.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Right.\nMR. MARSHALL:  You asked us, “What’s next?” That’s what’s on top of our mind right now.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I don’t know if Nancy Pelosi is going to have any time to sign it.  That’s the only problem.  (Laughter.)\nWe have USMCA.  That’s a great point, Roger.  And I don’t think Nancy Pelosi will have time.  She’s wasting her time on a — you know, let’s use a word that they used to use a lot: a “manufactured crisis.”  Remember when they came up with the word nobody ever heard of?  And then every media group in the country used the same word that same day.  Nobody ever heard of the word, in relation to what they were talking about.  They said it was a “manufactured crisis.”  Okay?\nWell, they came up with a manufactured crisis, Roger.  I don’t know whether or not they’re going to have time to do any deals.  I don’t think they can do any deals.\nYou know, we were working on guns — gun safety.  They don’t even talk — all they’re talking about is nonsense.\nAnd we released something today that was fantastic.  And, you know, you look at that — it was — it’s all fake stuff that the media makes up with the Democrats, which are their partners.  The Democrats and the media are one in the same.  They’re partners.  So I want to thank you.\nBut I just don’t know.  You know, [US]MCA — you could tell me, Bob Lighthizer: Are they going to get to take a vote?  All they have to do is — the agreement is signed.  It’s approved by Canada.  It’s approved by Mexico.  It’s a great trade deal — the greatest we’ve ever had.  NAFTA was a horrible trade deal.  It replaces NAFTA.  We terminate NAFTA, and this takes over.\nIt’s phenomenal for farmers, it’s good for manufacturers, it’s good for everybody.  Even the unions want it because they’ve always hated NAFTA.  The unions want it.  I don’t know that they’re ever going to get to a vote because they’re all fighting.  The Democrats are all fighting with themselves.  So, we’ll see.  If it happens, it happens.  Otherwise, when we take over the House next year, we’ll do it our way.  And we’ll get it.  We’ll make it even better.\nBob Lighthizer, do you have a comment on that — USMCA?\nAMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER:  Well, I think that it will come up for a vote.  When it comes up for a vote, I’m confident that it will pass.  It’s 1.4 trillion dollars’ worth of trade and literally millions of American jobs.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  One of the biggest trade deals ever made.  It’s a fantastic deal for our country.  And, you know, it’s possible they won’t vote.  I mean, I know these people much better than you do.\nGo ahead.  Yeah.\nPARTICIPANT:  The U.S. wheat —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  How tall is the man next to you?  How tall are you?\nMR. PADGET:  Six-eight, sir.  (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And you weigh — I won’t ask you the weight, but you’re in good shape.\nMR. PADGET:  Three hundred.\nTHE PRESIDENT:  You look like an ex-football superstar.  Keep it up.  (Laughter.)  You eat a lot of beef, I assume.  Right?  (Laughter.)\nMR. PADGET:  Yes, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  You know, you should use him in an ad.  (Laughter.)\nAll right, go ahead.\nPARTICIPANT:  U.S. wheat has dealt with China for — I mean with, I’m sorry, Japan for 70 years now.  So 50 percent of the wheat that goes to Japan comes from the United States.  So this is a tremendous trade deal for the U.S. wheat.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  That’s great.  Yeah.  This is a great deal.  This is a great day.  They won’t report it.  You won’t see any articles, but we — at least we know.  But locally, you’re going to get great — you know, because locally, the press — you know, people don’t understand this, but locally, the press treats us very well.  Nationwide, just ridiculous.  They’re fake.  But we have gotten — so when you go back to your local states, you’re going to get tremendous press on this because this is what they’ve wanted.  They’ve wanted this really for a long time.\nAnd I think Kansas is doing pretty well.  Do you like this, man?\nPARTICIPANT:  Yes, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Here’s another man from Kansas, right?  (Laughter.)  How’s he doing?  Do they love him in Kansas?\nMR. MARSHALL:  Next to you, sir, he is the popular person in Kansas.  (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  He knows what to say.  Hey, I like him.  I like him.  Anyway, anybody else have anything to say?  Please.\nMR. HARRINGTON:  Mr. President, I’m Dave Harrington.  I’m President of the National Pork Producers Council.  I’ve never spent many days in New York, but this is the greatest day I’ve ever spent in New York.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Wow.\nMR. HARRINGTON:  Thank you and thank Prime Minister Abe for this agreement.  And it gives so much opportunity to our 60,000 pork producers across this great country.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  That’s great.\nMR. HARRINGTON:  And I can’t thank you for getting up and working hard every day.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And how are you doing with China?  Because they’re coming in big.  Tell me: How is pork doing with China?\nMR. HARRINGTON:  It’s just starting to turn around.  We’re starting —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Are you seeing — are you seeing the big movement now?\nMR. HARRINGTON:  It’s starting to move right now.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  They’re going to need a lot.\nMR. HARRINGTON:  They’re going to need a lot.  They’ve got some issues over there with African swine fever.  And we’re standing ready to help them out.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  So they are starting to come in and you can see that happening very big.  How will that compare to Japan, in terms of — ultimately, where do you see China versus Japan in terms of buys?\nMR. HARRINGTON:  Well, Japan has always been our largest value market, one of our greatest customers.  It’s hard to say, Mr. President.  But I think that, because of the disease they have over there today, they’re going to need — they’re short in supply of pork.  So I think there’s great opportunity.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, China is going to buy more pork than they’ve ever bought by far.  I mean, they told me the numbers are going to be incredible.  And they’re coming to you.\nMR. HARRINGTON:  And we’re going to help them out.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  So, look, they want to make a deal.  They’re trying to be nice.  I was nice to them.  You know, they had their — as you know, their 70th anniversary.  And it was very important to them.  Did you know?  Their 70th.  And it was October 1st; that’s when the tariffs get lifted.  And they called and they said, “Could you possibly make it another day?”  And we delayed it two weeks.  So we did them a favor.  But they’re doing us a favor.  But they’re buying a lot of agricultural product and, in particular, where you are.  Okay?\nMR. HARRINGTON:  Yes, sir.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.  That was a very nice statement.  Anybody else?  You guys all right?  Yes.  Please.\nMR. SUYDAM:  My name is Ryck Suydam.  I’m a 12th-generation farmer from Somerset County, New Jersey.  A lot of these folks here represent big ag.  I’m a small ag.  I’m a small farm — been there for 300 years.  But all of this helps raise agricul- — it’s going to help me —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Right.\nMR. SUYDAM:  — and a lot of small farmers all across this country.  So we had to get the first one done.  Thank you to Japan.  And next, we need the USMCA, and then China.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Right.\nMR. SUYDAM:  So big ag — good.  Small ag — good, too.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And we signed Korea, remember.  You know, we did a big deal with South Korea.  It’s a great trade deal.  It’s already done.  And it’s in action.  And it’s had a very, very positive impact.  It’s been very positive for us.  And that was a great deal that we got done relatively quickly.  But nobody talks about that one, you know?  By normal standards, a big deal.\nBut Japan is going to be special.  And this is my special friend.  Thank you.  Thank you all very much.  Thank you for being here.  (Applause.)\nThank you very much, everybody.\nEND\n1:02 P.M.

EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Are you ready?  Ready?  Thank you very much.  Thank you.\nI’m honored to be here today among so many terrific leaders dedicated to the future of democracy, prosperity, and freedom for the people of Venezuela.  We are behind you.\nFor this deeply important event, we are grateful to be joined by Secretary Mike Pompeo, Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Secretary Wilbur Ross, and Administrator Mark Green.  Thank you all for being here.  Thank you very much.\nI want to extend my profound appreciation to every representative with us from across the Western Hemisphere.  Each of you is part of a historic coalition of 55 countries that recognize the legitimate constitutional government of Venezuela.  We are especially grateful to be joined by representatives of the people of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, and Peru, for their leadership and assistance in the face of an unprecedented political, economic, and humanitarian disaster, which has been going on for a long time.  And we’re helping a lot.  We’re helping a lot.\nLet me also recognize two leaders from the government of Venezuela’s legitimate interim government, Presidential Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, Julio Borges.  Where’s Julio?  Julio?  Please, stand up, Julio.  Great.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  And Venezuela’s Ambassador to the United States, Carlos Vecchio.  Where’s Carlos?  Thank you, Carlos.  Please.  (Applause.)  It’s very nice.  Thank you.\nAs everyone in this room knows, the situation in Venezuela is a tragedy of historic proportions.  The Maduro regime does not care about the welfare of their own people.  They care about their own power.  It’s what they want, is power and money.  They want the money, too — not just power.\nSocialism has destroyed what was once among the most prosperous countries anywhere in the world.  You go back 20 years ago and you look: one of the wealthiest countries in the world, relatively speaking.  And now, they don’t have water, they don’t have food, they don’t have medicine, they don’t have anything.\nToday, Venezuelans are starving and they’re dying from lack of medicine, doctors, help.  According to U.N. Human Rights Commissioner, Maduro’s Cuban-trained death squads have murdered up to 10,000 Venezuelans, and they think that number is extremely low.  Citizens since — all since 2018.  That’s over a very short period of time.  These atrocities are an outrage to all and everything that we hold dear.\nAs President of the United States, I am committed to the future of stability, prosperity, and liberty for Venezuela.  We will stand with the Venezuelan people every single day until they are finally freed from this horrible and brutal oppression.  They will be freed.  It will happen.\nOur first objective is to ensure a peaceful and constitutional transition, paving the way for free and fair elections.  That’s why we, at the United States, and in the United States, are doing everything we can to isolate Maduro and his cronies.\nOver the past year, the U.S. Treasury Department has imposed very tough sanctions to prevent Maduro and his enablers from accessing the U.S. financial system.  Last month, I issued an executive order to completely freeze the assets of the Maduro regime in the United States.  Our sanctions have been tightly focused on closing down every avenue by which Maduro sustains his criminal and totalitarian rule.  And he has been vicious, he’s been corrupt.  He’s been as bad as you get.\nAt the same time, we have undertaken significant efforts to ensure that the Venezuelan people have access to food, medicine, and other humanitarian supplies, despite the regime’s efforts to stop aid from coming into Venezuela.  They are making it very, very hard to get aid into Venezuela.  We are getting aid into Venezuela, but it’s a very difficult thing.  You would think, frankly, that would be to their benefit to let aid get in instead of letting people die from lack of medicine or food.  But they don’t make it easy, but we get it in anyway.\nWe call on Maduro to immediately allow his lifesaving humanitarian aid.  This has to be allowed to come into Venezuela for the long-suffering Venezuelan people.  Unfortunately, a few countries outside of this hemisphere continue to enable this depraved regime with military and technological support.  The most significant factor propping up the Venezuelan regime is the communist dictatorship in Cuba.  Maduro allows Cuba to plunder Venezuelans’ oil, raid its wealth, and rob its people.  Venezuela’s oil is at a low point.  Not much is being taken out.  Not many people are in there because of the dangers involved. But nevertheless, there’s some money coming out, and it goes into Cuba.\nHe’s allowed thousands of Cuban agents to infiltrate Venezuela’s security forces and other institutions.  In other words, Maduro has sold out his nation to a foreign dictatorship, and it has been that way a long time.\nThe civilized world must pressure the Cuban regime to leave Venezuela immediately.  The United States is ready to support a democratic transition government, and we know that our partners around the world — of which we have many — are ready as well.  Venezuela’s rebuilding can begin the moment a peaceful transition occurs.\nThis is a critical moment for the world.  We must not allow the destructive forces of socialism and communism to repeat the horrors of the last century.  Can’t allow it to happen.  There have been horrors like nobody would believe.  We can’t allow this to happen today in Venezuela.  We resolve that the future of the Western Hemisphere will not be written by socialists and tyrants, but by liberty-loving patriots.  Our great destiny is to become the first fully free hemisphere in human history.  We have a very, very good chance of doing that.\nWe work and we pray for the hour when every person across the region, and every suffering soul in Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, will finally know the blessings of democracy and the full glory of freedom.\nOnce again, thank you all to so many of my friends in this room and to the nations that have helped us with respect to Venezuela and many other things.\nI want to personally thank the President of Mexico for the incredible work and spirit and everything that they’ve done on our southern border.  Our southern border has become secure, with 27,000 Mexican soldiers on the Mexican side, telling people, “Sorry, you can’t come in.”  So I want to thank the President of Mexico.  Thank you very much.\nAnd for Venezuela: It will all work.  It will all come back.  And good things will happen.\nThank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.\nQ    Mr. President, on the transcript, sir?  On the transcript, sir?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Okay.  You know what?  Because you’re so anxious, we’re going to let you stay as certain presidents speak.  Because I know that’s what you want to hear.\nSECRETARY POMPEO:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Let me do the introductions.  First of all, Mr. President, let me say how proud I am to be part of everything that you have led in this effort to try and bring the Venezuelan crisis to a peaceful and democratic resolution.  Your leadership has been outstanding.\nThe work of the Lima Group, too, has been important.  I believe it’s a sign of a new era in Latin America.  And like your nations, the United States is tired of the heartbreaking stories of Venezuelans forced to dig through trash cans for food, of the hospital patients dying unnecessarily, of the millions of innocent children who go to bed hungry every night because 94 percent of Venezuelan households can’t get their basic necessities.\nThe United States wants to announce today an additional tranche of $118 million to aid the Venezuelan crisis response.  The assistance will include $36 million for relief efforts inside of Venezuela.  They’ll provide urgently needed medicines that improve access to quality healthcare of for the Venezuelan people.  The remaining monies will protect and assist many of your countries, as you generously host a combined 4.4 million Venezuelans who have fled their country — over 10 percent of the Venezuelan population.  We’ll help provide food, shelter, clean water, and legal support for them.\nThis brings to over $570 million the amount of aid that we have provided — the United States has provided — to ease the crisis, both inside Venezuela and throughout the hemisphere.\nAs long as the Maduro regime stands, it will stand between the Venezuelan people and their return to freedom and prosperity.  The United States, under President Trump, remains a steadfast supporter of the Venezuelan people and of the Lima Group in its ongoing struggle for the prosperous, free, and democratic Venezuela.\nIt’s now my pleasure to introduce a member of the true government of Venezuela: Julio Borges.  Mr. Borges is a longtime supporter of a return to democracy in Venezuela, and for this, he has been forced into exile by the Maduro regime.  He now lives in Colombia.\nEarlier this year, Interim President Juan Guaidó appointed him as Venezuela’s representative to the Lima Group, and later as presidential advisor on external relationships.\nJulio, you’ve been instrumental in rallying the international community to place pressure on the Maduro regime, and we’re honored to have you with us today.  The floor is yours, sir.\nMR. BORGES:  Well, thank you.  Thank you for being here today.  I would like to make a five-minute introduction about what’s going on in Venezuela.\nI could be speaking in Spanish, but I have chosen to speak in English because, Mr. President, on behalf of the Venezuelan people, their democratic-elected National Assembly, and their President Juan Guaidó, I want to personally thank for the leadership that you have shown in our case.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.\nMR. BORGES:  Your leadership has made a big difference.  And I thank each and every one of you for what your governments have done to end the suffering in Venezuela and reclaim our democracy.  You have helped us in our time of great need, which is something no Venezuelan will ever forget.\nVenezuela is not alone.  Nicolás Maduro and his criminal regime is responsible for the historic crisis impacting our country.  To put it in perspective, from an economic standpoint of view: Venezuela’s economic crisis is almost three times bigger than the Great Depression.  And from the humanitarian point of view, it’s become the second-largest refugee exodus in the world.\nPresident Guaidó has been working closely with you to reverse the situation.  We, as a Venezuelan, has been fighting for almost 20 years.  We have gone down many paths, seeking a peaceful solution, but the dictatorship has stalled all possibilities time and time again.\nToday, Venezuela is not passively asking for solidarity.  The suffering of our people gives testimony of our times of need.  This sacrifice have achieved important accomplishments.\nLet’s be clear: The diplomatic pressure from democratic voices has been effective.  The dictatorship is fractured and weak, and only backed by the Cuban regime that has tortured, persecuted our people and our brave armed force.\nMichelle Bachelet’s recent report exposed the repression, torture, and executions that the regime carries out against civilians and members of our armed force in Venezuela.  Mr. President and all leaders of Americas, over the last year, regime force have murdered a citizen every two hours.\nHavana is the mastermind behind this tragedy to sustain Maduro.  This is why crucial to break the regime of Díaz-Canel, Raúl Castro, and Maduro with more democratic pressure.\nOur humble petition to the Americas is simple: First, that every country in the region should impose sanctions on Cuba.  It is time for Castro and Díaz-Canel to understand the consequences of supporting a criminal regime.\nSecond, every country in the region should move forward, as agreed to in TIAR, to prosecute any regime member involved in drug trafficking, human rights violations, and corruption.\nThird, maintain the support for Venezuelan National Assembly and our President, Juan Guaidó.\nAnd last but not least, compel Europe to more actively join efforts to put more pressures on Maduro regime.\nThe alliance between the Cuban and Venezuelan regimes holds over 50 million hostage.  Millions of Cubans and Venezuelans have had to abandon their homelands to escape oppression.  And this should not be tolerated.\nI have had the honor of traveling to the border of Cúcuta with President Duque, with President Piñera, with President Abdo, and as well with Secretary Pompeo.  And most recently, with Ivanka Trump.  I have seen them moved to tears because the stories of suffering cannot be put into words.  Mark has been many times over there as well.\nAs rightly so, because we are not talking about cold numbers or (inaudible) statistics.  Socialist dictatorships, such as Maduro, dehumanize.  With great pain, we have seen the regime has done the most vulnerable people in my country.  Child prostitution, President, has been normalized.  Women are being sold into slavery and taken to other countries for profit, while children and (inaudible) have been recruited by terrorist organizations linked to drug trafficking.  And our people are crawling through the streets of Venezuela looking for food.\nThe Maduro regime is a corrupt, criminal enterprise that has turned what once was one of the most prosperous country in the region into a living and dying hell.  The world needs to understand that Venezuela is not a dictatorship, not even a failed state.  It’s something worse.  The Maduro regime is a sanctuary for the promotion of terrorism, drug trafficking, and organized crime.\nFaced with this reality, there are those who are shocked when we say that no option can be ruled out to rid Venezuela and the region for this corrupt regime.  They say that keeping every option is very dangerous.  However, Mr. President, evidence shows that the worst thing that could happen in Venezuela is that nothing happens.\nWhat is truly dangerous, what is unacceptable, is having a regime destabilize the whole region while 35 million people are starving to death.  Ignoring the crisis in Venezuela leaves an open wound that will infect the region and will destroy democracy throughout the continent.  As I said, in the case of Venezuela, the worst thing that could happen is that nothing happens.\nPresidents and leaders of the Americas, on behalf of millions of Venezuela, I thank you because we are close to victory.\nPresident Trump, you have led the free world in the fight for freedom in Venezuela and Cuba.  History and the Venezuelan people will remember and recognize you.  Recent opinion research in Venezuela shows the total support for our policy, for your plans to Venezuela, and you have become the most important leader within Venezuela, which is very important for us.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Maybe I’ll move there.  (Laughter.)\nMR. BORGES:  All right.  (Laughter.)  Next time.\nI’m convinced that working together, working together the whole Americas, 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, another wall will fall in the Americas and give the way to a chapter of peace, progress, and development for our hemisphere.\nVenezuela will rise with the strength of its people.  We will reveal our country with the spirit of those who refuse to surrender.\nPresident and leaders of the Americas, 32 millions of Venezuelans and 12 millions of Cubans are at the gates of freedom.  Let’s not make them wait any longer.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:   Thank you.  Thank you.\nWould the presidents like to speak in front of the media or without the media?  We have three presidents who are going to speak.  Would you prefer the media or not, presidents?\nSECRETARY POMPEO:  President Duque, would you like to begin?\nPRESIDENT DUQUE:  Thank you so much, Mr. Secretary.  Thank you so much, President Trump, for gathering this very important meeting.  I’m going to be brief, but I’m going to try to be very (inaudible) in my statements.\nWhat we have been seeing in Venezuela is a tragedy of major proportional dimensions.  What we have seen is the worst humanitarian crisis in Latin America’s recent history.  What we have seen is the brutality of a dictatorship that is only comparable to what some countries saw when Slobodan Milošević brutalized thousands of people.\nThat’s why we consider him a criminal.  That’s why we have denounced him before the International Criminal Court with the support of many heads of state around the hemisphere, and also in Europe.  We consider his behavior to be not only regrettable, but it has to punished, and that’s why we all must continue to embrace the diplomatic blockade and to explore as many sanctions are needed against that criminal.\nThe second thing I want to highlight is that the migration crisis — it’s really producing a major social impact.  In Colombia, we have supported the migrants.  We have 1.4 million Venezuelan brothers and sisters, and we will continue to provide support because we know they’re coming to our country with (inaudible), lacking of medicine, and many of them without any access to food.\nBut we have to make the call to the whole world that this situation is unsustainable.  And that’s why the coalition that is sitting among this table, but also the coalition that has build of more than 54 states that have recognized President Guaidó and they have recognized the National Assembly, must also continue to bring more countries to the table, because this coalition has to be stronger day by day.\nI also want to highlight that the behavior of the dictatorship is also affecting the national security of many states, obviously including Colombia.  Nicolás Maduro has become a sponsor, and he’s providing safe haven to terrorist groups from Colombia to plot against the Colombian people.  And that attitude is only comparable to what the world saw when the Taliban regime allowed al Qaeda to plot against the whole world, in their soil.\nWe continue believing that that behavior is in direct violation of Resolution 1373 that was issued by the United Nations Security Council right after September 11.  And we’re going to make that denouncement public today when I deliver my speech before the U.N. General Assembly.  I will present a report that is going to be given to the U.N. Security Council, the U.N. Secretary-General.  And I believe that that report should be open for a debate.\nWe also believe that that behavior requires not only the whole world to be seen and to be addressed, but we also want to highlight what happened this week in a historical way.  The Inter-American Treaty for Reciprocal Assistance had a historical voting, and they recognized that the Maduro regime is pretty much involved in terrorism sponsorship, narco-trafficking activities.\nAnd last but not least, I also want to mention that the following months are crucial.  The following weeks, the following hours are crucial.  Some people speculate whether Maduro is going to last more.  But I continue the debate should be different.  The debate is: What is it that we’re going to do so that we can grant liberty to the Venezuelan people?\nThat’s why we’re gathered here at this table, and that’s why we support the approach of strengthening everything we can do so that three conditions are met: the end of the dictatorship, a transitionary government, the call for free elections, and maybe I’ll include a plan for economic and social recovery in Venezuela.\nThank you so much, Mr. President.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\nSECRETARY POMPEO:  Thank you, President Duque.  Now I would like to hear from President Piñera.  Please.\nPRESIDENT PIÑERA:  Thank you very much.  Well, we all know that we are dealing with a criminal, corrupt — (microphone is turned on.)  I’m sorry.\nThank you very much.  We all know that we are dealing with a criminal, corrupt, and drug-related regime.  And the conclusion is very clear: This dictatorship has to stop.\nMaduro is part of the problem and will never be part of the solution.  The solution has been expressed by President Duque.  We need to end this regime, have a transitional government, call to free and open and transparent elections, and then the big story of how to reconstruct Venezuela will start.  And we will be supporting all of these stages.\nBut at the same time, we have to realize there are some allies that are helping Venezuela, and we are talking — we are talking about countries like Cuba, China, Russia, Iran, and Turkey.  I think that the whole Latin American community, and maybe the whole world, should let them very clear that what they are doing is affecting — and it’s really affecting the interests of all Latin American countries.\nWe know that we have already more than 4.5 million refugees — migrants.  But probably the number will double if the situation stays as it is.  In the case of Chile, we have received more than 450,000, which is about 2 percent of our population.  Compared to the U.S., it would be equivalent to 6 million Venezuelans in the U.S.\nAnd we are happy to do so because that’s one way to help.  But the solution and the final conclusion here should be we have to make it impossible for the regime to continue.\nOne thing is that we have to seize all their assets of their main members of this dictators; avoid and prevent any moment so that the situation will become more and more difficult for them; and, at the same time, we have to help and solidarize and continue with the democratic opposition in Venezuela.\nBut I know the situation is very, very difficult.  But you know that the night never is so dark that just before dawn.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\nSECRETARY POMPEO:  Thank you, President Piñera.  President Moreno, the floor is yours, sir.\nPRESIDENT MORENO:  (As interpreted.)  Thank you.  My dear colleagues, the ill that brings us here today has to do with the democracy of the world and the stability of a region.  It is related specifically to this people — this people who was suffering and the presidents around the table from countries to which over 4 million migrants have gone; people who are living beings, who wander the streets, they wander our avenues, looking for refuge.  They seek a way out.  They seek a solution to the problems they face when it comes to hunger, safety, and health.  They have been kicked out by this regime.  They seek social justice.\nHowever, this regime has been despotic for so many years, and it is due to this.  But international action should never be interpreted as intervention.  We cannot talk about intervention because all countries, including Venezuela, have signed all commitments, all agreements related to the democracy of this community.\nThis is an ethical obligation as well.  My colleagues who preceded me have stated this.  We are talking about over 4 million people, who are humble people, who have fled, who flee this despotic regime, this criminal regime — the regime of Nicolás Maduro, which is the most corrupt, which harbors terrorists, and where all international criminals go in the end to seek refuge, including those who represented corrupt regimes in our countries.\nThis is why it is — this meeting is so important.  This meeting is important because I would like to energetically make the call for democracy to be put into place in Venezuela, as it should be in a country that has lived in democracy for so long.  They cannot be going through a genocidal regime.  The only exit is democracy — democracy with a broad international observation, with no pressure, with no red spots, so that people are able to vote freely.\nThis cannot happen under any circumstances unless they’re — unless all democratic institutions, all international organizations involved in democracy participate, are involved in making sure that the will of Venezuelans is no longer deceived.\nVenezuela is most definitely a failed state.  It is a failed state, and this is shown by the exit not of dissidents, not people opposed to policies.  We’re talking about humble people — people who are personally living through how terrible it has been to suffer through the regime of a despot.\nUnfortunately, we have to hear that this is a Bolivarian republic.  No, we are a Bolivarian republic.  We are aligned with the ideals of Washington, of Jefferson, and we converge with the ideals of Bolívar.  And Bolívar never would have imagined any like this.  Bolívar must be turning in his grave.\nLooking at everything that has happened to a democracy that at one time was among the most prosperous in Latin America — and I will say this again — that is why this meeting is such a great one, and it will be great as long we can talk about benefitting that democracy.  Maduro must leave power and, immediately, there must be a call for elections.  That is the only way out.  That is the only way out for this people.  As I said, there must be elections with broad international observation.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you very much.\nQ    Mr. President, in the Ukraine transcript, sir, you talk about how good the U.S. has been to Ukraine.  You ask President Zelensky for a favor.  And you ask him to talk to the Attorney General of the United States and Rudy Giuliani about Joe Biden.  Sir, how is that not pressuring President Zelensky?  How does the transcript —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  There was no pressure whatsoever.  And if you take a look at the Democrats, they went down to see the President of Ukraine, and they asked him for all sorts of things.  And, “Don’t go with the Republicans,” and, “Stay with us.”  And — like it’s a political war.  They shouldn’t have done that.  That should be an impeachable event, I guess, based on what you’re saying.\nThe Democrats just came out.  They went down there — a group of people — some of whom I was dealing with on the gun issue.  And they went down and put tremendous pressure on Ukraine.  The President himself just came out with a statement saying there was absolutely no pressure put on him.  And there wasn’t.\nWhat I do want to see is, is I want to see other countries helping Ukraine also, not just us.  As usual, the United States helps, and nobody else is there.  So I want to see other countries help.\nJust so you understand, it’s the single greatest witch hunt in American history — probably, in history, but in American history.  It’s a disgraceful thing.  The letter was a great letter.  Meaning, the letter revealing the call.  That was done at the insistence of myself and other people that read it.  It was a friendly letter.  There was no pressure.  The way you had that built up — that call — it was going to be the call from hell.  It turned out to be a nothing call, other than a lot of people said, “I never knew you could be so nice.”\nSo, part of the problem you have is you have the fake news.  You have a lot of corrupt reporting.  You have some very fine reporters and journalists, but you have a lot of corrupt reporters, a lot of corrupt journalists.  I would rate you right in there, by the way.\nAnd —\nQ    You said —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Excuse me.  Excuse me.\n(Cross-talk.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Excuse me.  Excuse me.\nSo, we’re having — if you noticed, the stock market went up.  When they saw the nonsense, all of a sudden the stock market went down very substantially yesterday when they saw a charge.  After they read the charge, the stock market went up very substantially.\nWe have created the greatest economy in the history of our country.  The greatest economy in the world.  Had my opponent won, China would right now be the number one economy, by far.  And right now, China is way behind us and they’ll never catch us if we have smart leadership.  Way behind.\nWe’ve picked up trillions of dollars, and they’ve lost trillions of dollars.  And they want to make a deal very badly.  And it could happen.  It could happen.  It could happen.  It could happen sooner than you think.\nOur military is rebuilt.  Our military has never been stronger.  When I came in, it was depleted.  Our vets are happy.  So many great things are happening.  And the Democrats feel they’re going to lose.  We had the highest poll number — Rasmussen — 53, but they say you could add 10 to it.  A lot of people say you could add more than 10 to it because a lot of people just don’t want to talk about it, but they want to vote for Trump.\nSo I just say this: We have the strongest country we’ve ever had.  We have the best economy we’ve ever had.  We have the best unemployment numbers we’ve ever had.  We have the best employment numbers we’ve ever had.  We have now almost 160 million people working.  That’s far more than we’ve ever had working in our country before.\nThank you very much, everybody.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.\nEND\n10:52 A.M.

        "text": "InterContinental New York BarclayNew York, New York\n12:04 P.M. EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much everybody for being here.  I’m honored to be alongside my great friend, Prime Minister Abe of Japan, to formally announce our first stage of a phenomenal new trade agreement with our close ally.  They’ve been a great friend, and the Prime Minister has been my great friend.\nI want to thank Ambassador Lighthizer for his extraordinary work in these negotiations.  He works 24 hours a day.  He never sleeps.  (Laughter.)  He’s a great gentleman.  When I first got this job, everybody was saying, “You got to get Lighthizer.  You have to get Lighthizer.”  He’s a great and fine man who also gets along with the other side, and in particular with Japan.  They’ve developed a really great mutual respect.\nI’m grateful as well to several members of my Cabinet for joining us this afternoon — and that’s Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary Ross, Secretary Pompeo.  And my thanks also to Representative Roger Marshall.\nIn a moment, the Prime Minister and I will sign a document outlining the significant steps we’re taking toward a fair and reciprocal trade agreement.  We insist on fairness and we insist on reciprocal — we want reciprocal agreements from now on because — and I’m not just talking about Japan.  I’m talking about virtually every nation in the world.  They have not been reciprocal.  They’ve been one-way streets.\nUnder the market access agreement that we’re announcing today, Japan will open new markets to approximately $7 billion in American agricultural products.  Japanese tariffs will now be significantly lower, or eliminated entirely, for U.S. beef, pork, wheat, cheese, corn, wine, and so much more.\nThis is a huge victory for America’s farmers, ranchers, and growers.  And that’s very important to me.\nAnd it’s very important that you report this news, as opposed to not reporting it, because it’s great for our farmers, as you know, and ranchers, and for a lot of other people.\nWe also reached a deal for robust commitments on $40 billion of digital trade between our two countries.  This will greatly expand commerce across cutting-edge products and services.\nJapan is one of America’s most important economic partners.  We are Japan’s top foreign investor, by far.  And Japanese investments in America supports hundreds of thousands of American jobs.\nThe deal we’re announcing today will reduce our chronic trade deficit built up and taken effect over many, many years of dealing with other governments and other administrations, and it’ll deepen our enduring national ties.  It’s a very important deal.\nOur teams will continue negotiations on remaining areas of interest to achieve a final comprehensive agreement.  We’re negotiating very, very big transactions with Japan.  Some of them — I think probably all of them in the not-too-distant future will happen.  This is a big chunk.\nBut in the fairly near future, we’re going to be having a lot more very comprehensive deals signed with Japan.\nSo this is tremendous for our technology industries, but in particular, these are really big dollars for our farmers and for our ranchers.\nI want to congratulate Prime Minister Abe.  Not so long ago, he had a tremendous election victory.  He won by a lot, and a lot of people say that it was only his friendship with President Trump that got him that tremendous victory.  (Laughter.)\nSo, Shinzo, I want to thank you again for your steadfast partnership.  I look forward to continuing to work closely with you as we pursue lasting prosperity and peace for our people.  And congratulations to the people of Japan and congratulations on your great victory.  Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER ABE:  (As interpreted.)  Thank you, Donald.  For the past 12 months, since we have signed the Japan-U.S. joint statement back in September 2018, we have had strenuous negotiations between Japan and the United States.  And I am very delighted that today, together with you, we are announcing final agreement on our trade agreement.\nOne of the highlights of this new agreement is that under this agreement, we together, we’ll be able to bring benefit to everyone in Japan as well in the United States, namely consumers, producers, as well as workers.  So the outcome of this negotiation is actually a win-win solution for Japan and the United States.\nSo under the new agreement, I do believe that we have successfully covered a wide range of areas, including not only the industrial goods, but also the agricultural products and also the digital trade between the two sides.  And I am convinced that now, with these two agreements in place, we will be able to develop both economies of Japan and the United States as we move forward.\nSo, in your first statement, you applauded the great work done by Ambassador Lighthizer and also the wonderful American team.  And from my own perspective, I do share your great applaud for the American team because they have been very, very tough throughout the negotiation process.  (Laughter.)  And to live up to your expectation, and also to meet the (inaudible) between Japan and the United States, I specifically assigned this important work to now the Foreign Minister, Foreign Minister Motegi, and his team.  And I am sure that he did a great job, too.\nAnd I do believe that the outcome of this negotiation is namely the crystallization of the strenuous and persistent efforts made by Minister Motegi and his team.  And also, I like to underscore that both Minister Motegi and Ambassador Lighthizer did take care and also took into account the national interest of Japan and the United States, respectively.\nAnd now, here we are today to share this final agreement.  And I’m so glad that Donald also shared my aspiration, and you join us and join me in making this final judgement — decision to announce the final agreement on the two agreements between Japan and the United States.\nSince your inauguration, Japan is the number one investor in the United States.  In total of 25.7 billion U.S. dollar investment was already announced by Japan, which have already created more than 50,000 jobs for American people.\nAnd I am convinced that when we are to have the entry into force of the Japan-U.S. trade agreement, as well as Japan-U.S. digital trade agreement, we will further galvanize the investment in the two sides, and also we’ll be able to deepen our economic relations.  So once again, this will be a win-win outcome for Japan and the United States.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\n(The agreement is signed.)  (Applause.)\nEND\n12:18 P.M.

        "text": "United Nations HeadquartersNew York, New York\nSeptember 24, 2019\n10:12 A.M. EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, distinguished delegates, ambassadors, and world leaders:\nSeven decades of history have passed through this hall, in all of their richness and drama.  Where I stand, the world has heard from presidents and premiers at the height of the Cold War.  We have seen the foundation of nations.  We have seen the ringleaders of revolution.  We have beheld saints who inspired us with hope, rebels who stirred us with passion, and heroes who emboldened us with courage — all here to share plans, proposals, visions, and ideas on the world’s biggest stage.\nLike those who met us before, our time is one of great contests, high stakes, and clear choices.  The essential divide that runs all around the world and throughout history is once again thrown into stark relief.  It is the divide between those whose thirst for control deludes them into thinking they are destined to rule over others and those people and nations who want only to rule themselves.\nI have the immense privilege of addressing you today as the elected leader of a nation that prizes liberty, independence, and self-government above all.  The United States, after having spent over two and a half trillion dollars since my election to completely rebuild our great military, is also, by far, the world’s most powerful nation.  Hopefully, it will never have to use this power.\nAmericans know that in a world where others seek conquest and domination, our nation must be strong in wealth, in might, and in spirit.  That is why the United States vigorously defends the traditions and customs that have made us who we are.\nLike my beloved country, each nation represented in this hall has a cherished history, culture, and heritage that is worth defending and celebrating, and which gives us our singular potential and strength.\nThe free world must embrace its national foundations.  It must not attempt to erase them or replace them.\nLooking around and all over this large, magnificent planet, the truth is plain to see: If you want freedom, take pride in your country.  If you want democracy, hold on to your sovereignty.  And if you want peace, love your nation.  Wise leaders always put the good of their own people and their own country first.\nThe future does not belong to globalists.  The future belongs to patriots.  The future belongs to sovereign and independent nations who protect their citizens, respect their neighbors, and honor the differences that make each country special and unique.\nIt is why we in the United States have embarked on an exciting program of national renewal.  In everything we do, we are focused on empowering the dreams and aspirations of our citizens.\nThanks to our pro-growth economic policies, our domestic unemployment rate reached its lowest level in over half a century.  Fueled by massive tax cuts and regulations cuts, jobs are being produced at a historic rate.  Six million Americans have been added to the employment rolls in under three years.\nLast month, African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment reached their lowest rates ever recorded. We are marshaling our nation’s vast energy abundance, and the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.  Wages are rising, incomes are soaring, and 2.5 million Americans have been lifted out of poverty in less than three years.\nAs we rebuild the unrivaled might of the American military, we are also revitalizing our alliances by making it very clear that all of our partners are expected to pay their fair share of the tremendous defense burden, which the United States has borne in the past.\nAt the center of our vision for national renewal is an ambitious campaign to reform international trade.  For decades, the international trading system has been easily exploited by nations acting in very bad faith.  As jobs were outsourced, a small handful grew wealthy at the expense of the middle class.\nIn America, the result was 4.2 million lost manufacturing jobs and $15 trillion in trade deficits over the last quarter century.  The United States is now taking that decisive action to end this grave economic injustice.  Our goal is simple: We want balanced trade that is both fair and reciprocal.\nWe have worked closely with our partners in Mexico and Canada to replace NAFTA with the brand new and hopefully bipartisan U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\nTomorrow, I will join Prime Minister Abe of Japan to continue our progress in finalizing a terrific new trade deal.\nAs the United Kingdom makes preparations to exit the European Union, I have made clear that we stand ready to complete an exceptional new trade agreement with the UK that will bring tremendous benefits to both of our countries.  We are working closely with Prime Minister Boris Johnson on a magnificent new trade deal.\nThe most important difference in America’s new approach on trade concerns our relationship with China.  In 2001, China was admitted to the World Trade Organization.  Our leaders then argued that this decision would compel China to liberalize its economy and strengthen protections to provide things that were unacceptable to us, and for private property and for the rule of law.  Two decades later, this theory has been tested and proven completely wrong.\nNot only has China declined to adopt promised reforms, it has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping, forced technology transfers, and the theft of intellectual property and also trade secrets on a grand scale.\nAs just one example, I recently met the CEO of a terrific American company, Micron Technology, at the White House.  Micron produces memory chips used in countless electronics.  To advance the Chinese government’s five-year economic plan, a company owned by the Chinese state allegedly stole Micron’s designs, valued at up to $8.7 billion.  Soon, the Chinese company obtains patents for nearly an identical product, and Micron was banned from selling its own goods in China.  But we are seeking justice.\nThe United States lost 60,000 factories after China entered the WTO.  This is happening to other countries all over the globe.\nThe World Trade Organization needs drastic change.  The second-largest economy in the world should not be permitted to declare itself a “developing country” in order to game the system at others’ expense.\nFor years, these abuses were tolerated, ignored, or even encouraged.  Globalism exerted a religious pull over past leaders, causing them to ignore their own national interests.\nBut as far as America is concerned, those days are over.  To confront these unfair practices, I placed massive tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese-made goods.  Already, as a result of these tariffs, supply chains are relocating back to America and to other nations, and billions of dollars are being paid to our Treasury.\nThe American people are absolutely committed to restoring balance to our relationship with China.  Hopefully, we can reach an agreement that would be beneficial for both countries.  But as I have made very clear, I will not accept a bad deal for the American people.\nAs we endeavor to stabilize our relationship, we’re also carefully monitoring the situation in Hong Kong.  The world fully expects that the Chinese government will honor its binding treaty, made with the British and registered with the United Nations, in which China commits to protect Hong Kong’s freedom, legal system, and democratic ways of life.  How China chooses to handle the situation will say a great deal about its role in the world in the future.  We are all counting on President Xi as a great leader.\nThe United States does not seek conflict with any other nation.  We desire peace, cooperation, and mutual gain with all.  But I will never fail to defend America’s interests.\nOne of the greatest security threats facing peace-loving nations today is the repressive regime in Iran.  The regime’s record of death and destruction is well known to us all.  Not only is Iran the world’s number one state sponsor of terrorism, but Iran’s leaders are fueling the tragic wars in both Syria and Yemen.\nAt the same time, the regime is squandering the nation’s wealth and future in a fanatical quest for nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them.  We must never allow this to happen.\nTo stop Iran’s path to nuclear weapons and missiles, I withdrew the United States from the terrible Iran nuclear deal, which has very little time remaining, did not allow inspection of important sites, and did not cover ballistic missiles.\nFollowing our withdrawal, we have implemented severe economic sanctions on the country.  Hoping to free itself from sanctions, the regime has escalated its violent and unprovoked aggression.  In response to Iran’s recent attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, we just imposed the highest level of sanctions on Iran’s central bank and sovereign wealth fund.\nAll nations have a duty to act.  No responsible government should subsidize Iran’s bloodlust.  As long as Iran’s menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be lifted; they will be tightened.  Iran’s leaders will have turned a proud nation into just another cautionary tale of what happens when a ruling class abandons its people and embarks on a crusade for personal power and riches.\nFor 40 years, the world has listened to Iran’s rulers as they lash out at everyone else for the problems they alone have created.  They conduct ritual chants of “Death to America” and traffic in monstrous anti-Semitism.  Last year the country’s Supreme Leader stated, “Israel is a malignant cancerous tumor…that has to be removed and eradicated: it is possible and it will happen.”  America will never tolerate such anti-Semitic hate.\nFanatics have long used hatred of Israel to distract from their own failures.  Thankfully, there is a growing recognition in the wider Middle East that the countries of the region share common interests in battling extremism and unleashing economic opportunity.  That is why it is so important to have full, normalized relations between Israel and its neighbors.  Only a relationship built on common interests, mutual respect, and religious tolerance can forge a better future.\nIran’s citizens deserve a government that cares about reducing poverty, ending corruption, and increasing jobs — not stealing their money to fund a massacre abroad and at home.\nAfter four decades of failure, it is time for Iran’s leaders to step forward and to stop threatening other countries, and focus on building up their own country.  It is time for Iran’s leaders to finally put the Iranian people first.\nAmerica is ready to embrace friendship with all who genuinely seek peace and respect.\nMany of America’s closest friends today were once our gravest foes.  The United States has never believed in permanent enemies.  We want partners, not adversaries.  America knows that while anyone can make war, only the most courageous can choose peace.\nFor this same reason, we have pursued bold diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula. I have told Kim Jong Un what I truly believe: that, like Iran, his country is full of tremendous untapped potential, but that to realize that promise, North Korea must denuclearize.\nAround the world, our message is clear: America’s goal is lasting, America’s goal is harmony, and America’s goal is not to go with these endless wars — wars that never end.\nWith that goal in mind, my administration is also pursuing the hope of a brighter future in Afghanistan.  Unfortunately, the Taliban has chosen to continue their savage attacks.  And we will continue to work with our coalition of Afghan partners to stamp out terrorism, and we will never stop working to make peace a reality.\nHere in the Western Hemisphere, we are joining with our partners to ensure stability and opportunity all across the region.  In that mission, one of our most critical challenges is illegal immigration, which undermines prosperity, rips apart societies, and empowers ruthless criminal cartels.\nMass illegal migration is unfair, unsafe, and unsustainable for everyone involved: the sending countries and the depleted countries.  And they become depleted very fast, but their youth is not taken care of and human capital goes to waste.\nThe receiving countries are overburdened with more migrants than they can responsibly accept.  And the migrants themselves are exploited, assaulted, and abused by vicious coyotes.  Nearly one third of women who make the journey north to our border are sexually assaulted along the way.  Yet, here in the United States and around the world, there is a growing cottage industry of radical activists and non-governmental organizations that promote human smuggling.  These groups encourage illegal migration and demand erasure of national borders.\nToday, I have a message for those open border activists who cloak themselves in the rhetoric of social justice: Your policies are not just.  Your policies are cruel and evil.  You are empowering criminal organizations that prey on innocent men, women, and children.  You put your own false sense of virtue before the lives, wellbeing, and [of] countless innocent people.  When you undermine border security, you are undermining human rights and human dignity.\nMany of the countries here today are coping with the challenges of uncontrolled migration.  Each of you has the absolute right to protect your borders, and so, of course, does our country.  Today, we must resolve to work together to end human smuggling, end human trafficking, and put these criminal networks out of business for good.\nTo our country, I can tell you sincerely: We are working closely with our friends in the region — including Mexico, Canada, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Panama — to uphold the integrity of borders and ensure safety and prosperity for our people.  I would like to thank President López Obrador of Mexico for the great cooperation we are receiving and for right now putting 27,000 troops on our southern border.  Mexico is showing us great respect, and I respect them in return.\nThe U.S., we have taken very unprecedented action to stop the flow of illegal immigration.  To anyone considering crossings of our border illegally, please hear these words: Do not pay the smugglers.  Do not pay the coyotes.  Do not put yourself in danger.  Do not put your children in danger.  Because if you make it here, you will not be allowed in; you will be promptly returned home.  You will not be released into our country.  As long as I am President of the United States, we will enforce our laws and protect our borders.\nFor all of the countries of the Western Hemisphere, our goal is to help people invest in the bright futures of their own nation.  Our region is full of such incredible promise: dreams waiting to be built and national destinies for all.  And they are waiting also to be pursued.\nThroughout the hemisphere, there are millions of hardworking, patriotic young people eager to build, innovate, and achieve.  But these nations cannot reach their potential if a generation of youth abandon their homes in search of a life elsewhere.  We want every nation in our region to flourish and its people to thrive in freedom and peace.\nIn that mission, we are also committed to supporting those people in the Western Hemisphere who live under brutal oppression, such as those in Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.\nAccording to a recent report from the U.N. Human Rights Council, women in Venezuela stand in line for 10 hours a day waiting for food.  Over 15,000 people have been detained as political prisoners.  Modern-day death squads are carrying out thousands of extrajudicial killings.\nThe dictator Maduro is a Cuban puppet, protected by Cuban bodyguards, hiding from his own people while Cuba plunders Venezuela’s oil wealth to sustain its own corrupt communist rule.\nSince I last spoke in this hall, the United States and our partners have built a historic coalition of 55 countries that recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela.\nTo the Venezuelans trapped in this nightmare: Please know that all of America is united behind you.  The United States has vast quantities of humanitarian aid ready and waiting to be delivered.  We are watching the Venezuela situation very closely.  We await the day when democracy will be restored, when Venezuela will be free, and when liberty will prevail throughout this hemisphere.\nOne of the most serious challenges our countries face is the specter of socialism.  It’s the wrecker of nations and destroyer of societies.\nEvents in Venezuela remind us all that socialism and communism are not about justice, they are not about equality, they are not about lifting up the poor, and they are certainly not about the good of the nation.  Socialism and communism are about one thing only: power for the ruling class.\nToday, I repeat a message for the world that I have delivered at home: America will never be a socialist country.\nIn the last century, socialism and communism killed 100 million people.  Sadly, as we see in Venezuela, the death toll continues in this country.  These totalitarian ideologies, combined with modern technology, have the power to excise [exercise] new and disturbing forms of suppression and domination.\nFor this reason, the United States is taking steps to better screen foreign technology and investments and to protect our data and our security.  We urge every nation present to do the same.\nFreedom and democracy must be constantly guarded and protected, both abroad and from within.  We must always be skeptical of those who want conformity and control.  Even in free nations, we see alarming signs and new challenges to liberty.\nA small number of social media platforms are acquiring immense power over what we can see and over what we are allowed to say.  A permanent political class is openly disdainful, dismissive, and defiant of the will of the people.  A faceless bureaucracy operates in secret and weakens democratic rule.  Media and academic institutions push flat-out assaults on our histories, traditions, and values.\nIn the United States, my administration has made clear to social media companies that we will uphold the right of free speech.  A free society cannot allow social media giants to silence the voices of the people, and a free people must never, ever be enlisted in the cause of silencing, coercing, canceling, or blacklisting their own neighbors.\nAs we defend American values, we affirm the right of all people to live in dignity.  For this reason, my administration is working with other nations to stop criminalizing of homosexuality, and we stand in solidarity with LGBTQ people who live in countries that punish, jail, or execute individuals based upon sexual orientation.\nWe are also championing the role of women in our societies.  Nations that empower women are much wealthier, safer, and much more politically stable.  It is therefore vital not only to a nation’s prosperity, but also is vital to its national security, to pursue women’s economic development.\nGuided by these principles, my administration launched the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiatives.  The W-GDP is first-ever government-wide approach to women’s economic empowerment, working to ensure that women all over the planet have the legal right to own and inherit property, work in the same industries as men, travel freely, and access credit and institutions.\nYesterday, I was also pleased to host leaders for a discussion about an ironclad American commitment: protecting religious leaders and also protecting religious freedom.  This fundamental right is under growing threat around the world.  Hard to believe, but 80 percent of the world’s population lives in countries where religious liberty is in significant danger or even completely outlawed.  Americans will never fire or tire in our effort to defend and promote freedom of worship and religion.  We want and support religious liberty for all.\nAmericans will also never tire of defending innocent life.  We are aware that many United Nations projects have attempted to assert a global right to taxpayer-funded abortion on demand, right up until the moment of delivery.  Global bureaucrats have absolutely no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that wish to protect innocent life.  Like many nations here today, we in America believe that every child — born and unborn — is a sacred gift from God.\nThere is no circumstance under which the United States will allow international entries [entities] to trample on the rights of our citizens, including the right to self-defense.  That is why, this year, I announced that we will never ratify the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty, which would threaten the liberties of law-abiding American citizens.  The United States will always uphold our constitutional right to keep and bear arms.  We will always uphold our Second Amendment.\nThe core rights and values America defends today were inscribed in America’s founding documents.  Our nation’s Founders understood that there will always be those who believe they are entitled to wield power and control over others. Tyranny advances under many names and many theories, but it always comes down to the desire for domination.  It protects not the interests of many, but the privilege of few.\nOur Founders gave us a system designed to restrain this dangerous impulse.  They chose to entrust American power to those most invested in the fate of our nation: a proud and fiercely independent people.\nThe true good of a nation can only be pursued by those who love it: by citizens who are rooted in its history, who are nourished by its culture, committed to its values, attached to its people, and who know that its future is theirs to build or theirs to lose.  Patriots see a nation and its destiny in ways no one else can.\nLiberty is only preserved, sovereignty is only secured, democracy is only sustained, greatness is only realized, by the will and devotion of patriots.  In their spirit is found the strength to resist oppression, the inspiration to forge legacy, the goodwill to seek friendship, and the bravery to reach for peace.  Love of our nations makes the world better for all nations.\nSo to all the leaders here today, join us in the most fulfilling mission a person could have, the most profound contribution anyone can make: Lift up your nations.  Cherish your culture.  Honor your histories.  Treasure your citizens. Make your countries strong, and prosperous, and righteous.  Honor the dignity of your people, and nothing will be outside of your reach.\nWhen our nations are greater, the future will be brighter, our people will be happier, and our partnerships will be stronger.\nWith God’s help, together we will cast off the enemies of liberty and overcome the oppressors of dignity.  We will set new standards of living and reach new heights of human achievement. We will rediscover old truths, unravel old mysteries, and make thrilling new breakthroughs.  And we will find more beautiful friendship and more harmony among nations than ever before.\nMy fellow leaders, the path to peace and progress, and freedom and justice, and a better world for all humanity, begins at home.\nThank you.  God bless you.  God bless the nations of the world.  And God bless America.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)\nEND\n10:49 A.M.

EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, thank you very much.  We’re glad to be joined by the President of Iraq and his representatives.  And I will say that we’ve had a very good couple of meetings with Iraq.  We’re doing well with Iraq.  It’s been a very long and complicated but friendly relationship, especially over the last little while.   I was in Iraq a little while ago, as you know.  And it’s fascinating what’s taking place.\nSo we’re going to — we have a lot to talk about.  There’s things to talk about that we can’t talk about in front of you, but we have a lot of good things to talk about.  And you’re doing a fantastic job.  Thank you very much.\nPRESIDENT SALIH:  Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.\nPRESIDENT SALIH:  Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Please.\nPRESIDENT SALIH:  It’s an opportunity, Mr. President, to reaffirm our gratitude to the United States and the international coalition that has come to help us overcome the tyranny of ISIS and terrorism.\nThis was an amazing battle.  And Iraqis were in the forefront of this battle, but your support has been absolutely crucial, and we appreciate it.  Now, the task of rebuilding Iraq, reconstructing Iraq, affirming the sovereignty of Iraq, and being a partner in the neighborhood for a more stable Middle East is a hope and an aspiration that we look for the help of the United States and the help of the international community.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I understand.  And it has been a great achievement.  We took 100 percent of the caliphate from ISIS.  And ISIS — now we have thousands and thousands of people that we’ve captured.  These people have done a lot of destruction, not only in that area, in a lot of other areas.  But, as you know, we have thousands of people.  We’ll talk about that also because we’re going to have to do something — put them on trial, et cetera, et cetera.\nBut we’ve captured thousands of ISIS fighters and taken back 100 percent of the caliphate.  And when I first became President, it was a mess.  It was a big mess.  And we — we all worked together and we got it done, but it was a great achievement, so we appreciate that.  And we look forward to our discussion.\nThank you.  Thank you very much.\nQ    Thank you.  Mr. President, good to see you.  Iraq has declared that it won’t allow its territory to be used as a launching pad against its neighbors.  Can you assure us that you can control all the rogue elements, especially with the (inaudible), especially that we have two rockets landing?\nPRESIDENT SALIH:  It’s our sovereign responsibility.  It’s our sovereign responsibility to abide by our constitution, not — Iraq not to be used as a base for any threat against our neighbors.  It is work in progress, and Iraq has been a constructive player in the neighborhood, trying to assure all our neighbors that the stability and sovereignty of Iraq is a common interest.\nAnd a lot of things, in that regard, is happening, and I’m looking forward to talking to the President about it.\nQ    Mr. President, the French President just now said that it’s time to negotiate with Iran.  Do you believe that the time is now to negotiate with Iran?  And are you going to meet with him today?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, they would like to negotiate.  We haven’t really worked that out.  They’re here, we’re here, but we have not agreed to that yet.  But they would like to negotiate.  And it would certainly make sense, but we have not agreed to that yet.\nQ    Are you meeting with Mr. Macron?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  He’s also talking to us.  A number of people are.  So is Prime Minister Khan of Pakistan and a lot of people; Chancellor Merkel — just left Chancellor Merkel.  And she’s very much involved.  We have a lot of people involved.  A lot of people would like to get us to the table.  We’ll see what happens.  But, so far, we have not agreed to a meeting.\nQ    President Trump —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Say it?\nQ    Have you asked Prime Minister Khan to mediate with Iran?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, he’d like to do that, and we have a very good relationship.  And there’s a chance that that could happen.  But, no, I haven’t spoken.  He actually asked me.  He thought it would be a good idea to meet.\nAnd we’re here.  We’re in New York together.  And we have the time to do it, although we’ve done a lot of bilats in the last two days.  We’ve had tremendous success.  I was treated very nicely on the speech.  A lot of good reviews on what we had to say.  And so, I appreciate that.  The media was actually very good on the speech.\nQ    Mr. President, your reaction to Speaker Pelosi saying today that she is moving toward an impeachment announcement later this afternoon?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I haven’t heard this.  Look, it’s just a continuation of the witch hunt.  It’s the worst witch hunt in political history.  We have the strongest economy we’ve ever had.  We have the best unemployment numbers we’ve ever had.  African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, lowest in history.  Best numbers we’ve ever had.  Our country is doing phenomenally well.\nWe have rebuilt our military to the tune of $2.5 trillion.  We have the strongest military on Earth.  If you look at the vets, if you look at any group, they’re doing fantastically well.\nSo the country is doing the best it’s ever done, and I just heard that she’d like to impeach.  We also just had Rasmussen, as you heard, just came out with a poll.  We’re at 53, and they say 53 plus maybe 10.  A lot of people say that, because you add about 10 percent to the Trump polls because some people don’t want to talk; they just want to go out and do it, and they know what’s good.\nOur country is doing the best it’s ever done.  They’re going to lose the election and they figure this is a thing to do.  This never happened where we’re in the election, and — I mean, if she does that, they all say that’s a positive for me, for the election.  You could also say, “Who needs it?”  It’s bad for the country.  Then they wonder why they don’t get gun legislation done.  Then they wonder why they don’t get drug prices lowered.  Because all they do is talk nonsense.  No more infrastructure bills.  No more anything.  All they do — that’s all they do.\nYou watch Jerry Nadler and Schiff — you know, Schiff has been doing this stuff for three and a half years.  It’s the craziest thing anybody has ever seen.\nAnd other countries — like today we’re with Iraq and we were with other countries during the day, and every one of them says how crazy it is.  We have the strongest country in the world, the best economy we’ve ever had.  And she’s talking impeachment.  So I think that — and, by the way, she hasn’t even seen the phone call.  The phone call was perfect.  The call that wasn’t perfect and the words that weren’t perfect were Joe Biden with respect to his son.  And his son takes away millions of dollars out of Ukraine, and millions of dollars out of China, and you don’t talk about that.  It’s a real disgrace.\nBut the good news is, the voters get it.  This is why they say it’s good for the election.  But you know what?  It’s bad for the country.  What she’s doing is very bad — if it’s true.  I can’t even believe that it’s true.  How can you do this and you haven’t even seen the phone call?\nThe whistleblower, they say, was second-hand or third-hand.  And it was reported — I have no idea who the whistleblower is.  I guess I could find out.  Maybe I couldn’t find out.  But they say it was a very partisan person — the whistleblower.  But it was second- or third-hand.  Never heard the call.\nBut I have better than that.  We have the whole transcript of the call, which will be released tomorrow.  And comments will be put with respect.  It was a perfect call.  There was no quid pro quo, unlike Biden.  There was no nothing.  It was a perfect call.  A very nice call.  And, in fact, I thought this was very nice.  Ukraine just came out.  It made a very good statement.  It was a very good call.  There was no pressure put on them whatsoever.\nThank you all very much.  Appreciate it.\nEND\n3:39 P.M.

EDT\nSECRETARY-GENERAL GUTERRES:  President Donald Trump, distinguished heads of state and government, excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen: It is wonderful to be, again, together in New York.  This city is a wonderful city, a wonderful inspiration for us all.  And I think if there is a privilege to be Secretary-General of the United Nations, it’s to be able to work in New York.\nI know, Mr. President, New York is your city.  You are a New Yorker.  And indeed, that inspiration is vital for the success of our work.\nOn the other hand, we have many other sources of inspiration coming from your country, the United States of America.  The Charter of the United Nations starts with the sentences, “We the peoples.”  That’s exactly the sentence with which your Constitution starts.\nAnd, on the other hand, if we are going to celebrate tomorrow the 75th — tomorrow — next year, the 75th anniversary of the U.N., I would like to remind us all that we are celebrating this year the 50th anniversary of the moon landing — I’m sure one of the most remarkable achievements of humankind in the world.\nNow, after the moon landing — immediately after, the astronauts came to the United Nations.  And the crowd was so big that they had to go to the *North Lounge*258.  And there, Neil Armstrong — that was a man that wouldn’t speak very much, but usually very wise in what he would say — said the following sentence that I dare to read to all of you.  And I’m quoting: “I can tell that you share with us the hope that we, citizens of the Earth, who can solve the problems of leaving Earth, can also solve the problems of [living] on it.”\nI think that these words are also a fantastic inspiration for what we have to do: create, together, an Earth on which we all can live in peace and in prosperity.  And I would like to raise my glass to the hospitality — warm hospitality — of our host city and host country, New York and United States, and to the wellbeing and prosperity of we the peoples of the world.  Cheers.  (Applause.)\n(A toast is given.)  (Applause.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, Mr. Secretary-General, you’ve become my friend.  And we have had a lot of time together — hours and hours — talking about world problems, world events.  And a lot of progress has been made.\nYou know, I’ve long said that I think the United Nations is an institution with more potential than virtually any institution I can think of.  It’s called the “potential of war,” which is bad, and “peace,” which is great.  And I think we’ve been doing a great job on the “peace” aspect of it.\nBut we’ve had many great meetings with Angela and — thank you very much.  The Polish people are very happy.  I’ve heard that today.  They were very happy with your performance yesterday.  Great job.\nBut I just want to thank everybody for being here.  It’s an honor to have you in the United States, an honor to have you in New York City.  And the United Nations is very, very special.  And most importantly, I want to congratulate you on the incredible job you’re doing.  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary-General.\nThank you.  Thank you, everybody.  Thank you.  (Applause.)\nEND\n1:33 P.M.

        "text": "United Nations HeadquartersNew York, New York\n12:17 P.M. EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  It’s a great honor, as you know, to be with — because we were together just the other day in front of 59,000 people in the stadium, and that was a great day — Prime Minister Modi of India.\nAnd we have many things to discuss.  One of them — and perhaps in our case, one of the biggest ones is trade.  We do a lot of trade together and we’re working on that.\nWe’ll also be discussing Kashmir.  I imagine it’ll be brought up.  And other things.  But we have plenty to discuss.  And the relationship has never been better, I say, than it is right now, between the Prime Minister, myself, India, and the United States.  So, it’s a great honor to have you.  Thank you very much.\nPRIME MINISTER MODI:  (As interpreted.)  First of all, I would like express my gratitude to President Trump that he was with me in Houston, day before yesterday.  He took out time from his busy schedule to go to Houston.  And he spent a lot of time with us.\nAnd I think for the Indian community, people of Indian origin in the United States, this was an occasion of great pride.  And for this, once again, let me thank President Trump from the bottom of my heart.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER MODI:  (As interpreted.)  After the formation of the new government, we haven’t even completed four months, but during this period of time I’ve had the occasion to meet President Trump three times now.  And we’ve had very detailed and fruitful discussions on many issues.\nIn the world, between the oldest and the largest democracy, this kind of nearness — this relationship of ease and this continuous engagement — I think our countries coming together, which believe in democratic values, I think that’s a very good sign for the world.  For India and the United States, notably, we are very close friends, but this is a friendship that is based on values, and this will continue to strengthen in the times to come.\nAs far as trade is concerned, I’m very happy that the day before yesterday, in Houston, in my presence there was an agreement signed by the Indian company, Petronet, for an amount of $2.5 billion, which is the amount of investment that the Indian company is going to do in the energy sector.  And this will mean that in the years to come, in the decades to come, this will result in trade of an amount of $60 billion and create 50,000 jobs, which I think is a very big initiative taken by India.\nPresident Trump is definitely my friend, but he is also a friend of India.  And relations between India and the United States are proceeding at a very good and fast pace.\nOnce again, let me thank President Trump.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.\nPRIME MINISTER MODI:  Thank you.\nQ    Mr. President, you’ve mentioned — President Trump, you’ve mentioned trade.  You — and Prime Minister Modi had, during the Houston event, said that you know the art of the deal.  Can we expect something on a trade deal in talks today?  Or what, the U.S. and India, they can do together to boost trade ties going forward?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I think very soon.  We’re doing very well.  And Bob Lighthizer, who’s right here, was negotiating with India and their very capable representatives.  And I think very soon we’ll have a trade deal.  We’ll have the larger deal down the road a little bit, but we will have a trade deal very soon.\nGo ahead.\nQ    You’ve been talking about, you know, clamping down on terrorism from across the globe.  Pakistan has been the global epicenter of terrorism.  You spoke about it in Houston.  How do you make sure that you clamp down on terrorism from Pakistan?  Because that is posing a threat to democracies like the U.S. and India.  Even the business interests suffer because of continuing terrorism.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I had a very good meeting with Prime Minister Khan.  It was a long meeting and we discussed a lot.  And I think he’d like to see something happen that would be very fruitful, very peaceful.  And I think that will happen, ultimately.  I really believe that these two great gentlemen will get together and work something.\nI also — you know, you mentioned Pakistan, but Iran would have to be at the top of the list.  Because if you look at terrorist states, that’s been the number one for a long time.\nBut I really believe that Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Khan, they get along — they will get along when they get to know each other.  And I think a lot of good things will come from that meeting.\nQ    Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan admitted that thirty, forty thousand terrorists are still in Pakistan.  And yesterday, at the think-tank event, he again admitted that the Pakistan army and ISI trained al Qaeda.  Separately, there are reports that thousands of terrorists are ready to enter through (inaudible) India.  In this backdrop, what would you like to give message to Pakistan?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I mean, the message is not for me to give, it’s for Prime Minister Modi to give.  And I think he gave that loud and clear on — the other day when we were together.  He gave a pretty loud message.  And I’m sure he’ll be able to handle that situation.\nYes, sir.  Go ahead.\nQ    President Trump, this is a spectacular show you had with Prime Minister Modi in Houston.  What are the significance of this event for India-U.S. relations and your personal chemistry with Prime Minister?  Thank you.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, my personal chemistry is as good as it can get.  I have great respect.  I have great admiration.  And I really like him — that’s another thing.  And he’s a great gentleman and a great leader.\nAnd I remember India before.  Now, not intimately, but I remember India before, and it was very torn.  There was a lot of dissension, a lot of fighting.  And he brought it all together, like a father would bring it together.  Maybe he’s the father of India.  We’ll call him “the father of India.”  I think that’s not so bad.  But he brought things together.  And you don’t hear that anymore.  So I think he’s done a fantastic job.\nBut I think that what the event showed is how much I like the country of India and how much I like your Prime Minister.\nThere was tremendous spirit in that room, too.  And they love this gentleman to my right.  They really do.  Those people went crazy.  That was like Elvis.  That was like an American — he’s like an American version of Elvis.  (Laughter.)  It was like we brought in the middle of an all-American deal; Elvis Presley came back.  No, he was — that was quite something.  They love your Prime Minister.  It’s a great thing.\nQ    Mr. President, in Houston, you said that you stand with India in fight against Islamic radical terrorism.  How do you see the statement coming from the Pakistani Prime Minister admitting that the Pakistani state, the ISI trained al Qaeda?  How do you see —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I haven’t heard that.  I haven’t heard that.  And I know this: that your Prime Minister will take care of it.  So if there’s a problem, he’ll — if there’s a problem, he’ll take care of it.  It would be great if they could work out something on Kashmir.  We all want to see that.  I’m sure we all want to see it.\nQ    But isn’t there a bigger issue, sir?  Pakistan state-sponsored terror — is there a roadmap to deal with Pakistan state-sponsored terror?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Boy, you have great reporters.  I wish I had reporters like this.  (Laughter.)  You’re doing better than anybody I’ve ever heard.  Where do you find these reporters?  This is a great thing.\nNo, look, you have a great Prime Minister.  He’ll solve the problem.  I have no doubt about it.\nThank you very much everybody.  Thank you.  Thank you.\nEND\n12:27 P.M.

EDT\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, thank you very much everyone.  It’s great to be with my friend, Boris Johnson.  He just got a position that he’s having a very easy time with.  It’s much easier than he thought.  (Laughter.)  They’re saying, “Is it tougher or easier?”  He said, “Well, it’s…” — I guess, what he expected.  I think it’s pretty much what you expected.\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:  It is.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And he’s doing a fantastic job.  Not easy.  But doing a really good job.  And I think you’re going to make great progress come October, come November.  But great progress for the country, long term.\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:  October.  October.  October the 31st.  (Inaudible.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  The results are going to be — the results are going to start to show in November.  But it looks to me like he has made some great progress.  So it’s an honor to have him here.\nWe’re going to be discussing trade.  We can quadruple our trade with UK.  And we can, I think, really do a big job.  Bob Lighthizer is here — our trade representative.  Your trade representative is here.  And they’re already scheduled today to continue negotiations.\nBut we can have substantially more trade with UK, and we look forward to doing that.  So we’ll talk about other things also.  It’s great to have you, Boris.\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:  Well, thank you very much.  It’s great to be here.  And I certainly hope that we can make a lot of progress quite fast on trade.  We’ve got our Secretary of State for International Trade, Liz Truss, is here.  We hope to get going on that, always remembering that the NHS is not for sale.\nBut everything else — there’s a huge amount we can — we can do.\nAnd I guess we’ll also talk a bit about Iran —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  We’ll be talking about that.\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:  — and some of those difficult issues where I think we share a common perspective, and we want to dial things down but also make sure that people in the Gulf don’t get the wrong idea about what they can get away with.  That’s a complicated issue.  We have to make progress there as well.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  We’ll be talking about many things, and we look forward to it.  And we’ll start in just a minute.\nSo thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you.\nQ    Prime Minister Johnson, some of your critics are saying that you should resign because you misled the Queen with regard to shutting Parliament down.  How do you respond to that?\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:  Well, as I said earlier on — thank you very much.  As I said earlier on, let’s be absolutely clear: We respect the judiciary in our country, we respect the court.\nI disagree profoundly with what they had to say.  I think it was entirely right to go ahead with a plan for a Queen’s speech.  This is a — with the longest period.  We haven’t had a Queen’s speech for 400 years.  We’ve got a dynamic domestic agenda we need to be getting on with: more police on the streets, investment in our National Health Service, improving our education.  We need to get on with that.\nAnd, frankly, I think we need to get on with Brexit.  That’s the overwhelming view of the British people.  Whether they voted to leave or remain, they want to get this thing done by October the 31st.  And that’s what we’re going to do.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  That was a very nasty question from a great American reporter.  I’m shocked.\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:  Was that — no, was that an American reporter?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  That’s an American reporter.\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:  Was it?  I thought —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  And he’s a good one.\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:  But I think he was asking a question, to be fair, that a lot of British reporters would have asked me.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, now that we have that out of the way — he’s not — I’ll tell you, I know him well: He’s not going anywhere.  Don’t worry about him.\nOkay, go ahead.  Any other questions?\nQ    Any advice for the Prime Minister as to how he should deal with the judges?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, I think he’s dealing very well.  Everything I see here is what — look, I’ve watched it very closely.  He’s a friend of mine.  I tend to watch friends closer than enemies, but the enemies you have to watch in a different way.\nI think he’s doing very well.  It’s a complicated subject, but they took a vote, and the vote was — I was there.  I happened to be there the day of that vote.\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:  Were you down at the vote?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I made a prediction, even.  I even made a prediction.  And it was a correct prediction.  And, you know, that was a long time ago.  And it takes a man like this to get it done.  And they have to get it done; otherwise, it would be a terrible thing to do it any other way.\nI don’t see another vote.  I don’t see anything happening.  I think he’s going to get it done.\nQ    Mr. President, what was your reaction when you heard these UK supreme court decision?  What was your reaction to it?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  I had no reaction.  I just asked Boris.  And, you know, to him, it’s another day in the office.  He’s a professional.  It’s just another day in the office.\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:  Yeah, well, it’s — tomorrow is another day in Parliament.  That’s what he means.  (Laughter.)\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  You know, we had — we had, Boris, the first couple of months, we had been — I think we were 0 for 7 with the Supreme Court.  And since then, we won the wall, we won asylum, we won some of the biggest ones.  We’ve had a great streak going.\nBut we — we started off, we were 0 for 7.  And then as you will report — in fact, the first time we won, you were, like, shocked that we won.  And since then, we’ve almost run the table.  We’ve won a lot of decisions.  So I’m sure that’s going to happen to you.\nPRIME MINISTER JOHNSON:  Well, we’re not counting our chickens.  And we’re full of respect, as I say, to the justices of our — (laughter) — supreme court.  But we’re going to — we’re going to push on.  We’re going to respect what the court had to say, but we’re going to get on and deliver Brexit.  That’s the — I think that’s what the British people want to see.\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  In other words, he’s been very nice to the court, please.  Okay?  He has —\nQ    Mr. President —\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  He has total respect for the court.\nYeah, Jeff.\nQ    Mr. President, on a separate subject, can you explain why aid to Ukraine was stopped?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:  Because I think that other countries should be paying also.  Why is the United States the only one paying to Ukraine?  And I’ve been talking about this for a long time — not only with respect to Ukraine, but a lot of other countries.\nBut, frankly, why isn’t Germany — I just met with the Chancellor — why isn’t Germany, why isn’t France, why aren’t these other countries paying payment?  Why are we paying all the time?  And nobody has given, I believe, more to Ukraine.  You know, President Obama used to send pillows and sheets.  I sent anti-tank weapons and a lot of things to Ukraine.  We think that it’s very important and — by the way, I don’t know if you know it or not, that payment was made.\nBut I wanted to get other countries.  Other countries should also pay because, frankly, it affects them more.  I mean, that’s a barrier.  That’s a wall between Russia and the UK.  And they don’t pay.  And why are they not paying?  Why is it always the United States that’s paying?  And I made that loud and clear.  I told that to Mick Mulvaney.  I told it to a lot of people.  Where’s Mick?  Wherever he is.  But I told it to a lot of different people.  I told it to Mike.  I told it to two Mikes.  I told it to Steve.\nI keep asking the same — I said it to Wilbur Ross.  I keep asking the same question: Why is it that the United States is always paying these foreign countries and other foreign countries that, frankly, are much great — much more affected, and they’re not?\nSo I said, “Hold it up.  Let’s get other people to pay.”  And then everybody called me: “Oh, please can we pay?”  And I said — and there was never any quid pro quo.  The letter was beautiful.  It was a perfect letter.\nIt was — unlike Biden, who — by the way, what he said was a horror.  And ask how his son made millions of dollars from Ukraine, made millions of dollars from China, even though he had no expertise whatsoever.  Okay?  So what he did was a real problem.  With us, there was no pressure applied, no nothing.\nOkay, folks.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.\nEND\n11:42 A.M.
